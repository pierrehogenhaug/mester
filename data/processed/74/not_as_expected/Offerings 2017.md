**£200,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2022**
_Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Drax Group Holdings Limited and certain of its subsidiaries_

Drax Finco plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”), is offering £350.0 million aggregate principal
amount of its 4[ 1]/4% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2022 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and £200.0 million aggregate principal amount of its senior secured floating
rate notes due 2022 (the “Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the
“Indenture”) to be dated on or around 5 May 2017 (the “Issue Date”). The offering of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes are collectively referred to
herein as the “Offering”.

The Fixed Rate Notes will bear interest at the rate of 4.250% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrear on 1 May and 1 November of each year, commencing
on 1 November 2017. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on 1 May 2022. The Issuer may redeem the Fixed Rate Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after 1 May
2019 at the redemption prices specified in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). At any time prior to 1 May 2019, the Issuer will be entitled, at
its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Fixed Rate Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. At any time prior to 1 May 2019, the Issuer
will also be entitled, at its option, to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes (including the original principal amount of any
Additional Fixed Rate Notes) with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum, if at least 60% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes remain outstanding (including the original principal amount of any Additional Fixed Rate Notes).

The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month GBP LIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus
(ii) 4.000%, payable quarterly in arrear on 1 February, 1 May, 1 August and 1 November of each year, commencing on 1 August 2017. The Floating Rate Notes will

Offering Memorandum. At any time prior to 1 May 2018, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Floating Rate Notes at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Floating Rate Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole”
premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain
events constituting a change of control or upon the occurrence of certain asset sales, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding
Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. See “Description of Notes” for
further information.

The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior
obligations. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Guarantees” and each, a “Guarantee”) by Drax Group Holdings Limited (“DGHL”) and
certain of DGHL’s direct and indirect subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with DGHL, the “Guarantors”). Each of the Guarantees will rank pari
_passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of each Guarantor, and will rank senior in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of_
each Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee. The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by (i) a first-ranking share charge
over all of the issued share capital of DGHL and the Issuer; (ii) a security assignment of certain receivables owed to Drax Group plc by DGHL; (iii) a first-ranking
share charge over all of the issued share capital of each Subsidiary Guarantor; (iv) a first-ranking charge over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, including the
receivables owed to the Issuer in respect of the Proceeds Loans pursuant to which the proceeds of the Offering are on-lent; and (v) a first-ranking charge over
substantially all of the assets of each Guarantor, including, with respect to U.S. Guarantors, a first-ranking all asset security over assets located in the United States
other than any real property (collectively, the “Collateral”).

The Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to restrictions on enforcement and other intercreditor arrangements. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_Security” for further information. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) to be entered into in connection with the Offering, in the event of_
a distressed disposal of the Collateral or an enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral
only after the lenders under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, counterparties to certain hedging agreements (including under the Secured Trading Line (as defined
herein)) and lenders or creditors under certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement) have been repaid in full. The Issuer’s obligations in respect of the Notes may be released in certain circumstances. In addition, the Guarantees and the
security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital
_Structure”, “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”, “Description of Notes—Note Guarantees—Releases of the Note Guarantees”_
and “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens” for further information.

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. This document constitutes the listing particulars (“Listing Particulars”) in respect of the admission of the
Notes to the Official List and to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Application has been made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
for the approval of this document as Listing Particulars. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to
have the Notes admitted for trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market (the “Euro MTF Market”). However, there is no assurance that this
application will be accepted. The Euro MTF Market is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments,
as amended. This Offering Memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Luxembourg Law on Prospectuses for Securities dated 10 July 2005, as amended.

The Notes will be in registered form in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be represented by
one or more global notes, which we expect will be delivered to investors in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking,
_société anonyme (“Clearstream”) on or about the Issue Date. Interests in a global note will be exchangeable for the relevant definitive Notes only in certain limited_
circumstances. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”.

results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors
emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks
on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements. Due to such uncertainties and risks, investors are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as at the date hereof. We urge you to read this Offering
Memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations of Drax”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_

All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, including those set forth under “Risk Factors”.

Indenture, will not provide a Guarantee in favour of the Notes and will not grant security in favour of the Notes, except with
respect to the shares it owns in DGHL. Drax Group plc is a holding company and as at 31 December 2016 its only material

    - the audited non-statutory consolidated financial statements of Opus Energy Group Limited and its subsidiaries (the
“Opus Group”) as of and for each of the years ended 31 March 2014, 2015 and 2016, including the related notes

    - unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the Opus Group as of and for the nine months ended
31 December 2015 and 2016, including the related notes thereto (the “Opus Group Unaudited Interim Financial
**Statements”, together with the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements and the Opus Group Audited Financial**
Statements, the “Financial Statements”).

The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”), and have been audited by Deloitte LLP. Drax Group plc is
the indirect parent of the Issuer, and the Issuer intends to provide a copy of the consolidated financial statements of Drax
Group plc to holders of the Notes following the Issue Date.

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum in respect of the Group does not constitute statutory
accounts within the meaning of section 434(3) of the UK Companies Act 2006 (the “Companies Act”). Statutory accounts
for Drax Group plc for the financial years ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016 have been reported on by the company’s
auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The report of the auditor was (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a
reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and (iii) did
not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act.

The Opus Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, and have been audited by
KPMG LLP. The Opus Group Audited Financial Statements reflect the first time financial information for the Opus Group
has been prepared under IFRS and accordingly IFRS 1 has been applied. The notes to the Opus Group Audited Financial
Statements include reconciliations between the financial information reported in accordance with generally accepted
accounting practice in the UK (“UK GAAP”) and IFRS.

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum in respect of the Opus Group does not constitute
statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434(3) of the Companies Act. Statutory accounts for Opus Energy Group
Limited for the financial years ended 31 March 2014, 2015 and 2016, which were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP,


-----

have been reported on by the company’s auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The report of the auditor was
(i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without
qualifying their report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act.

The Opus Group Unaudited Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement requirements of IFRS.

In addition, this Offering Memorandum includes unaudited non-statutory consolidated financial data for the Opus
Group for the twelve-month period ended 31 December 2016, which has been derived by adding the unaudited non-statutory
condensed consolidated financial information of the Opus Group for the nine-month period ended 31 December 2016 to the
non-statutory consolidated financial information of the Opus Group for the year ended 31 March 2016 and subtracting the
non-statutory unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of the Opus Group for the nine-month period ended
31 December 2015. The unaudited non-statutory financial data for the twelve-month period ended 31 December 2016 has
been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of the Group’s or
the Opus Group’s financial reporting, is for illustrative purposes only, is not necessarily indicative of the Group’s or the Opus
Group’s results of operations for any future period or the Group’s or the Opus Group’s financial condition at any future date,
and has not been audited.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas
involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
financial statements, are disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements.

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable
accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, which would apply if the
Notes were being registered with the SEC. There could be significant differences between IFRS and generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), as applied to the Group and the Opus Group. We
neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile the Group or the Opus Group’s IFRS financial
statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in
making their investment decision. The Indenture will impose no obligation on us to reconcile our future financial statements
prepared under IFRS to U.S. GAAP.

_Structure—Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against our independent auditors in_
_respect of the Drax Group Financial Statements and against the Opus Group’s independent auditors in respect of the Opus_
_Group Financial Statements” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports of Deloitte LLP and KPMG LLP of each_
of the Group and the Opus Group, respectively.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited pro forma consolidated financial data of the Group, as adjusted
to give pro forma effect to the Opus Acquisition and the Refinancing as if it occurred on 31 December 2016 for balance sheet
purposes and 1 January 2016 for income statement purposes. The summary unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS, under which the assets
and liabilities of Opus will be recorded by Drax Group plc at their respective fair values as at the date of completion of the
Opus Acquisition. The excess purchase consideration over the carrying amount of the net assets of Opus has been attributed
to goodwill and other intangibles. The fair value adjustment, when finalised, may be material. The pro forma adjustments are
preliminary and based on estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and have
been prepared to illustrate the estimated effect of the Opus Acquisition and the Refinancing. Pro forma adjustments reflected
in the pro forma financial information are based on items that are factually supportable and directly attributable to the Opus
Acquisition and the Opus Acquisition-related financing, including the Refinancing. The unaudited pro forma consolidated
financial data is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative of the consolidated results
of operations or financial position that the Group would have reported had the Opus Acquisition or the Refinancing been
completed on 31 December 2016, 1 January 2016 or any other date and should not be taken as indicative of the Group’s
future consolidated results of operations or financial position following consummation of the Opus Acquisition and the
Refinancing.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 has been prepared based
on (i) the historical consolidated financial statements for Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2016; and
(ii) unaudited non-statutory consolidated financial data for the 12 months ended 31 December 2016 of the Opus Group (the
“Opus LTM Financial Information”). The Opus LTM Financial Information was derived by adding the non-statutory
consolidated income statement data of the Opus Group for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2016 to the unaudited nonstatutory consolidated income statement data for the nine months ended 31 December 2016 and deducting the unaudited non

-----

statutory income statement data for the nine months ended 31 December 2015. This data has been prepared solely for the
purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of the Opus Group’s financial reporting, has
not been audited and is not necessarily representative of the Opus Group’s results of operations for any future period. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 is based on the assumption that the Opus
Acquisition and the Refinancing was completed on the balance sheet date.

The unaudited pro forma financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions
underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma financial data have been audited or reviewed in
accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including CfD Adjusted Revenue,
EBITDA, CfD Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, CfD Adjusted EBITDA Margin, underlying profit, net debt, Pro Forma
CfD Adjusted Revenue, Pro Forma CfD Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma consolidated net debt and certain other measures (the
“Non-IFRS Measures”) that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or the accounting standards of any
other jurisdiction. We define the following Non-IFRS Measures as follows:

    - “CfD Adjusted Revenue” as Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 adjusted to: (i) exclude the support of
the RO Scheme from 1 January 2016 in respect of the third biomass-fired generation unit, and (ii) include the impact
of our CfD as if the contract had become effective on 1 January 2016 (including the impact on the value of the
ROCs earned by our first and second biomass-fired generation unit);

    - “EBITDA” (in respect of the Group) as profit before interest, tax, depreciation (including asset obsolescence
charges and losses on disposal), amortisation, unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and the one-off
settlement in connection with the “Community Energy Savings Programme” (“CESP”) in 2014;

    - “EBITDA” (in respect of the Opus Group) as profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation;

    - “CfD Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2016 further adjusted to: (i) exclude the
support of the RO Scheme from 1 January 2016 in respect of the third biomass-fired generation unit, and (ii) include
the impact of our CfD as if the contract had become effective on 1 January 2016 (including the impact on the value
of the ROCs earned by our first and second biomass-fired generation unit);

    - “EBITDA Margin” for a given period as EBITDA divided by revenue for that period;

    - “CfD Adjusted EBITDA Margin” for the year ended 31 December 2016 as CfD Adjusted EBITDA divided by CfD
Adjusted Revenue;

    - “underlying profit after tax” as profit for the year excluding the post-tax effect of unrealised gains and losses on
derivative contracts, asset obsolescence charges and the one-off settlement in connection with the CESP in 2014 as
well as the effect of the deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences in our U.S. business; and

    - “net debt” as current and non-current borrowings and overdrafts (net of deferred finance costs) less short-term
investments, cash and cash equivalents.

We define the following pro forma financial measures as follows:

    - “Pro Forma CfD Adjusted Revenue” as pro forma consolidated Revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016
adjusted to: (i) exclude the support of the RO Scheme from 1 January 2016 in respect of the third biomass-fired
generation unit, and (ii) include the impact of our CfD as if the contract had become effective on 1 January 2016
(including the impact on the value of the ROCs earned by our first and second biomass-fired generation unit);

    - “Pro Forma CfD Adjusted EBITDA” as pro forma consolidated EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2016
adjusted to: (i) exclude the support of the RO Scheme from 1 January 2016 in respect of the third biomass-fired
generation unit, and (ii) include the impact of our CfD as if the contract had become effective on 1 January 2016
(including the impact on the value of the ROCs earned by our first and second biomass-fired generation unit); and

    - “Pro forma consolidated net debt” is defined as pro forma current and non-current borrowings and overdrafts
(excluding deferred finance costs) less pro forma short-term investments and pro forma cash and cash equivalents.

We present a reconciliation of each of the Non-IFRS Measures to the most directly comparable measure calculated and
presented in accordance with IFRS and discuss its limitations. For a reconciliation of these Non-IFRS Measures and such
discussions, refer to “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Drax Group plc—Summary historical
_financial and other information and pro forma consolidated financial information—Other Financial, Pro Forma and As_
_Adjusted Information” and “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Opus Energy Group Limited—_
_Summary historical financial and other information”._


-----

We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our operating
performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly used by
investors. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. For
example, our definition of EBITDA (in respect to the Group) includes certain adjustments which some companies might
include in a definition of “adjusted EBITDA”. Our EBITDA and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements
of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating
performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Our Non-IFRS Measures
have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of
our results of operations as reported under IFRS. In addition, EBITDA may be defined differently from the definition of
“Consolidated EBITDA” under the Indenture. Some limitations of EBITDA-based measures include:

    - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on
our debt;

    - they do not reflect any cash income and certain other taxes that we may be required to pay;

    - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; and

    - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative
of our ongoing operations.

Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash
available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our
obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS
Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate our performance.

Key performance indicators and the other non-financial operational data included in this Offering Memorandum are not
part of our financial statements and have not been audited. Our use or computation of these indicators may not be comparable
with the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. None of the key performance
indicators or other non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum should be considered in isolation or
as an alternative to any indicator of our operating performance, cash flows or other measure of performance derived in
accordance with IFRS.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or
thousands and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments, and, as a result, the totals of
the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages
and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of_ _Drax” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of_
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Opus” are calculated using the numerical data in the Drax Group Audited_
Financial Statements, the Opus Group Audited Financial Statements and the Opus Group Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements (contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum) or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to
rounding) contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative
description thereof.


-----

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

In this Offering Memorandum, reference is made to information regarding our business and the market and industry in
which we operate and compete. The market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used in this Offering
Memorandum were obtained from governmental and other publicly available information, independent industry publications
and reports prepared by industry consultants. Market data and forecasts are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty
and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such market data and forecasts are based on market research,
which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments
about what type of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. While the Issuer and the Guarantors
accept responsibility for accurately extracting, reproducing and summarising this market and industry data, neither the Issuer
nor the Guarantors accept any further responsibility in respect of such information. Industry publications and forecasts
generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy
and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. Management has not independently verified such data and cannot
guarantee their accuracy or completeness.

In addition to the foregoing, certain information regarding markets, market size, market share, market position, growth
rates and other industry data pertaining to us contained in this Offering Memorandum were based on estimates prepared by
management based on certain assumptions and management’s knowledge of the industry in which the we operate. In many
cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other
organisations) to validate market-related analyses and estimates, requiring us to rely on our own internally developed
estimates regarding the energy industry, our position in the industry, our market share and the market shares of various
industry participants based on management’s experience, management’s own investigation of market conditions and
management’s review of industry publications, including information made available to the public by our competitors. For
example, our assertions that we produced 16 per cent. of the UK’s total renewable electricity in 2015 at approximately 10 per
cent. of the overall renewable energy cost are based upon a combination of management estimates and information on the
cost of and generation under the Levy Control Framework available from DBEIS. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can
assure you of the accuracy and completeness of, or take responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while management believes
its internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and neither we nor
the Initial Purchasers can assure you as to their accuracy or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such
data. Our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors.

In this Offering Memorandum, certain of the references to our competitors, customers or other companies are made by
using their trade names and not their full legal names.

compliance period, we are also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable energy. We provide flexible and reliable
generation and produced 65 per cent. of our electricity for the year ended 31 December 2016 from sustainable biomass,
making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy. Our three 645MW biomass-fired generation units receive
regulatory support, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable revenue. Our
biomass-fired generation assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass supply chain comprising dedicated port
handling infrastructure and rail paths, thereby enhancing security of supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities.
Our three 645MW capacity coal-fired generation units provide important support services to the UK’s electricity system,
including greater reliability and flexibility at times of low De-rated Reserve Margins and system stress. In response to the
growth in inflexible, intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid, we recently acquired four rapid-response Open
Cycle Gas Turbine (“OCGT”) development projects with the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK
electricity system and diversify our future energy generation capability.

Taken together, Haven Power and the Opus Group (our Retail segment) were, as of 31 October 2016, the fifth largest
supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume. Haven Power and the Opus Group provide us with a direct route
into the retail market for much of the electricity we generate. We believe counterparties to retail sales place fewer credit
restrictions on us than wholesale market counterparties and selling to the retail market provides us with a more diversified
counterparty base with less overall counterparty credit risk.

We produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources in two plants in the southern United States and use
those pellets as fuel for our biomass-fired generation. We have recently announced our successful bid to acquire a third wood
pellet manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which we expect to complete by the end of April 2017. We expect the acquisition
to significantly increase our production capacity during 2018. We have also entered into long-term contracts with wood pellet
suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass.

Drax Group plc is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange under stock ticker “DRX”, and is part of
the FTSE 250 Index. Drax Group plc’s market capitalisation as at 13 April 2017 was approximately £1,290 million. Our pro
_forma consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2016 was £507.6 million._

The three segments of our business are:

    - Generation: Through our Generation segment, we play a significant role in providing reliable renewable baseload
electricity generation capacity, enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s
transition to a low-carbon future. In 2016, we generated approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s electricity needs (of
which approximately 65 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass) from the Power Station, located near
Selby, Yorkshire. In 2015 our sustainable biomass-fired generation units produced approximately 16 per cent. of the
UK’s renewable electricity at approximately 10 per cent. of the cost to consumers.


-----

Our three biomass-fired generation units qualify for attractive regulatory support via the Contracts for Difference
(“CfD”) and Renewables Obligation (“RO”) regimes which provide the Power Station with financial support to
facilitate the production of baseload electricity. The six generation units at the Power Station are the largest in their
class in the UK, with an output capacity of up to 645MW each, compared with the typical coal-fired thermal
generation unit size for larger power stations in the UK of approximately 500MW. Each of the generation units is
operated independently and has the flexibility to generate electricity between 200MW and 645MW. We have
identified a growing need for system support services and have signed and renewed a number of contracts with the
System Operator to supply Ancillary Services systems support. Furthermore, we recently acquired four rapidresponse OCGT generation projects across England and Wales which, if and when developed, we expect will
benefit from the stable earnings afforded by capacity market agreements.

    - Retail: We supply electricity to businesses through Haven Power (Supplier of the Year at the 2016 Energy Awards)
and electricity and gas to businesses through Opus Energy Group Limited and its subsidiaries, (together, the “Opus
**Group”), which we acquired in February 2017. Both Haven Power and the Opus Group provide us with a credit-**
efficient route to market for a proportion of the electricity we generate and the Renewables Obligation Certificates
(“ROCs”) that our Generation segment earns. The majority of Haven Power’s sales volumes are with larger
industrial and commercial (“I&C”) customers such as Manchester Airport Group and Thames Water, while the
Opus Group is focused on small and medium sized enterprises (“SME”). Taken together, Haven Power and the
Opus Group were, as of 31 October 2016, the fifth largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume.
We expect the Opus Group, a leading challenger brand to the Big Six in the SME market, to enhance and broaden
our retail offering in the SME market with a wider product range than we previously offered, including, for
example, gas. We also own Billington Bioenergy, a biomass pellet supplier to businesses and households.

    - Biomass Supply: Through our Biomass Supply segment based in the southern U.S. we manufacture and supply
compressed wood pellets from sustainably managed forests. We take low-grade wood and residues from other wood
processing industries and transform them into pellets that can be transported around the world to supply low-carbon
energy. We operate two wood pellet manufacturing facilities in Bastrop, Louisiana and Gloster, Mississippi, both of
which are certified under the Sustainable Biomass Program, an industry standard, demonstrating that biomass is
legally and sustainably sourced. Our manufacturing facilities have a combined annual capacity of 900,000 tonnes,
which we expect to increase through planned expansion to 1,050,000 tonnes by the end of 2017. In addition,
following the acquisition of a third wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana (which we
expect will complete by the end of April 2017), we expect to increase our combined annual capacity by a further
450,000 tonnes during 2018. In 2016, our total biomass production was approximately 607,000 tonnes. We operate
a port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which includes two 40,000 tonne storage domes to transport pellets from
our own manufacturing facilities and from approved third-party suppliers to the UK for use by our Generation
segment. The port facility can load more than 15,000 tonnes of pellets per day and can accommodate Panamax
Vessels.

**Strengths**

**_We are an important part of the UK’s energy infrastructure._**

We are a major provider of electricity in the UK, supplying approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s requirements in
2016. We generated approximately 16 per cent. of the UK’s renewable energy in 2015. Based on the 2015-2016 compliance
period, we are also the largest single-site UK renewable energy generator through our biomass-fired generation units. As a
vertically-integrated business active in each of the sourcing, electricity generation and supply businesses, we are a significant
participant in the overall UK energy landscape.

Our primary generation facility, the Power Station, is the largest power station in the UK by generation capacity, with
approximately 4GW of installed capacity. The Power Station has six generation units, three generating electricity from
sustainable biomass and three from coal, meaning that we are not dependent on a single fuel source. These units each have an
output capacity of up to 645MW, compared to a typical coal-fired thermal generation unit size of approximately 500MW in
the UK, and are the most efficient units in their class in the UK, enabling them to run profitably at times when others cannot.
Each of the generation units can be operated independently to provide baseload electricity and has the flexibility to generate
between 200MW and 645MW, enabling them to provide a range of generation and system support services to the electricity
network.

During the last decade, the UK energy market has changed significantly due to the increase in inflexible, renewable
generation technology and the closure of significant volumes of thermal plants. De-rated Reserve Margins are significantly
lower now than they were ten years ago. As a result, there is a need for generation assets in the UK which can generate at any
point in time and which can alter their generation profiles to support the changing levels of intermittent generation. The
flexible, responsive and reliable characteristics of our coal-fired and biomass-fired generation units allow us to meet this need
and play an important role in the UK’s security of supply.


-----

**_Our earnings benefit from a high degree of stability and visibility._**

Our earnings have a high degree of stability as a result of:

    - the support for our three biomass-fired generation units under the RO Scheme and CfD Regime;

    - opportunities for Ancillary Services revenues;

    - Capacity Market payments for two of our coal-fired generation units;

    - long-term fixed price formula biomass contracts;

    - retail margins; and

    - a strong hedging policy.

Based on our past performance, we expect our gross margin to be derived predominantly from non-commodity exposed
sources of earnings in the future. As a consequence of this, the volatility of our earnings which characterised the cash flows
in previous years should be substantially reduced.

_Biomass-fired generation_

Generation from the Power Station’s existing biomass generation units benefits from a UK legislative and contractual
framework designed to support renewable energy sources. Our recently converted third biomass-fired generation unit
receives support through the CfD Regime, while our other two biomass-fired generation units are supported under the RO
Scheme. As a renewable fuel, biomass is exempt from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support.

Our CfD is a private law contract between Drax Power and a government-owned entity, the Low Carbon Contracts
Company Limited. Under our CfD we are paid any shortfall, and repay any excess, between a strike price and a market
reference price calculated as the average market price for electricity in the UK market over a given period. Our CfD is
indexed to UK consumer price inflation and extends to March 2027. It provides an effective hedge against the electricity
price at current market prices and thereby supports earnings stability and visibility for our business.

The RO Scheme, established in 2002 to encourage the development of large-scale renewable electricity capacity in the
UK, places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers either to source a proportion of the electricity they provide to
customers from eligible renewable sources or to make a buy-out payment. The sourcing of renewable energy is demonstrated
by the supplier presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to the administrator of the RO
Scheme, Ofgem. ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh of renewable electricity generated in
different proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity suppliers can source ROCs from renewable electricity
generators. ROCs are tradable certificates with no fixed price and therefore the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC
is a matter for negotiation between the supplier and generator. However, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial
Strategy (“DBEIS”) sets the level of the obligation of a supplier to source renewable electricity each year using a headroom
calculation which provides a set margin between the predicted generation (supply of ROCs) and the level of the obligation
(demand for ROCs). This aims to reduce the possibility of supply exceeding the obligation in any given year and therefore
provides some stability to the price of ROCs. As a result of the RO Scheme our Generation segment therefore receives ROCs
that, as a vertically-integrated renewable energy generator, we can use in our Retail segment or sell to third parties.

We currently receive one ROC for each MWh of generation from our first two biomass-fired generation units, on top of
the purchase price for the sale of electricity produced. ROC support for these two units extends until March 2027 and through
this period is grandfathered by the Government at the level of one ROC for each MWh of generation. The buy-out price for
ROCs includes an element of inflation indexation. A proportion of the underlying electricity that these two units produce is
sold on a forward basis in order to improve the stability and visibility of our cash flows.

_Ancillary Services_

The System Operator is required to balance supply and demand and to ensure the secure and stable operation of the
transmission system. It routinely contracts with generators to provide specific contracts for Ancillary Services, including
adjusting electricity generation to balance the system. We are able to provide Ancillary Services to the System Operator such
as frequency response (altering output to ensure the frequency of electricity on the grid is within statutory limits) and
“reactive power” services (enabling the System Operator to manage the voltage profile of the transmission system within
certain parameters). Only a limited number of generators can provide some of these services in Great Britain, and we expect
this number of generators to reduce over time as further thermal plants close. As Great Britain transitions to greater, more
intermittent low carbon generation, the revenue that we receive from Ancillary Services is expected to be increasingly
important. We believe that the large, flexible characteristics of the generating assets we operate are well suited to offer these
services, providing an opportunity for further contract-based revenues.


-----

_Capacity Market Agreements_

The UK has established a Capacity Market system to support security and reliability of supply for the end consumer.
The Capacity Market guarantees selected generators a fixed price for maintaining a specified generation capacity for a given
period of time through an auction system. Generators receive either a one-year capacity market agreement or 15-year
capacity market agreement depending on whether they are entering the auction for existing or potential new plants,
respectively. Existing plant requiring significant refurbishment may also be eligible for three-year capacity market
agreements.

All of our generation units which do not currently benefit from support under the RO Scheme or CfD Regime are
currently eligible to participate in Capacity Market auctions for one-year capacity market agreements. We currently have
capacity market agreements for two coal units and the three small gas turbines located at the Power Station, which are
expected to result in contract-based revenues in excess of £80 million between 2017 and 2021 in the aggregate.

_Retail_

The Opus Acquisition added an established and profitable energy supplier in the SME market to our Group, in addition
to our Haven Power business. Opus enjoys industry leading customer retention levels and the potential for further growth, for
example by allowing our Group to provide a dual fuel offering for the first time, while Haven Power is well established in the
I&C market and is seeking to increase its number of SME customers. The Opus Group increases our presence in the SME
market which is characterised by higher gross margins per MWh compared to the I&C market. Haven Power and the Opus
Group provide a direct route into the market for a significant amount of the electricity we generate and a significant
proportion of the ROCs issued to us.

_Hedging policy_

The earnings of our Generation segment are further supported by our strong hedging policy under which we sell
electricity generated by the Power Station up to two years ahead. This allows us to secure a margin on such electricity at
times when bark spreads or dark green spreads are attractive, thereby increasing visibility with respect to our future
Generation segment earnings. For example, as of February 2017, we had forward-sold approximately 17.8 TWh and 7.0 TWh
of electricity for delivery in the 2017 and 2018, respectively.

**_We enjoy relatively low levels of volatility in our fuel input costs through active management of our supply chain._**

We actively manage our biomass supply chain to enhance security of supply and support sufficient sourcing of wood
pellet volumes to generate electricity. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities have a combined annual capacity of 900,000
tonnes, which we expect to increase through planned expansion to 1,050,000 tonnes by the end of 2017. In addition,
following the acquisition of a third wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana (which we expect will
complete by the end of April 2017), we expect to increase our combined annual capacity by a further 450,000 tonnes during
2018. Our first two facilities continue to play a growing role in the sourcing of our feedstock and our new facility is expected
to do the same. We also operate a U.S. port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with an annual export capacity at 2,100,000
tonnes (with the scope to expand further to 3,000,000 tonnes), in excess of our current self-supply, allowing us to consolidate
supply from third-parties to drive further supply chain efficiencies.

Our Biomass Supply segment manufactures compressed wood pellets, from sustainably sourced feedstock, for use as a
low carbon, renewable fuel in our biomass-fired generation units. The U.S. operations are strategically positioned near one
another to optimise the time and cost of wood pellet deliveries to ports.

In 2016, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities shipped approximately 560,000 tonnes of wood pellets to the Power
Station, with the balance currently being sourced from third-party suppliers based in North America and Europe under a
series of predominantly long-term contracts from sources also certified as sustainable. We aim to increase the share of
internally sourced pellets to at least 30 per cent. in the future.

Our ability to source an increasing proportion of our biomass requirements internally via self-supply allows us to better
manage the quality of feedstock and the timing of deliveries. This self-supply enables us to optimise generation and reduce
the risk of fuel shortages and supply chain issues curtailing generation from the Power Station and to better ensure a stable
cost of biomass, thus reducing exposure to commodity price fluctuations. At the same time, we maintain the flexibility to
participate in the biomass spot market when biomass prices are attractive.

Our exposure to commodity prices is managed through a commercial hedging strategy which seeks to enter into
forward sales of electricity and purchases of associated fuel and the carbon emissions allowances. Additionally, to manage
the currency risks associated with our biomass purchase contracts, which are mainly in U.S. dollars, we actively hedge our
position and have put in place a rolling five-year hedging strategy to that effect.

Due to the conversion of three of our coal-fired generation units to biomass and our expected lower need for coal in the
future, we have reduced the level of coal stocks held on-site, and intend to further reduce such stocks over time.


-----

**_We operate the most efficient coal/biomass-fired power station in its class in the UK._**

The Power Station’s biomass-fired and coal-fired generation units are the most efficient in their class in the UK, based
on the proportion of the energy content of the fuel that is ultimately converted into electricity. Our conversion of three coalfired generation units to biomass demonstrates our technological capabilities while proving our ability to take action in light
of changes in the regulatory framework.

The changes in the UK regulatory environment over the past decade provided a catalyst to upgrade our generation
assets by converting three of our six electricity generation units to biomass and improving our remaining coal-fired
generation units to make them more efficient and to reduce operating costs. We continue to invest regularly in our asset base
to ensure that the Power Station maintains a high level of fuel efficiency.

Following the third successful conversion of one of our coal-fired generation units to biomass in 2016, we are now the
UK’s largest single-site renewable generator based on capacity. We have been able to achieve this without compromising our
ability to operate each unit independently, and we remain flexible to ensure we can continue to provide the essential services
required by the System Operator and can maximise the value of our generation business.

We operate a “safety first” business, and emphasise the health, safety and welfare of our employees and contractors, as
part of our vision in delivering operational excellence across the Group. Each business unit and corporate team has local
arrangements in place, reflecting the operating environment and hazards inherent in the various workplaces, to ensure that
high standards are set and maintained. Safety remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are continuing to
work to improve our performance across the Group.

**_Strong financial metrics and conservative financial policy_**

We have a conservative financial policy and have maintained a low leverage since we listed on the London Stock
Exchange in December 2005.

Over the last three calendar years, our average net leverage has been 0.7x. After the recent Opus Acquisition for a
consideration of £367 million, our pro forma CfD Adjusted net leverage as at 31 December 2016 only increased to 1.7x. We
are committed to maintaining leverage at a level that is consistent with our current credit rating, which supports our trading
strategy.

We are focussed on targeted selective investments which we expect to help us to continue to diversify our earnings and
cash flows sources within the framework of our conservative financial policy.

Following our decision to adapt the maintenance and upgrade schedule for our remaining coal-fired generation units to
reflect lower expected output and the anticipated end of electricity generation from coal by 2025, we expect our annual
maintenance capital expenditures to decrease to levels substantially lower than those seen during the previous two years. We
expect our future maintenance capital expenditures to primarily consist of investments to upgrade our facilities to, among
other things, comply with applicable regulatory regimes, which we expect to translate into greater operating cash flow going
forward.

**_We have a pioneering management team with proven experience in leading a successful business transformation._**

Our management team has proven its ability to lead our business through an evolving regulatory and commodity
market environment. We have successfully transformed what was initially a pure coal generation business into a verticallyintegrated generator and supplier of predominantly renewable electricity and now have industry-leading experience and
knowledge with respect to biomass and its related supply chain logistics.

Our management team is complemented by a skilled operating team who are at the forefront of biomass conversion
technology, including the mechanical, engineering, electrical and civil works required for conversion. We believe the
conversion of three of our generation units to biomass remains Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and was delivered on
budget.

Our operational experience in handling biomass is also market-leading. We have developed innovative fuel-handling
systems, logistics and storage solutions for biomass fuel as well as a bespoke technically-advanced covered rail wagon with a
specialised door design and a patented product flow control system to manage biomass during discharge.

As a result of the conversion project, we have developed an in-depth understanding of the scientific and technological
effects of burning a range of biomass fuels, as well as of the critical combustion characteristics of such fuels.

We have also put in place a biomass sustainability policy, which includes comprehensive carbon foot-printing across
our biomass supply chain and regular independent supplier audits. All of our biomass is procured in accordance with this
sustainability policy.


-----

**Strategy**

Our strategy is to deliver a stronger, more predictable, long-term financial performance for the Group along with
greater diversification in the markets in which we operate. By doing so, we seek to continue to play an important role in the
way energy is generated, supplied and used as the UK moves to a low carbon future.

**_Maintain stable earnings visibility by focusing on contractual revenue streams_**

In the Generation segment, we plan to significantly further improve the visibility of future earnings and cash flows by
increasing the proportion of our contracted earnings through Ancillary Services and Capacity Market payments. We expect
this, combined with the support we receive under the CfD Regime and ROC Scheme, will result in a reduced level of
commodity markets exposure and increased stability and visibility of earnings.

The Ancillary Services market is an important market for us. The flexible, dispatchable and responsive nature of our
generation assets positions us well to compete in the market. With the changing grid dynamic, this market could grow
significantly.

Separately, we have secured capacity market agreements worth in excess of £80 million between 2017 and 2021 in the
aggregate. Both types of agreement ensure system stability and provide us with revenue streams independent of electricity
price fluctuations.

We believe that more rapid response power plants will be required to keep the UK’s electricity system stable in the
future. If we can secure attractive 15-year capacity market agreements to provide the base revenues required, we intend to
address this increased need for flexible electricity by developing the four recently acquired 299MW OCGT projects, while
simultaneously diversifying our generating capacity. Subject to completion of construction of these OCGT plants and their
ability to secure capacity market agreements, two of these plants could be generating electricity as early as 2020/21, and the
other two by 2023/24, which would, in total, add the potential for more than approximately 1.2GW of rapid response OCGT
generation into our generation portfolio.

We also stand ready to convert more of our coal-fired generation units to biomass subject to appropriate regulatory
support or economic conditions, and are actively engaged in research and development activities to identify and deliver
opportunities for low-cost biomass generation and supply chain activities.

**_Profitably grow our Retail segment_**

Our objective is to increase the proportion of revenue and earnings generated by our Retail segment by increasingly
focusing on the higher-margin SME market and by evaluating options for further margin enhancement, such as product
alternatives and efficiency enhancement. We expect the Opus Acquisition to further enhance and broaden our retail offering
with a wider product range, including gas. Our efforts to integrate the Opus Group with the operations of our existing
supplier Haven Power are fully underway. To improve profitability, we are in the process of replacing the Opus Group’s
third-party supply arrangements with less expensive internal arrangements.

The Opus Group’s expertise in SME electricity and gas sales, combined with Haven Power’s track record in the I&C
market and our generation capacity and commodity risk management expertise provide us with a strong platform for growth
in the Retail segment. We believe the knowledge, resources and platforms shared by the combined business across both the
I&C and the SME markets will enable us to deliver new products and services and enhanced market coverage to drive market
share growth.

**_Expand wood pellet self-supply through targeted investments and acquisitions_**

We intend to supply the Power Station with at least 30 per cent. of its annual demand for wood pellets from our own
production in the future. To achieve this goal, we will consider targeted acquisitions if we can identify attractive
opportunities, including the potential acquisition of financially distressed pellet plants in the U.S. In addition to our expected
acquisition of our third wood pellet manufacturing facility in Urania, Louisiana, we intend to participate in an auction to
purchase a wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Woodville, Texas. We have also identified the opportunity to make
incremental capital investment in our existing U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities to increase capacity, allowing a
greater utilisation of the lowest cost residue material, helping to reduce the overall cost of biomass, at an estimated capital
cost of approximately US$15 million. We intend to deliver the increased 150,000 tonnes of capacity by the end of 2017. We
further intend to optimise supply chain and logistics operations for our Generation segment, and to utilise the flexibility of
self-supply to manage production, to allow it to benefit from attractively priced biomass cargoes in the spot market. We are
also exploring opportunities to pursue third-party supply contracts with respect to the wood pellets produced by our Biomass
Supply segment to further enhance the flexibility and value in our supply chain.


-----

**_Continue to focus on operational excellence_**

We continue to work at improving our performance across all segments, and are a consistent top quartile performer for
safety performance. Having established ourselves as a leader in managing sustainable biomass based electricity generation
across the entire value chain, we aim to leverage this expertise to continue developing our business.

We are focused on improving the operational gains from our wood pellet manufacturing facilities, responding to
planned and unplanned events at the Power Station through seamless teamwork to maintain high availability and ensure an
excellent standard of customer service at our Retail segment. Safety and sustainability remain at the centre of our operational
philosophy, recognising that excellent safety performance at the Power Station and our biomass plants drives efficiency and
improves the productivity of our assets. All of our biomass is procured in line with our industry leading sustainability criteria
ensuring that the wood pellets we use for electricity generation are sustainable and low carbon.

**Recent Developments**

In April 2017, we announced our successful bid to acquire the assets of Louisiana Pellets. Louisiana Pellets is the
owner and developer of a wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana. The auction price was
US$35.4 million. A court hearing approving the auction result was held on 4 April 2017 and completion of the sale is
expected to by the end of April 2017.

**The Issuer**

The Issuer has been newly incorporated in England and Wales with company number 10664639 for the purposes of
issuing the Notes and lending the proceeds on to the DGHL Group. It is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of DGHL, and an

of the Opus Group at that date) were £3,443.0 million (excluding goodwill), representing 100 per cent. of the Group’s total assets excluding goodwill of £14.5
million as of that date. As of 31 December 2016, the total assets of the Guarantors that were members of the Opus Group at that date were £179 million
(calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding intra-group items, goodwill and investments in subsidiaries of Opus), representing 100 per cent. of the
Opus Group’s total assets excluding goodwill as of 31 December 2016.

As of 31 December 2016, after giving pro forma effect to the Opus Acquisition and the Refinancing, DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have had
£597.1 million of borrowings outstanding, of which £550.0 million is represented by the Notes.

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Guarantees will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral,
as set out under “Description of Notes—Security”.

(3) Certain Restricted Subsidiaries will be subject to the restrictive covenants under the Indenture as at the Issue Date, but will not guarantee the Notes or provide
any security in respect of the Notes.

As of 31 December 2016, on a pro forma basis for the Opus Acquisition and the Refinancing, such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have had no outstanding
third-party indebtedness.

(4) On or about the Issue Date, we will amend and restate a revolving credit facility agreement originally entered into on 20 December 2012, as amended and
restated on 8 December 2015, between, among others, Drax Power Limited (“Drax **Power”), Barclays Bank PLC as facility agent and Drax Corporate Limited**
and its subsidiaries as guarantors, pursuant to an amendment and restatement agreement (the “New Senior Facilities Agreement”). The New Senior Facilities
Agreement will comprise a £315 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility and a drawn £35 million term facility (the “New Senior
**Facilities”). The original borrower under the New Senior Facilities Agreement is Drax Corporate Limited. The New Senior Facilities will be guaranteed by the**
Guarantors and will be secured by the same Collateral as for the Notes. In the event of enforcement or certain distressed disposals, any liabilities in respect of
obligations under the New Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including under the Secured Trading Line) and liabilities to lenders or creditors
under certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) will receive priority in relation to any
proceeds received from the Collateral. Please see “Description of Notes—Security”. For more information on the terms of the New Senior Facilities
Agreement, please see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Facilities Agreement”.

(5) Drax Power has entered into ISDA agreements with a number of financial institutions, including certain financial institutions (the “STL Counterparties”)
with whom Drax Power can trade UK power, dark green spreads and gas on a senior secured basis without the requirement for Drax Power to post collateral
(the “Secured Trading Line”). Under the terms of the New Senior Facilities Agreement, the potential future exposure under the Secured Trading Line for
each combination of tradable products must be less than £200 million, as determined each time Drax Power seeks to add an additional season to the Secured
Trading Line. The STL Counterparties will benefit from the same Collateral as the Notes, the New Senior Facilities. In the event of enforcement or certain
distressed disposals, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the New Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including under the Secured
Trading Line and the currency, interest rate and inflation hedging referred to below) and liabilities to lenders or creditors under certain other indebtedness
permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) will receive priority in relation to any proceeds of certain distressed
disposals or enforcement of the Collateral. Please see “Description of Notes—Security”. In addition, Drax Power has the ability to enter into currency, interest
rate and inflation rate hedging arrangements on a senior secured basis, with such counterparties also benefiting from the same Collateral as referred to above.
Such hedging arrangements may, in the future, also be entered into by other members of the Group. These arrangements are in addition to any commodities
and/or currency and interest rate trading that the Group undertakes on an unsecured basis. For more information on the terms of these arrangements, please see
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Secured Trading Line and Hedging”.

(6) Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement to be entered into on or about the Issue Date, in the event of an enforcement of the security interests over the
Collateral and certain distressed disposals, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the lenders under the New Senior
Facilities Agreement, counterparties to certain hedging agreements (including under the Secured Trading Line) and lenders or creditors under certain other
indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) have been repaid in full. For more information on the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, please see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

(7) On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will lend the gross proceeds of the Offering to Drax Corporate Limited pursuant to the Proceeds Loans. Those proceeds
will then be applied as described in “Use of Proceeds”.

_Guarantees—Releases of Notes Guarantees”._

As of 31 December 2016, on an as adjusted basis giving effect to the
Refinancing as described under “— _The Refinancing” and “Use of Proceeds”_
DGHL’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes would have had no
outstanding third-party indebtedness.

The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency

_Note Guarantees”._

**Ranking of the Guarantees** Each Guarantee of the Notes will be a general, joint and several, senior
obligation of the respective Guarantor and will:

                               - rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future

                                - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future
obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee;

                               - be secured by the Collateral as set forth under “Description of

(subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) have been repaid in full;

of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that are not also Guarantors;
and

                               - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations
of such Guarantor that are secured by property or assets that do
not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such obligations.

The Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will also secure the
New Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including the

obligations in respect of the Guarantees may be released in certain
circumstances. In addition, the security interests in the Collateral may be

_Notes, the Guarantees, and Our Capital Structure”, “Description of Certain_

benefits of the holders of the Notes will be limited accordingly and subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

**Optional Redemption:**

Fixed Rate Notes The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate Notes at any time on or
after 1 May 2019 at the redemption prices as described under “Description of
_Notes—Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest and_

outstanding after such redemption.

In connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of the Fixed

See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender
_Offers”._

Floating Rate Notes At any time prior to 1 May 2018, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to
time, part of the Floating Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 per

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the Notes obtain and maintain
an investment-grade rating. Each of these covenants is subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of Notes—Certain

register the Notes or the Guarantees under the securities laws in any
jurisdiction (including by way of an exchange offer) and does not intend to do

trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that

to do so and they may discontinue market making at any time without notice.
Accordingly, there can be no assurances as to the development or liquidity of
any market for the Notes.

The Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on 10 March 2017, and is a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of DGHL, which is in turn a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Drax Group plc. The Issuer
was formed solely for the purpose of issuing the Notes. The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and as of the
Issue Date its only material assets will be its rights and claims under intercompany financings (including under the Proceeds
Loans) and its only material liabilities will be its outstanding indebtedness (including its obligations under the Notes and its
guarantees in respect of the New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the Secured Trading

For further information, please see “Summary—Corporate and Financing Structure”, “Our _Business” and “Description of_
_Certain Financing Arrangements”._

Unless otherwise indicated, this Offering Memorandum does not include any historical financial information relating to
the Issuer due to the limited historical financial information available for the Issuer.

This Offering Memorandum presents consolidated financial information for the Group on the level of Drax Group plc,
the immediate holding company of DGHL. Drax Group plc will not be subject to the restrictive covenants under the
Indenture, will not provide a Guarantee in favour of the Notes and will not grant security in favour of the Notes, except with
respect to the shares it owns in DGHL and certain receivables owed to Drax Group plc by members of the Group. Drax
Group plc is a holding company and as at 31 December 2016 its only material assets and liabilities were its interest in the
issued and outstanding shares of DGHL, its rights and obligations under the Shareholder Support Agreement, a net
intercompany liability (including the balance of intercompany liabilities and intercompany receivables) of £6.3 million and
cash of £0.7 million.

The following tables present summary historical consolidated financial data for Drax Group plc as at and for the years
ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016, and summary historical non-statutory consolidated financial data for Opus as at
and for the years ended 31 March 2015 and 2016 and as at and for the nine months ended 31 December 2015 and 2016. The
summary historical consolidated financial data of Drax Group plc as at and for the years ended 31 December 2014, 2015 and
2016 has been derived from the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”).

The summary historical non-statutory consolidated financial data of the Opus Group as at and for the years ended
31 March 2015 and 2016 has been derived from the Opus Group’s Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum and the Opus Group’s Unaudited Interim Financial Statements as at and for the nine months ended
31 December 2015 and 2016 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Opus Group Audited Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Opus Group Unaudited Interim Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS on an interim financial reporting basis (IAS 34).

The following tables also present summary unaudited consolidated pro forma income statement and balance sheet data
for Drax Group plc as at and for the year ended 31 December 2016 to give effect to the Opus Acquisition, the Opus
Acquisition-related financing and the Refinancing. The unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the year
ended 31 December 2016 has been prepared as if the Opus Acquisition and the Refinancing occurred on 1 January 2016. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 has been prepared based on (i) the
historical consolidated financial statements for Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2016; and (ii) the Opus LTM
Financial Information. The Opus LTM Financial Information was derived by adding the non-statutory consolidated income
statement data of the Opus Group for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2016 to the unaudited non-statutory consolidated
income statement data for the nine months ended 31 December 2016 and deducting the unaudited non-statutory income
statement data for the nine months ended 31 December 2015. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this
Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of the Opus Group’s financial reporting, has not been audited
and is not necessarily representative of the Opus Group’s results of operations for any future period. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 is based on the assumption that the Opus Acquisition and the Refinancing
was completed on the balance sheet date.

The summary unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting
in accordance with IFRS, under which the assets and liabilities of the Opus Group will be recorded by Drax Group plc at
their respective fair values as at the date the Opus Acquisition was completed. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and
based on estimates of the fair value and useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and have been prepared to
illustrate the estimated effect of the Opus Acquisition. The excess purchase consideration over the carrying amount has been
attributed to goodwill and other intangibles. The fair value adjustments may be material. Pro forma adjustments reflected in
the pro forma financial information are based on items that are factually supportable and directly attributable to the Opus
Acquisition, the Opus Acquisition-related financing and the Refinancing. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial information is provided for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual results of

operations of Drax Group plc would have been had the Opus Acquisition and the Refinancing occurred on the respective
dates assumed, nor is it indicative of the future results of the consolidated company. See “Unaudited Pro Forma

performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. We
present CfD Adjusted Revenue for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the revenue we would have achieved had our CfD become
effective on 1 January 2016 or a projection of future revenue. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the results of operations and should not be

(a) Represents the estimated benefit from the ROCs earned by our third generation unit converted to biomass during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Until 19 December 2016, our third biomass-fired generation unit was operated as an enhanced co-firing unit earning ROCs for the proportion of
electricity generated from sustainable biomass. The ROC adjustment has been calculated as the sum of (i) the number of ROCs earned from the
generation of renewable electricity from our third biomass-fired generation unit during the year 2016 multiplied by an assumed price that we estimate
could have been achieved by selling such ROCs to third parties and (ii) the number of ROCs earned from the generation of renewable electricity from
our third biomass-fired generation unit during the year 2016 multiplied by the ROC recycle payment for each ROC in the relevant compliance period.
The assumed price for each ROC has been derived by applying a discount to the buy-out value of each such ROC, which is consistent with historical
discounts to the buy-out price achieved by us when selling ROCs to third parties. The ROC adjustment is based on estimates and assumptions our
management believes to be reasonable and is therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual benefits of the ROCs earned as recorded
in the Drax Group Financial Statements differ from the estimate presented herein. Such differences may be material. The Drax Group Audited
Financial Statements and the unaudited pro forma financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum do not reflect the ROC
adjustment and such information has not been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm.

(b) Represents the estimated impact of our CfD on the ROC recycle payment in respect of the ROCs earned by our first and second biomass-fired
generation units based on a recycle payment of £nil per ROC for ROCs earned during the twelve-month period ended 31 March 2016 and £5.35 per
ROC for ROCs earned during the twelve-month period ended 31 March 2017. Based on the assumptions underlying the valuation of the ROCs in the
Drax Group Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, the ROC recycle adjustment would be £3.0 million lower. This
difference will be included in our results of operations for the year ending 31 December 2017. Generation units benefiting from support under the CfD
Regime are not eligible for support under the RO Scheme. Had our CfD for our third biomass fired generation unit become effective on 1 January
2016, the number of ROCs in the relevant compliance periods would therefore have been lower, resulting in each ROC earned by our first and second
biomass-fired generation units being entitled to a proportionally higher share of the ROC buy-out fund (to the extent there was a ROC shortfall in the
relevant compliance period). In addition, and to the extent there was a ROC shortfall in the relevant compliance period, such shortfall would have been
higher, had our CfD for our third biomass-fired generation unit become effective on 1 January 2016. This would have resulted in additional buy-out
payments being made into the buy-out fund, which would in turn have resulted in higher recycle payments in respect of the ROCs earned by our first
and second biomass-fired generation unit. The ROC recycle adjustment is based on estimates and assumptions our management believes to be
reasonable and is therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual impact on the recycle payments for the ROCs earned from our first
and second biomass-fired generation units as recorded in the Drax Group Financial Statements differs from the estimates presented herein. Such
differences may be material. The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements and the unaudited pro forma financial information included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum do not reflect the ROC adjustment and such information has not been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent
accounting firm.

(c) Represents the estimated impact of our CfD as if the contract had become effective on 1 January 2016. The impact of our CfD has been calculated by
multiplying the electricity output of our third biomass-fired generation unit (in MWh) during the year ended 31 December 2016 by the difference
between (i) the strike price under our CfD for such generation unit and (ii) the applicable reference price. The strike price is provided for in our CfD
and is adjusted annually. The reference price reflects average wholesale electricity prices over a certain period and is determined monthly by the
LCCC. For purposes of determining our CfD impact, no adjustment to the cost of fuel has been made because we estimate that the difference in the
cost of fuel per MWh between a co-firing generation unit and a biomass-fired generation unit are immaterial. The calculation of the impact of our CfD
is based on estimates and assumptions our management believes to be reasonable; the actual impact of our CfD may differ from the estimate presented
herein and is therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The impact of our CfD presented herein may not be representative of our future
revenues and earnings. The impact of our CfD on our future revenues and earnings is dependent on a number of factors, including wholesale electricity
prices and availability of the generation unit benefiting from our CfD. The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements and the unaudited pro forma
financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum do not reflect the impact of our CfD and such information has not been
audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm.

(2) We define EBITDA as profit before interest, tax, depreciation (including asset obsolescence charges and losses on disposal), amortisation, unrealised gains and
losses on derivative contracts and the one-off CESP settlement in 2014. CfD Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted to: (i) exclude the support of the
RO Scheme from 1 January 2016 in respect of the relevant unit and (ii) include the impact of our CfD as if the contract had become effective on 1 January
2016. EBITDA and CfD Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to profit
or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. We present EBITDA and CfD Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only. This
information does not represent the profit we would have achieved had our CfD become effective on 1 January 2016 or a projection of future EBITDA. It may
not give an accurate or complete picture of the results of operations and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. See “Presentation of
_Financial Information and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for more information. EBITDA is affected by a number of factors, including_
availability of our generation units, electricity wholesale prices, seasonality and the level of our operating expense. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Drax—Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations” and “Management’s Discussion_
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Opus—Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations” for a description of certain_
significant factors that are expected to have an impact on our EBITDA going forward.

(d) Represents the estimated benefit from the ROCs earned by our third generation unit converted to biomass during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Until 19 December 2016, our third biomass-fired generation unit was operated as an enhanced co-firing unit earning ROCs for the proportion of
electricity generated from sustainable biomass. The ROC adjustment has been calculated as the sum of (i) the number of ROCs earned from the
generation of renewable electricity from our third biomass-fired generation unit during the year 2016 multiplied by an assumed price that we estimate
could have been achieved by selling such ROCs to third parties and (ii) the number of ROCs earned from the generation of renewable electricity from
our third biomass-fired generation unit during the year 2016 multiplied by the ROC recycle payment for each ROC in the relevant compliance period.
The assumed price for each ROC has been derived by applying a discount to the buy-out value of each such ROC, which is consistent with historical
discounts to the buy-out price achieved by us when selling ROCs to third parties. The ROC adjustment is based on estimates and assumptions our
management believes to be reasonable and is therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual benefits of the ROCs earned as recorded
in the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements differ from the estimate presented herein. Such differences may be material. The Drax Group Audited
Financial Statements and the unaudited pro forma financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum do not reflect the ROC
adjustment and such information has not been audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm.

(e) Represents the estimated benefit of our CfD on the ROC recycle payment in respect of the ROCs earned by our first and second biomass-fired
generation units based on a recycle payment of £nil per ROC for ROCs earned during the twelve-month period ended 31 March 2016 and £5.35 per
ROC for ROCs earned during the twelve-month period ended 31 March 2017. Based on the assumptions underlying the valuation of the ROCs in the
Drax Group Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, the ROC recycle adjustment would be £3.0 million lower. Generation
units benefiting from support under the CfD Regime are not eligible for support under the RO Scheme. Had our CfD for our third biomass fired
generation unit become effective on 1 January 2016, the number of ROCs in the relevant compliance periods would therefore have been lower,
resulting in each ROC earned by our first and second biomass-fired generation units being entitled to a proportionally higher share of the ROC buy-out
fund (to the extent there was a ROC shortfall in the relevant compliance period). In addition, and to the extent there was a ROC shortfall in the relevant
compliance period, such shortfall would have been higher had our CfD for our third biomass-fired generation unit become effective on 1 January 2016.
This would have resulted in additional buy-out payments being made into the buy-out fund, which would in turn have resulted in higher recycle
payments in respect of the ROCs earned by our first and second biomass-fired generation unit. The ROC recycle adjustment is based on estimates and
assumptions our management believes to be reasonable and is therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual impact on the recycle
payments for the ROCs earned from our first and second biomass-fired generation units as recorded in the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements
differs from the estimates presented herein. Such differences may be material. The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements and the unaudited pro
forma financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum do not reflect the ROC adjustment and such information has not been
audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm.

(f) Represents the estimated impact of our CfD as if the contract had become effective on 1 January 2016. The impact of our CfD has been calculated by
multiplying the electricity output of our third biomass-fired generation unit (in MWh) during the year ended 31 December 2016 by the difference
between (i) the strike price under our CfD for such generation unit and (ii) the applicable reference price. The strike price is provided for in our CfD
and is adjusted annually. The reference price reflects average wholesale electricity prices over a certain period and is determined monthly by LCCC.
For purposes of determining our CfD impact, no adjustment to the cost of fuel has been made because we estimate that the difference in the cost of fuel
per MWh between a co-firing generation unit and a biomass-fired generation unit are immaterial. The calculation of the impact of our CfD is based on
estimates and assumptions our management believes to be reasonable. The actual impact of our CfD may differ from the estimate presented herein and
is therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The impact of our CfD presented herein may not be representative of our future revenues and

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other_
_information contained in this Offering Memorandum before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks could_
_materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and as a result you may lose all or part_
_of your original investment. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties_
_not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition or results of operations which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to pay_
_interest and repay the principal amount in respect of the Notes._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,_
_including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_The Government initiated a public consultation regarding approaches to put into effect the closure of unabated coal_**
**_power stations by 2025. If the Government implements this proposal, we will have to cease generation of electricity from_**
**_our coal-fired units by 2025._**

In November 2016, the Government initiated a public consultation seeking stakeholder feedback on its proposal to put
an end to unabated electricity generation from coal by 2025. If electricity generation from coal-fired generation units were to
be banned, we would be forced to cease electricity generation from the three coal-fired generation units at the Power Station
by 2025 unless these are upgraded to run on biomass or an alternative fuel or else converted to meet the operating
requirements imposed by relevant regulatory requirements (e.g. addition of abatement equipment or carbon capture and
storage capabilities). As a result, we have decided to accelerate the depreciation of the coal-specific assets in the Power
Station but not the coal-fired generation units to 2025 and expect that this decision will increase our depreciation charge by
approximately £27 million per annum starting in 2017. If we were forced to cease electricity generation from the coal-fired
generation units, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_The reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other relevant_**
**_changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

The development of renewable energy sources, including biomass and the generation of renewable energy in the UK
relies, in large part, on regulatory and financial support of the Government. Any changes to these policies have in the past,
and may continue to, materially affect our existing business as support mechanisms, in particular the RO Scheme and the
CfD Regime are essential to the viability of our business.

Changes in the laws and policies of the UK and the EU have a direct impact on our development and future regime
operations, as our generation and electricity supply businesses are based solely in the UK. The UK is currently required by
the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) to procure 15 per cent. of the UK’s energy demand from renewable sources
by 2020. There is a significant amount of uncertainty as to what the EU Member States’ obligations will be after this date. In
October 2014, the European Council agreed on a new 2030 framework for climate change and energy, including EU-wide
targets and policy objectives for the period between 2020 and 2030. This framework sets an EU-wide target of 27 per cent.
for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030. This target is binding at the EU level but has not yet been
translated into specific national targets. The European Parliament has called upon the European Commission to present
renewable energy legislation and to increase even further the ambition level to a target of at least 30 per cent. The
Government has also set carbon emissions targets for the UK pursuant to the Climate Change Act 2008. See “Industry
_Overview—UK clean energy legislation—The Climate Change Act 2008”._

While the UK and the EU have, in recent years, adopted policies and support mechanisms actively supporting
electricity generation from renewable resources and specifically biomass, it is possible that this approach could change in the
future, due to a change in Government or a change in Government policy. Any change in the Government’s policy towards
fossil fuels, such as increasing the price of the Carbon Price Floor to make it prohibitively expensive to burn coal for
electricity generation or, conversely, an abandonment of support for renewable energy, which would render generation based
on biomass uncompetitive in comparison with other technologies, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Until August 2015, we also received LECs for electricity
generated from the generation units that had been converted to biomass which could be sold to electricity suppliers. Effective
1 August 2015, electricity generation is no longer eligible for LECs, which we estimate resulted in a negative impact on our
EBITDA of approximately £30 million in 2015 and £60 million in 2016. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our
_Business and Industry—The reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or_


-----

_other relevant changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial_
_condition and results of operations.”_

In its Spring 2017 Budget, the Government announced that the budget for low-carbon electricity investment across the
various support schemes, including the RO Scheme, CfD Regime and SS-FiT, supported by the Levy Control Framework,
the Government’s means of controlling the costs of supporting low-carbon electricity, is to be reviewed and replaced with a
new set of control measures later in 2017. It is unknown which changes, if any, the Government will make to the Levy
Control Framework, but any changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, and in particular, our generation
from biomass and the potential for converting further coal-fired generation units at the Power Station to burn biomass.

_The Renewables Obligation Scheme_

Renewables Obligation Certificates (“ROCs”) are tradable certificates issued by the Office of Gas and Electricity
Markets (“Ofgem”) to generators generating electricity through renewable resources, see “Industry Overview—UK clean
_energy legislation—The Renewables Obligation”. ROCs are only earned on electricity generated from renewable and_
sustainable material, which requires strict compliance with contractual sustainability criteria for biomass pellets. We generate
revenue by selling the ROCs we earn to electricity suppliers in the market who use these certificates to demonstrate that they
are procuring a certain percentage of the electricity that they supply from renewable resources. We receive ROCs at a rate of
1.0 ROC per MWh for renewable energy produced in our first two generation units converted to biomass.

As of 1 April 2017, the RO Scheme has been replaced by the CfD Regime for any newly accredited plant or generation
units. Existing plant or generation units already accredited under the RO Scheme (such as the Power Station, including the
coal-fired units but excluding the unit receiving support under the CfD Regime) remain under the RO Scheme until either
their period of support ends, currently designated as 2027, or if they obtain support under the CfD Regime instead.

On 22 July 2015, DBEIS, formerly the Department for Energy and Climate Change (“DECC”), confirmed that,
effective as of 12 December 2014, new biomass conversion units and combustion units already receiving support under the
RO Scheme that move for the first time into the mid-range co-firing, high-range co-firing or biomass conversion bands,
would no longer be covered by the Government’s grandfathering policy. As a result, if the remaining coal-fired generation
units at the Power Station (which are accredited under the RO Scheme) are converted to biomass there is no guarantee that
the level of support that they would be entitled to receive under the RO Scheme will not be altered in the future (and so
potentially be less than the level of support provided to our two existing biomass-fired units receiving RO support).

_Contracts for Difference_

The UK Energy Act 2013 established the CfD Regime as a new support mechanism to replace the RO Scheme with a
period of transition between 2015 and 2018. We secured our CfD under the Final Investment Decision Enabling for
Renewables (“FIDeR”) regime in 2014 for our third biomass-fired conversion unit (the “Investment Contract”). This unit
converted to biomass with support under our CfD in December 2016 following receipt of State-aid approval from the
European Commission. As of 31 December 2016, our CfD provided for a strike price of £105.86 per MWh. The strike price
is indexed annually based on the consumer price index and is also adjusted to reflect average system balancing costs. Our
CfD expires on 31 March 2027, and may be terminated before that date if we breach certain of our obligations under the
contract, for example if we fail to make payments due under the contract within the applicable grace periods. Support under
our CfD is only given on electricity generated from renewable and sustainable material and strict compliance with contractual
sustainability criteria for biomass pellets is required. Accordingly, there is a risk that our CfD terminates early and there can
be no assurance that support under our CfD will be available until the expiry of its initial term.

_RO Scheme and CfD Regime_

Both the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime as they apply to us will end in 2027. Absent a successor support scheme, the
generation of electricity from our biomass-fired generation units may not be economically viable if the support under the RO
Scheme and our CfD fall away.

It is unclear what subsidy regime, if any, will support generation from sustainable biomass after 2027. Any future
subsidy regime will depend on a number of circumstances beyond our control, including Government policies at the relevant
time, the competitiveness of electricity generation from biomass compared with other renewable energy sources, and the
availability of biomass fuel in sufficient quantities and on terms that are economical. Since the initial application process for
our CfD, there has been some uncertainty regarding Government support for future large scale biomass conversion projects.
The Government’s decision that biomass conversion projects will not be eligible to participate in the 2017 CfD auction has
further increased the uncertainty regarding the availability of continued support for large scale electricity generation from
biomass. Lack of Government support for biomass post-2027 may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_Our business is subject to complex regulations by the Government, the EU and other authorities that have in the past and_**
**_could in the future materially adversely affect us._**

Our business is subject to extensive and complex regulation by the Government and other authorities, including those
in the UK, the EU and the U.S., such as Ofgem, the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), the Agency for the
Cooperation of Energy Regulators (the “ACER”), the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. Regulation impacts many areas of our business, including the sourcing of biomass,
combustion activity, the overall energy market structure, the construction and operation of electricity generation facilities, the
trading of commodities and financial derivatives, market behaviour rules, present or prospective wholesale or retail
competition and general health and safety and environmental matters. These rules and policies have affected and may
continue to affect our business operations and changes in law or regulation, or decisions by Governmental bodies or
regulators could negatively affect our business.

Our Generation segment is also subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become increasingly strict.
For example, since the start of 2016, we have been subject to new, stricter limits on the emission of, among other things, SO2
and NOx, under UK legislation implementing the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”). We have had to make
significant investments in new technology to ensure that the Power Station can meet these obligations. We may become
subject to even stricter emissions limits or other environmental restrictions in the future, which may require significant
investment or may force us to reduce or cease electricity generation from some or all of the generation units to comply or to
install or upgrade pollution control or abatement technology to reduce emissions. These costs and operational changes could
have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our Retail segment is required to take all reasonable steps to provide Smart Meters to our customers by the end of
2020, except for those customers who have already received certain advanced meter types. As a result of the Opus
Acquisition, we have a significantly larger customer base to whom Smart Meters must be provided and, as a result, there is an
increased risk that we may be unable to provide such Smart Meters prior to the end of 2020, increasing our exposure to fines
from Ofgem for material non-compliance. Ofgem also required electricity suppliers to provide advanced meters allowing
automated meter readings (“AMRs”) to certain customers by April 2014, as a condition to their supply licences. Failure to
comply with the obligation to provide Smart Meters and/or any investigations arising into our Retail segment’s compliance
with its AMR obligations may result in the issue of material fines by Ofgem.

Other relevant changes in the regulatory environment may involve, for example:

    - changes to or withdrawal of subsidy and financial support mechanisms related to the conversion to renewable
energy sources, such as biomass or the high-range co-firing of biomass with fossil fuels. See “The reduction or
_abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other relevant changes in_
_governmental energy policy may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of_
_operations.”;_

    - changes in legislation or policies related to tax;

    - introduction of export tariffs or restrictions on the import of biomass or other fuels;

    - adverse decisions on the granting or renewal of licences, approvals or agreements required for the operation of our
business, or related to compliance with the terms of a licence, approval or regulatory requirement;

    - changes in regulations that affect exemptions that we rely on for trading financially settled derivatives, margining
requirements and reporting obligations;

    - restrictions on the timely recovery of incurred expenditure or obligations, the ability to pass through commodity
costs or a decoupling of energy usage and revenue and other general economic decisions having an effect on our
financial condition, markets and customers;

    - new or revised climate change and environmental laws and regulations, including carbon emissions limits both
nationally and internationally;

    - increases in the Carbon Price Support rates or changes in the mechanism;

    - introduction of more stringent requirements in relation to the retail electricity market; limitations or restrictions on
the amount of profits retail suppliers can make and price freezes in relation to retail supply;

    - introduction of more stringent requirements in relation to environmental and health and safety laws, sustainability
criteria for biomass pellets and regulations covering limits on emissions to air and water, noise, soil, groundwater
contamination, waste, and health and safety standards; and

    - introduction of new and/or additional legislation or licence requirements affecting the way in which our Retail
segment interacts with or charges its customers such as in relation to customer data.


-----

Changes in the regulatory environment applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and the ability to develop our businesses in the future.

**_The result of the UK referendum on withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on economic conditions,_**
**_financial markets and demand for our products and services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

We are based in and operate principally within the UK. On 23 June 2016, a majority of voters in the UK opted to
withdraw from the EU in a national referendum and on 29 March 2017, the Government formally initiated the withdrawal
process (“Brexit”). The terms of withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years. The
outcome of the referendum and the terms of withdrawal have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship
between the UK and the EU, and has given rise to calls for certain regions within the UK to preserve their place in the EU by
separating from the UK. Depending on the terms of Brexit, the UK could lose access to the single EU market resulting in an
impact on the general and economic conditions in the UK, which will directly impact the financial condition of our
customers. A significant weakening of economic conditions in the UK accompanied by higher insolvency rates could impact
our receivables growth and charge-off rates in the Retail segment, and could also result in a decrease in energy consumption,
which could adversely affect our performance.

Until the terms of Brexit become clear, it is not possible to determine the impact Brexit may have on our business. If
the UK were to leave the EU customs union, this could result in new or increased tariffs being levied on our imports of wood
pellets or the imposition of other non-tariff barriers such as higher documentation requirements or more time consuming
custom checks. It may also impact liquidity in the UK electricity and gas markets, as a result of “market decoupling” between
the UK and the rest of the EU.

The effects of Brexit could be significant as the Government would no longer be subject to the set of EU directives,
which commit the EU Member States to reducing carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency and increasing renewable
energy production. Any change in the Government’s policy towards renewable energy targets could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Future changes in legislation might impact the supply of electricity to the retail market, which could include restrictions_**
**_on retail prices or our ability to pass on costs._**

Government policy might impact the electricity price by imposing restrictions on the prices that can be charged to end
users. It is difficult to predict the manner in which this would impact the wholesale electricity price. However, if the
Government were to uncouple the wholesale electricity price from the price of commodities and other costs through a price
freeze or similar action, this could lead to a reduction in our revenues from electricity generation. Restrictions on retail prices
that our Retail segment is able to charge its customer base or on our Retail segment’s ability to implement the price change
provisions in its supply contracts or any requirement to extend fixed term contracts on the same terms may also adversely
affect the business and results of our Retail segment, by reducing its operating margins.

**_Our cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, as well as costs to address any environmental liabilities_**
**_arising from our operating activities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results_**
**_of operations._**

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to pollution, including wastewater discharges and air emissions, the
protection of the environment, and the use and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials. If we fail to comply
with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or operation of our facilities could be
forcibly stopped, curtailed or modified or could become subject to additional costs. Any such event could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We could incur liability under national or local laws or regulations, either as a polluter or as the party managing certain
aspects of any of the facilities we own, including the Power Station. Potentially hazardous activities that arise in connection
with our business include the operation and maintenance of electricity generation facilities (including the disposal of byproducts associated with such generation such as ash disposal which is disposed of on the Power Station site), the operation
and maintenance of pellet production plants and port facilities and transporting physical commodities, particularly biomass,
which is highly combustible.

Electricity generation facilities also typically use and generate hazardous and potentially hazardous products and byproducts. In addition, there may be other aspects of our operations that are not currently regarded as having adverse effects
but could in future. Although Drax Power carries insurance that covers certain environmental liabilities as a result of sudden
and accidental pollution, we do not have any reserved cash funds held to meet requirements with environmental regulations
and any such requirements imposed on the Power Station, or other facilities we own, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

In addition, we may be responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of facilities
that we have acquired or developed, such as the wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the U.S. or the planned OCGT plants,
leased or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with
certain acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide, indemnification against certain
environmental liabilities. Another party could, depending on the circumstances, assert an environmental claim against us or
fail to meet its indemnification obligations. Any costs incurred in relation to such environmental liabilities over and above
those covered by applicable insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We are increasingly subject to regulation in relation to climate change and are affected by requirements to encourage
the reduction in energy use by our customers. Failure to comply with these regulations may have an adverse impact on our
reputation and result in the imposition of fines or penalties. For example, in 2014, we agreed to a settlement with Ofgem
relating to our failure to comply with our obligations under the Community Energy Savings Programme, resulting in our
agreeing to make a £20 million consumer redress payment and pay an £8 million fine.

We commit significant expenditure towards complying with these laws and regulations and meeting our obligations. If
more onerous requirements are imposed or our ability to recover these costs under applicable regulation changes, this could
adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. This also applies to any
breach of our regulatory or contractual obligations or our climate change targets, or even incidents that do not amount to a
breach.

**_Our operations expose us to the risk of material health and safety liabilities, which leave us open to substantial liabilities,_**
**_fines and penalties._**

We are subject to laws and regulations (particularly in the UK and the U.S.) governing health and safety matters that
protect the public and our employees who could potentially be harmed by our activities.

On account of the nature of our operations, we are subject to various statutory compliance and litigation risks under
health, safety and employment laws including in the UK and the U.S. In particular, our operations at the Power Station, the
manufacturing process at our pellet production facilities and our port operations at Baton Rouge all (when operational)
require the operation of heavy machinery and other forms of industrial equipment that increase health and safety risk. In
addition, there is also the inherent risk of fire, explosion and dust inhalation that arises from the inappropriate handling and
burning of biomass. In 2016, we recorded four reportable accidents (compared to two in 2015) and had a total recordable
injury rate (defined as the sum of fatalities, lost time injuries and medical treatment injuries per 100,000 hours worked) of
0.22. There can be no guarantee that there will be no accidents or incidents suffered by our employees, our contractors or
other third-parties at our facilities and/or construction projects nor that the regulator will not take action in respect of
previously reported accidents. If we fail to put in place appropriate procedures and/or any of these incidents occur, we could
be subject to prosecutions and litigation, which may lead to fines, penalties and other damages being imposed and cause
damage to our reputation. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, exposure to material health and safety liabilities could affect our brand
image, reputation, press coverage, and possibly have political and regulatory implications, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are required to satisfy certain sustainability criteria under our CfD, and UK or EU sustainability policy changes could_**
**_be excessively onerous and make it difficult for us to comply with these policy requirements._**

To be eligible to receive support under the RO Scheme or the CfD Regime, biomass burned in the Power Station must
meet strict sustainability criteria. These criteria are directed at ensuring that, among other things, feedstock is sourced
sustainably and overall emissions from harvesting, pelletising, transporting and burning the pellets are under a certain level.
The terms of our CfD only provide very limited protection against the impact of any change in these criteria, including
changes that are enacted or come into effect after the date of our CfD. We will have to comply with changed sustainability
criteria at our cost to the extent these are deemed to be foreseeable at the date of our CfD or where such change in law,
regulation or guidance represents a continuous improvement or development of good practice. In the case of certain other
changes to sustainability criteria, we may be compensated for operating expenditure if we can demonstrate that such change
directly results in additional operating costs that would otherwise cause the permanent cessation of operation of the biomassfired generation unit receiving support under our CfD. Any change in the applicable sustainability criteria could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_An inability to source fuel to the correct technical specification could lead to a reduced output from the Power Station._**

The Power Station is only able to burn coal and biomass that meets its specifications as to, among other things, their
calorific content. The specifications for biomass are particularly stringent. If fuel meeting these specifications is not available
in sufficient amounts, generation at the Power Station may be reduced.


-----

Biomass fuel is derived from forestry residues and woody materials, and although typically more homogeneous than
coal from a chemical composition perspective, there is some variability. The degree of variability on biomass received by us
is controlled through the contract fuel specification, which contains a range for the key parameters such as calorific value,
ash, moisture and physical characteristics. The consequence of this variability means that at times biomass generation can be
adversely affected by lack of appropriate fuel. This could delay the anticipated supply of biomass fuel to the Power Station
and as a result the Power Station’s ability to generate may be reduced.

If a major biomass fuel supplier is unable to meet its contractual obligations, we will have to secure replacement
biomass fuel in an illiquid market and could suffer the additional variable costs. This could result in loss of revenue that
could adversely affect our business operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, if our procedures are inappropriate and we fail to use coal or biomass of the requisite specification in our
generation units, generation at the Power Station may be reduced and may result in damage to our facilities.

**_Negative news and other publicity regarding the use of biomass for electricity generation may have an adverse impact on_**
**_our reputation, business and results of operations and may make it difficult to gain support for the conversion of further_**
**_generation units to biomass._**

Special interest groups, environmental groups and public figures have in the past, and may in the future, allege that the
environmental benefits of electricity generation from biomass are elusive by questioning the sustainability benefits of our
biomass sourcing. Such negative publicity could change public perception of biomass and jeopardise our chances of gaining
the required political support for the conversion of further generation units to biomass in the future, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are dependent on continued output from our facilities, in particular the Power Station, and outages at the Power_**
**_Station or any of our other facilities could negatively affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

The successful operation of our business depends on maintaining the integrity of our key systems and equipment, such
as the Power Station and the wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the U.S.. Most of our revenue and gross profit in 2016
was derived from the sale of electricity produced and the ROCs earned by the Power Station. If operations at the Power
Station were to be materially interrupted, curtailed or reduced for any reason, it could adversely affect our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Power Station and our other systems and equipment
may be subject to mechanical failure, equipment malfunction, technological breakdown or other interruptions from events,
some of which are beyond our control, including:

    - fire, explosion, flood and other natural disasters;

    - adverse weather conditions;

     - failures of the electricity grid;

    - failure of fuel transportation equipment;

    - mechanical failures;

    - telecommunication or data networking failures;

    - failure to control humidity at biomass storage or transport facilities;

    - terrorism; and

    - unauthorised physical or electronic access, including cyber attacks.

Availability of the Power Station’s units is influenced by planned maintenance outages, as well as unplanned or forced
outages, which are required from time to time to rectify malfunctions or other failures. During 2016, the Power Station’s
availability was 77.1 per cent. compared with 85.1 per cent. in 2015, principally due to two major planned outages in 2016
(one of which took longer to complete than anticipated due to an unplanned equipment failure) compared with one major
planned outage in 2015 in addition to four smaller planned outages for essential repair work. In 2017, we anticipate a major
planned outage for our third biomass-fired generation unit that is supported by the CfD Regime, which is scheduled to last
approximately 10-12 weeks during the summer. See “Our _Business—Generation—Availability”._

Forced outages decrease the amount of electricity that the relevant generation unit at the Power Station is able to
generate over a given period, which translates into decreased potential revenue for us. Furthermore, additional costs may be
incurred in recovering from any such forced outage. Prolonged forced outages, or additional planned outages that become
required as a result of a regulatory change, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, financial
position and cash flows. In addition, forced outages could also damage our reputation.


-----

The most frequent cause for a forced outage of a generation unit at the Power Station is a boiler tube leak in that
generation unit. Such leaks occur at the Power Station approximately 25 times a year and ordinarily take one or two days to
remedy. More severe forced outages, which are less common, could curtail generation of a particular unit or multiple units
for a longer period, increasing any adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.

Our coal-fired generation units increasingly have higher generation costs than the “marginal plant”, in particular during
the summer months. We run the coal-fired generation units less and cease generation in low demand periods such as
overnight when they are not economically viable. As a result, the coal-fired generation units need to be turned down and
started up more frequently. We believe that the increased number of starts increases the risk of forced outages for the coalfired generation units, due to increased thermal cycling, which adds stress at a higher rate than if the coal-fired generation
unit was operating at a full load. We believe that reduced coal-fired generation unit loads may also increase technical risk in
these units.

As a result of our conversion to a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator, we face an increased level of technical
risk. Biomass generation on an industrial scale carries significant uncertainty because it is a relatively new technology.
Unforeseen technical problems may occur as a result of the conversion of the Power Station’s generation units, which were
originally designed to burn coal, due to the difference in the chemical composition of biomass and coal.

There is no extended history of industrial large-scale biomass conversions or know how as to the potential adverse
long-term effects of burning biomass in a boiler originally designed for coal and there could be, for example, corrosion,
erosion and fouling of the boiler, which could lead to increased forced outage rates on biomass units. In addition, the
hygroscopic nature (tendency to absorb moisture from the air) of biomass increases the likelihood of fire and explosions.
These risks may be further enhanced as existing supply-demand imbalances in the pellet market places suppliers under price
pressure which in turn could negatively impact the quality of wood pellets supplied to us.

We may not be able to generate sufficient electricity to perform our obligations under our wholesale supply contracts
due to outages at the Power Station. In such cases, we may have to purchase the shortfall of electricity from the wholesale
market at unfavourable prices to perform our obligations under the contracts and may suffer losses. We may suffer further
losses due to balancing charges applied by the System Operator to cover the costs of remedying the lost output on the grid.
These could adversely impact our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on an uninterrupted supply chain for biomass and, to a lesser extent, coal. Any interruptions of the supply chain_**
**_may prevent the Power Station from functioning at full capacity and prevent us from performing our supply obligations_**
**_under our contracts._**

_Transportation_

The fuel, whether biomass or coal, must be transported to the Power Station from domestic and overseas suppliers. We
rely on the continued availability of sufficient international sea freight capacity, port and rail capacity and UK infrastructure
to handle and transport biomass and coal in a timely and efficient manner. We currently have contracts in place for port
capacity (and redundancy) that enables us to receive the required amounts of fuel into the UK. Our contract with one of the
four ports handling our biomass will expire in 2022 (with an option to extend) while the contracts with the remaining three
ports will expire on or after 2027. Our contract with the port handling coal will expire at the end of 2017, and is in the
process of being renewed. Any termination of, or failure to renew, these contracts may lead to an increase in costs as supply
may have to be transported from a less optimal port location.

A significant part of fuel received at our UK ports is transported to the Power Station by rail. A failure in our rail
transportation, such as the inability to secure adequate rail paths, damage to the rail network itself or damage or technical
failures in relation to our specialist rolling stock for biomass transportation could impede our ability to transport the required
volume of fuel to the Power Station by rail or may lead to increased costs as fuel may have to be transported to the Power
Station via more costly forms of transportation.

Furthermore, changes in shipping and rail regulations, whether relating directly to fuel transportation or otherwise, may
lead to increased costs.

_Biomass storage_

Biomass cannot be stored outdoors because it tends to absorb moisture from the air. Pellets can spontaneously combust
if inappropriately stored and therefore must be managed. In the case of our loading facility in the U.S., humidity poses an
additional challenge, which must be addressed using aeration and temperature monitoring. At the UK discharge ports and at
the Power Station, the pellets are stored in technically advanced storage spaces with dust control infrastructure to reduce the
risk of fire and explosions. Any failure of the management controls and infrastructure or safety procedures at the production
facilities could result in fire damage, including personal injuries, at the Power Station, our pellet manufacturing facilities or at
our port facilities. Such incidents may materially hinder our ability to export sufficient biomass to the Power Station for a
certain amount of time and our ability to generate electricity at optimum levels or otherwise adversely affect our operations.


-----

Our biomass storage capacity at the UK port facilities and on-site at the Power Station is approximately 700,000
tonnes, which corresponds to approximately 30 days’ supply at full capacity. This storage capacity may be insufficient for the
Power Station’s needs at times of seasonal high demand, curbing our potential to maximise our generation revenues. In
addition, fuel that is scheduled to be burned might need to be stored instead due to planned outages or forced outages, which
can result in storage of large volumes of biomass with high storage costs for us. In the case of forced outages, biomass can
quickly accumulate at the ports before it can be moved to strategic storage spaces. Storage spaces at the ports may also fill up
quickly, which in turn prevents ships from unloading, and consequently resulting in demurrage costs if the biomass vessel
deliveries cannot be delayed or rerouted. As a result of supplier failures in the supply chain, we may not be able to generate
electricity at full capacity and may not be able to perform our supply obligations under our contracts. We may suffer further
losses due to balancing charges applied by the System Operator or may have to purchase top-up biomass consignments if
available.

**_Increased transportation costs could materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition._**

Transportation plays an important role in our supply chain as we source the majority of the coal and biomass required
for our Generation segment internationally. We currently source most of our coal from the U.S., Colombia and the UK, and
most of our biomass from the U.S. and Canada. We generally rely on third-party service providers to transport fuels and our
ability to source fuel at commercially reasonable costs depends on our ability to negotiate commercially reasonable terms
with carriers. Accordingly, any increases in freight charges, port charges or other transportation costs will, to the extent
unhedged, lead to increases in the cost of our supplies and could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that third-party carriers increase their rates, including to reflect
higher labour, maintenance, fuel or other costs they may incur, we may incur higher fuel costs, which may have a negative
impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.

**_Fuel supplies can be destabilised by concentration of supply, market risks, sanctions and geographic risks._**

Biomass at the correct specifications is available in the UK only in limited amounts. This concentration of our supply
in certain other countries increases our exposure to risks such as industrial action, political or economic sanctions, regulatory
change, export tariffs, weather risk and political instability, each of which may lead to a restriction in the supply of the fuel.

The biomass market is a nascent and illiquid market and, if we are not able to secure the required volumes to fuel the
converted units on a long-term basis, this could adversely affect the output of those units. Our U.S. biomass supply chain is
particularly subject to weather risk as it is concentrated in the southern states of the U.S. where extreme weather such as
hurricanes is prevalent. Equally, our U.S. port facilities in Baton Rouge are the only port facilities in the area that have the
storage and technical capacity to export the wood pellets manufactured by our pellet manufacturing facilities. Furthermore,
given the limited number of participants in the biomass market, it may be difficult for us to obtain pellets of a sufficient
quality and sustainability standard to fuel the Power Station and/or trade with counterparties with a robust credit profile. A
breakdown in the supply chains could adversely affect our business operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

We are subject to commodity price risks that we may not be able to hedge against efficiently and our fuel costs could
increase at a faster rate than UK electricity prices which could negatively affect our operating margins.

The largest component of our cost of sales is fuel costs. Fuel costs amounted to £1,154.2 million (net of renewable
power support), or 39.1 per cent. of revenue in 2016 and comprise the cost of biomass and coal. The gross cost of both fuels
includes the cost of the raw material, processing costs, logistics, handling and storage costs and is influenced by exchange
rates where the fuel and its transportation is contracted in a foreign currency. Any element of these costs might increase for
coal and biomass without a proportionate increase in UK electricity prices. While we regularly enter into derivative
transactions to hedge our exposure to these commodity price and foreign exchange currency risks, there can be no assurance
that such hedging will be effective and we are subject to risks in connection with the hedging arrangements we enter into
(such as counterparty risks). There can be no assurances that we will be able to hedge our exposure to these risks in the
future. Any increase in our fuel costs could lead to a reduction in margins and cash flow and therefore adversely affect our
business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

_Biomass_

Biomass is a new and developing market. The cost of biomass is made up of two elements: the gross cost of purchasing
fuel less the value of the renewable power support. The fuel costs can be broken down into the raw fibre cost, cost of
processing the pellets and the cost of freight and transport to the Power Station. Other factors affecting biomass fuel costs
include foreign currency exchange fluctuations (as most biomass is priced in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and euro), oil
prices (relevant for transportation and processing costs), freight costs, hedging costs, working capital requirements, labour
rates and inflation.


-----

We seek to fix fuel supply costs as far into the future as liquidity and credit constraints permit. This can be difficult as
suppliers typically are unwilling or unable to manage these costs and seek to pass them through to the purchaser. Although
we seek to hedge exposures where possible, this can be expensive and collateral-intensive. Moreover, fully hedging these
costs on a long-term basis is not practicable due to liquidity and credit restraints. A reduction in the extent to which we are
able to hedge biomass fuel costs could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations because biomass costs are not correlated to UK electricity prices and therefore represent a significant source of
volatility in earnings and cash flow.

Unlike coal purchases, a number of our biomass supply contracts are entered into on a “take-or-pay” basis. Should
biomass generation become uneconomic or be curtailed for any other reason, we could be required to take delivery of the
biomass in excess of any revised burn estimate and then have to store it, sell it to third-parties, if such purchasers can be
found, or pay for the cost of the biomass without taking delivery. This could lead to losses for us. See “—We rely on an
_uninterrupted supply chain for biomass and, to a lesser extent, coal. Any interruptions of the supply chain may prevent the_
_Power Station from functioning at full capacity and prevent us from performing our supply obligations under our contracts”._

_Coal_

The cost of coal includes both the cost of the actual coal burnt and the cost of the carbon in the form of the emissions
allowances purchased to ensure our compliance with the EU Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”) and the levy on coal
deliveries under the Carbon Price Support mechanism. In addition to the risk of coal prices generally increasing, whether
through market price rises and/or exchange rate fluctuations, the cost of carbon might also increase as a result of the EU’s
intervention in the EU ETS market or due to a Government decision to further increase the amounts payable under the
Carbon Price Support mechanism, which were the subject of a significant rate increase in April 2014. The cost of coal and
carbon allowances is driven by market prices at the time we secure our purchases. If we cannot match the timing of coal and
carbon purchases to the related electricity sales or the cost of coal and carbon increases, then this mismatch could have a
negative impact on profitability.

**_The maintenance of the Power Station, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and our other facilities_**
**_requires substantial capital expenditure and may not be adequate to prevent plant failure._**

We are regularly required to make certain operational and maintenance-related capital expenditures at our sites, such as
equipment and other infrastructure maintenance, including machine parts for the Power Station. Our ability to undertake such
operational and maintenance measures largely depends on our cash flow from our operations and access to capital. We intend
to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations. However, there may be unforeseen capital expenditure
needs for which we may not have adequate capital. If we do not have adequate capital to service our facilities, we may not be
able to operate our facilities as efficiently, or at all.

The Power Station, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and our other facilities require regular
maintenance and the provision of this maintenance is itself subject to certain risks. A number of problems may arise in
relation to our facilities during maintenance, which may cause interruptions to production, including, among other things,
failed deliveries by suppliers or manufacturers or longer than expected periods for technical adjustments. In particular, failure
of a contractor to perform our contracted services and/or a change in a contractor’s financial circumstances in conjunction
with an overreliance on particular contractors may, among other things, result in the relevant asset either underperforming or
becoming impaired in value and there can be no assurance that such underperformance, impairment or delay will be fully or
partially compensated by any contractor warranty or bank guarantee (which are usually limited in scope and quantum, and
typically will not cover full loss of profit). The additional costs and loss of revenue that may arise in the maintenance of
facilities may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We face development risks in relation to the development and construction of the Open Cycle Gas Turbine assets._**

We acquired four individual OCGT projects in December 2016, which are in various stages of the planning and
development process. The economics underpinning any future development of these OCGT projects is predicated upon each
project successfully obtaining a 15-year capacity market agreement in future Capacity Market auctions above a certain price.
We entered two of these OCGT projects in the Capacity Market auction in December 2016, but were not successful in
securing a capacity market agreement for either of those OCGT projects. We intend to enter these OCGT projects in future
Capacity Market auctions, including one or more projects in the T-4 Capacity Market Auction in December 2017, but there is
no guarantee that we will be able to secure a capacity market agreement for any of these OCGT projects in the future. For
further information on the Capacity Market, see “Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Capacity
_Market”._

The initial purchase price for the four OCGT projects amounted to £18.5 million. The purchase agreements for two of
the OCGT projects also included a mechanism providing for additional consideration contingent on these projects being


-----

successful in the next four T-4 Capacity Market Auctions and calculated based on the clearing price of those Capacity Market
auctions. Accordingly, the total final purchase price for the four OCGT projects may be up to £90.5 million.

If our OCGT projects do not receive a capacity market agreement at an economically attractive price in the Capacity
Market auctions, we may choose not to develop the projects and our initial investment could be impaired.

If we decide to develop the OCGT projects, we will also have to fund the costs associated with completing the approval
process, constructing the power stations and procuring the necessary equipment, in addition to the purchase price of the
projects under their purchase agreements. We expect that each OCGT project will cost an additional £80 million to
£100 million to develop, but given the early development stages of the OCGT projects there is significant uncertainty as to
the final completion costs. Any delay or objection in relation to the process for obtaining the relevant approvals, permits or
licences, procurement or construction delay or change in Government policy could result in delays to the estimated
commencement date for commercial operations, increased costs, and the need to obtain planning amendments.

Furthermore, our OCGT projects must obtain and maintain connections to the electricity grid and gas transmission
network. This process may be costly and time consuming, as we must obtain, among other requirements, planning and other
consents from relevant authorities, secure any required easements or wayleaves from landowners and construct the physical
connection between the OCGT project and the applicable electricity and gas grids. Any failure or delay to obtain the
necessary approvals, permits or licences, enter into the procurement or construction agreements or delays in establishing the
connection between the relevant OCGT project and the relevant grid could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our results from operations are dependent on our exposure to UK wholesale electricity prices and the UK economy._**

Our profitability and potential growth is determined principally by the prices received for the electricity we generate
and our cost of fuel. All of our generation activities are in the UK, exposing us to significant concentration risk with respect
to the UK electricity price.

The wholesale electricity price in the UK is volatile and is affected by the market demand for electricity and supplyside factors, including (i) the generation mix of power stations in the UK or interconnected to it; and (ii) fluctuations in the
market prices of other commodities. Fluctuations in the wholesale price caused by these factors can occur over a long or short
period of time. Any decrease in the market price of electricity will adversely affect our margins for the electricity we generate
and may result in lower revenues in our Retail segment. A reduction in the wholesale electricity price in the UK could
therefore adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

_Market demand_

Demand for electricity in the UK has historically been driven by a number of factors outside our control, such as the
overall level of economic activity, seasonality, prevailing weather patterns and increased energy efficiency. A decrease
and/or prolonged deterioration in economic activity in the UK, for any reason, could result in a decrease in demand for
electricity in the market. For example, during the last recession, demand for electricity from UK industrials decreased by
12.6 per cent. from 114.15TWh in 2008 to 99.74TWh in 2009. A fall in demand for electricity could lead to a reduction in the
wholesale and retail prices for electricity. Short-term and seasonal fluctuations in electricity demand can also affect the price
at which we can sell electricity. Demand for electricity is typically higher between October and March and lower between
April and September. These seasonal effects can be reinforced or mitigated by weather patterns.

In our Retail segment, longer term reductions in demand could result in reduced revenue and profit for Haven Power
and the Opus Group if the market price at which our Retail segment can sell electricity decreases, particularly in the event
electricity originally purchased under long-term, fixed price supply agreements destined for customers has to be sold in the
market for a lower price than that which could be recovered under Haven Power’s and the Opus Group’s supply contracts.

Wholesale electricity prices may also be affected by the level of interconnector capacity connected to the UK electricity
grid. Current continental interconnector capacity is equivalent to approximately 6 per cent. of peak demand. If electricity can
be generated cheaply overseas and exported to the UK then this will displace the more expensive marginal UK plant and
reduce electricity prices. This could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

_Generation mix_

The wholesale electricity price is principally driven by the fuel costs of the “marginal plant” as a power station’s cost
of generation is determined largely by the cost of the type of fuel used. Some power stations have negative marginal costs of
generation, such as those that use wind or solar, because the subsidies provided to these renewable generators exceed the cost
of generation. A potential change in the generation mix towards lower marginal cost electricity generation could bring down
the wholesale electricity price and thereby reduce the revenues we receive from the sale of electricity.


-----

Power stations can be modelled, according to their different costs of generation, as a stack, which is overlaid with
forecasted demand for electricity. The available power stations are drawn on to supply electricity to fulfil this demand,
starting with the power stations that have the lowest costs of generation. At the point in the demand stack where forecast
demand intersects with available supply, the power station supplying electricity at the point of intersection is known as the
“marginal plant”. The price at which the marginal plant is willing to generate therefore dictates the overall market price.

The generation mix is altered by the changing economics of developing new generating plants or maintaining existing
plants, which is in turn influenced by commodity prices and the level of Government support given to various generation
technologies (including, among others, nuclear, shale gas and renewable sources such as onshore wind, offshore wind and
biomass) in addition to environmental and other taxes such as the Carbon Price Support mechanism. Government decisions,
for example, to extend or curtail the operations of nuclear and other generating plants in relation to their presently expected
dates of decommissioning, as well as Government initiatives to support the development of new technologies, such as the
establishment of the Office of Unconventional Gas for shale gas, have the potential to influence the generation mix of power
stations in the UK by making particular forms of generation more profitable or less profitable. It can also increase the supply
of electricity into the wholesale market, which could have the effect of lowering the wholesale electricity price.

In recent years, the generation mix in the UK has shifted to a higher share of electricity generated from renewable
sources with negative marginal costs (such as wind and solar). This trend has resulted in lower, but also more volatile,
wholesale power prices in the UK due to the intermittent nature of these energy sources. These developments have
contributed to the average achieved electricity price for our Generation segment decreasing in each year since 2014 and our
coal-fired generation units increasingly producing lower levels of electricity in the summer months, when demand is lower.
This trend had a negative effect on the revenues and profitability of our Generation segment in the last three years and no
upturn in coal generation and associated profitability is expected in the future, in particular because of the Government’s
continued support for renewable energy generation.

_Fluctuations in commodity prices_

The costs at which a power station can generate electricity are largely determined by the cost of the type of fuel used,
which are susceptible to market forces and vary widely, and the cost of any emissions allowances required to support
generation from fossil fuels. Therefore a decrease in the price of oil, coal, natural gas or emissions allowances typically leads
to lower wholesale electricity prices, in the longer term.

Since 2014, commodity prices have mostly been under pressure and have only started to recover relatively recently.
However, they are still below levels reached in previous years. This pressure on global commodity prices contributed to
lower prices in the UK electricity wholesale market as reflected in the lower average achieved purchase price for each MWh
of electricity produced by us since the start of 2014.

Changes in commodity prices may also influence the generation mix and drive a shift to more efficient, lower cost
power stations. Changes in the oil price may, for example, lead to lower gas prices which could increase gas use in the
generation mix and bring down the wholesale electricity price. If low gas prices persist then the wholesale electricity price
might continue to remain low and could fall further, which could in turn adversely affect our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

Gas-fired generation is the marginal plant in many periods, and therefore any fall in gas prices tends to pass through to
wholesale electricity prices. Consequently, low gas prices could, to the extent unhedged, adversely affect our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

_Taxation, regulation and system costs_

To the extent that any taxes or other levies, such as Carbon Price Support, transmission or balancing costs, are
embedded within the wholesale cost of energy, any change in the way these are recovered will affect wholesale prices and
potentially their recoverability as third-party charges. In addition, any variance in relative taxes between the UK and
interconnected countries may influence the volume and direction of any interconnector flows, which may raise wholesale
prices in the UK.

**_A lack of liquidity in the wholesale market for electricity could adversely affect our results of operations or require us to_**
**_alter our trading strategy._**

Liquidity in the market for wholesale electricity is dependent on there being a sufficient number of counterparties
willing to trade actively. Factors such as changes to the market structure or consolidation of the existing generation and
supply businesses could result in a reduction in the number of active participants in the market with which we are able to
trade. This may affect both our ability to sell all of our output and the prices at which we sell our output. Poor liquidity in the
wholesale market could also lead to retail suppliers quoting a wider range of prices to customers affecting the


-----

competitiveness of the prices quoted by Haven Power and the Opus Group and lead to a loss of revenue. This could adversely
affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_In the future, it may not be possible for us to mitigate against price volatility by selling forward our generated output._**

Liquidity for the trading of electricity on a forward basis is currently limited to approximately two years forward. We
attempt to minimise our exposure to price volatility and to achieve revenue certainty by selling forward a proportion of the
electricity we generate. However, there can be no assurance that forward contracts entered into in the future will capture the
best possible price for our electricity, or that there will be sufficient liquidity in the UK electricity markets to enable us to sell
our electricity as far in advance or in such quantities as we feel is optimal for our business. Due to lower wholesale electricity
prices in the UK market over the last two years, the Power Station’s coal-fired generation units have ceased to deliver
baseload electricity on a routine basis (particularly, in the summer months) and are increasingly run to provide system
support services, while our biomass-fired generation units are predominantly delivering baseload electricity. As a result, the
selling forward of coal-generated output may be more challenging. If we are unable to enter into such forward sales and
prices were to fall in the future, it could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_New UK and EU financial regulations may reduce our ability to trade products with financial or derivative characteristics._**

We enter into a significant number of derivative transactions to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks,
commodity price risk and, to a lesser degree, inflation risk and interest rate risk. However, in recent years we have become
subject to UK and EU financial regulations designed to reduce the level of perceived systemic risk inherent in the markets for
financial instruments, commodity derivatives and physical commodities on which we trade. These regulations include the
European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”), which seeks to reduce the risk in trading over-the-counter derivatives
by introducing reporting, collateral and risk mitigation requirements and the Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and
Transparency (“REMIT”), which seeks to prevent insider dealing and market manipulation through increasing transparency
in the electricity and gas markets. Regulatory changes may restrict our ability, or make it more costly for us, to enter into
derivative transactions.

The revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and accompanying regulation (together, “MiFID II”) enters
into force on 3 January 2018. The MiFID II regime brings more of our trading within its and EMIR’s scope than the existing
regime, imposes position limits on certain commodities for certain larger market participants and limits or removes our
exemption to trade commodity derivatives as an “ancillary activity” to our business without first demonstrating that we meet
the criteria for the use of the exemption and notifying the same to the FCA. Our inability to access these markets due to
liquidity issues may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operation.

These new rules could impose tighter constraints on our ability to trade physical commodities and/or commodity
derivatives without regulator authorisation, increased collateral requirements for the trading of commodities and position
limits in key wholesale commodity markets and impact, directly or indirectly, our ability to hedge commodity risk and/or sell
electricity on a forward basis. We believe that, indirectly, these constraints have negatively impacted overall market liquidity
(which impact may continue or increase) and could result in our realising reduced revenues and/or incurring higher hedging
or balancing costs to achieve our trading objectives. Our inability to access these markets due to liquidity issues may have a
material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.

In addition, as the number and complexity of financial regulations affecting us increases, there is a consequential
increase in the cost of compliance and in the risk of non-compliance. Any material failure in this respect could lead to
sanctions, including a restriction on our trading activities, fines and a reduction in the number of counterparties that are
willing to trade with us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, projects, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We may fail to secure future Ancillary Services contracts which are an important source of revenue for us._**

We actively engage with the System Operator to offer Ancillary Services such as various types of “frequency
response” (the service that manages system frequency, which relates to the balance between system demand and total
generation) and generating “reactive power” (which is injected into the grid to allow the System Operator to manage the
voltage profile of the transmission system within certain parameters). For further information, see “Our _Business—_
_Generation—Capacity Market Payments and Ancillary Services”. The provision of these services is an important source of_
revenue for us, amounting to £47.3 million in 2016. While we take steps to ensure that we continue to secure Ancillary
Services contracts in the future, there is a risk that we may fail to win these contracts in the future. In particular, many
Ancillary Services can only be provided by conventional flexible generation (coal and gas) and we may face downside
pricing pressures from competitors whose economic conditions necessitate that they require such contracts in order to avoid


-----

closing or else mothballing a plant, and the loss of or inability to win such contracts in the future could adversely affect our
business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_As result of the Opus Acquisition, we may become exposed to increased regulatory scrutiny._**

We operate in a highly regulated market subject to detailed legislation and regulation. As a result of the Opus
Acquisition, the size of our Retail segment and its customer base have increased. This may lead to increased regulatory
scrutiny or unfavourable regulatory change as regulators seek to ensure customer interests are sufficiently protected. Haven
Power and the Opus Group are subject to various supply licence conditions, which impose conditions on their operations in
relation to various matters including continuity of supply, compliance with industry codes and customer relations, including
the provision of certain information to customers. Some of these conditions are specifically designed to impact only larger
suppliers and may now attach to Haven Power and the Opus Group given their common ownership, although they would not
have applied to them on a standalone basis prior to the Opus Acquisition, putting them at a competitive disadvantage to other
small suppliers as a result. Increased regulatory scrutiny may lead to an increase cost of compliance and may result in actions
against us for non-compliance with the regulatory framework. We may also become increasingly exposed to the impact of
changes to the legal or regulatory framework in which we operate. See “—Our business is subject to complex regulations by
_the Government, the EU and other authorities that have in the past and could in the future materially adversely affect us”._

**_New businesses or activities that we undertake alone, or with partners, may not result in positive earnings and may expose_**
**_us to additional operational and financial risk._**

We have in the past from time to time entered into acquisition, disposal or joint venture transactions and expect to
continue to do so. Business development activities, including acquisitions, disposals and joint ventures, entail a number of
risks, including that they may be based on incorrect assumptions or conclusions, a failure to realise planned levels of synergy
and efficiency savings and the inability to integrate acquired businesses effectively. These could result in a loss of revenue on
account of unanticipated costs and liabilities. We may also be liable for the past acts, omissions or liabilities of companies or
businesses that we acquired or developed, which may be unforeseen or greater than anticipated at the time of the relevant
acquisition. In the case of joint ventures, we may have limited control over operations and our joint venture partners may
have interests that diverge from our interests. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and could also affect our ability to enter into other
transactions.

**_The Opus Acquisition may be reviewed under UK merger control legislation._**

The UK merger control regime applies to the Opus Acquisition as the Opus Group’s turnover in its last audited annual
accounts exceeded £70 million and we currently operate Haven Power, a retail electricity supply business. As a result, it is
possible that the UK Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) may instigate an investigation into the Opus
Acquisition. Generally, the CMA cannot refer a merger for investigation more than four months after completion.

The CMA has the power to: (i) impose an order, such as a “hold separate” order that would, among other things, delay
the integration of the Group and the Opus Group and prevent us from doing anything that might impair the ability of the
Opus Group to compete independently in any markets affected by the Opus Acquisition, pending any decision being made by
the CMA; and/or (ii) require remedies as a consequence of the Opus Acquisition, such as the divestment by us of certain
assets or businesses, the imposition of restrictions on the conduct of our businesses and/or other behavioural remedies.

We have not received any notification from the CMA indicating any intention to give a hold separate order or to start
an investigation in relation to the Opus Acquisition.

**_We may not realise, or it may take us longer to realise, the expected benefits of acquisitions and investments, including the_**
**_Opus Acquisition._**

We may fail to achieve certain or any of the anticipated benefits that we expect to realise as a result of acquisitions and
investments, including the Opus Acquisition, or it may take longer than expected to realise those benefits. Achieving the
anticipated benefits of acquisition and investments, including the Opus Acquisition, will depend, in part, on whether we
integrate the acquired business in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process is likely to present
administrative, managerial and financial challenges, some of which may not be identified until after the process progresses
further. Unforeseen difficulties, costs, liabilities, losses or delays could adversely affect our business and the realisation of the
benefits of acquisitions and investments, including the Opus Acquisition.

Potential difficulties in the integration process include:

    - coordinating services and operations;

    - consolidating and integrating procedures, systems, facilities, accounting functions, compensation structures and
other policies;


-----

    - the physical relocation of our employees (including complexities relating to (i) the growth of the new office in
Cardiff recently opened by the Opus Group; and (ii) the Opus Group’s consolidation of its existing Northampton
offices into a new building);

    - integrating the management teams and retaining and incentivising our key employees;

    - devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating our existing and new businesses;

    - operating and integrating different technology platforms and systems;

    - replacement of certain wholesale supply arrangements and harmonisation of these activities within the Group; and

    - disruption to our ongoing business.

We have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of costs in relation to the Opus Acquisition, including the
cost of integrating the Opus Group into the Group in order to combine the businesses successfully. The actual costs of the
integration process may exceed those estimated and there may be further additional and/or unforeseen expenses incurred in
connection with the Opus Acquisition.

Our expected acquisition of a third wood pellet manufacturing facility in Louisiana and the integration process that
follows is likely to pose similar risks. If the anticipated benefits that we expect to realise as a result of acquisitions and
investments, such as, in the case of the Opus Acquisition, the anticipated financial returns or the opportunity for market share
growth, are not achieved, or take longer than expected to be realised, this could have a material adverse impact on our
business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Acquired assets may have liabilities that are not known to us._**

As a result of our acquisitions or investments, we may be exposed to certain liabilities that we are unaware of at the
time of the relevant acquisition or investment.

The Opus Group was acquired with certain liabilities, including certain tax liabilities. There may be liabilities that we
failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into the Opus Group. Any such
undiscovered liabilities of the Opus Group, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, such liabilities may not be recoverable under the Opus
Share Purchase Agreement. As we integrate the Opus Group, we may learn additional information about the Opus Group that
adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws.
Similarly, our expected acquisition of a third wood pellet manufacturing facility in Louisiana may expose us to certain
liabilities such as environmental liabilities.

**_The Opus Acquisition may impact our relationship with our existing providers, customers and TPIs which, in turn, could_**
**_materially adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations._**

It is possible that the Opus Acquisition may be negatively interpreted by our existing suppliers, customers, third-party
intermediaries (“TPIs”) and/or other commercial partners. If, as a result of the Opus Acquisition, a significant number of our
existing suppliers, customers, TPIs and/or other commercial partners ceased doing, or materially reduced their, business with
us, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Following the Opus Acquisition, our reliance on TPIs has increased. Increased reliance on TPIs and termination of_**
**_relations with them might have an adverse impact on our reputation and operations._**

The Opus Group and (to a lesser extent) Haven Power rely on their relationships with TPIs in order to access new
customers and grow their businesses. TPIs, principally brokers, typically introduce customers to energy suppliers and provide
advice on suitable products in exchange for a fee, which is either charged directly to the customer or else levied via the
customer invoice for electricity consumed. As a result of the Opus Acquisition, we have a significantly larger retail business
and the importance of its relationships with TPIs has significantly increased.

The Opus Group’s relationships with TPIs are maintained by members of the Opus Group’s management team. While
plans are in place for the retention of key members of the Opus Group management, there can be no assurance that the Opus
Acquisition will not result in the departure of Opus Group employees who are important to relationships with TPIs and there
is a risk that these relationships would subsequently terminate or become less productive. The termination of relationships
with key TPIs or a significant number of TPIs, or any negative reputational impact due to our increased engagement with
TPIs might have an adverse impact on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

While TPIs are not directly regulated by Ofgem, application of more stringent rules and regulations to TPIs in the
future may render our relationships with TPIs less productive. Our increased engagement with TPIs following the Opus


-----

Acquisition could also expose us to behaviour or practices of TPIs that deviate from the TPI Code of Practice, which may
negatively impact our reputation.

**_Following the Opus Acquisition, our exposure to short-term electricity and gas price volatility has increased, which may_**
**_result in increased balancing costs._**

The Opus Group’s customer demand for electricity and gas is more weather-correlated than our retail demand prior to
the Opus Acquisition and, as a result, short-term changes in customer usage will now have a bigger impact on our results. In
particular, we are more likely to face higher than average customer demand at times of higher than average prices in the
wholesale power markets; there may be times when the selling price to customers that is achieved is lower than the cost of
purchasing energy to supply those customers in the short-term wholesale market. This comes against a background of
generally increasing volatility in the wholesale prompt power markets (in which in-day, day-ahead and weekend electricity
and gas products are traded). While we expect to take measures to forecast demand and hedge accordingly, there is a risk that
variances in forecast and actual customer demand may lead to an increase in balancing costs for us.

**_The Opus Share Purchase Agreement includes limited protections provided to us by the previous shareholders of Opus._**

The liability of the previous shareholders of Opus pursuant to the Opus Share Purchase Agreement is limited by,
among other things:

    - a limit on claims under business warranties of 18 months from the date of the Opus Share Purchase Agreement and
a seven-year limit on claims under tax warranties and the tax covenant from the date of the Opus Share Purchase
Agreement; and

    - an aggregate financial cap of: (i) £3.4 million for warranty and tax covenant claims, and (ii) the purchase price paid
by us for all other claims. Both of these caps are split severally between the previous individual shareholders of
Opus in accordance with the proportion of their shareholdings in Opus.

In addition, the liability of the insurers under the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance Policy is subject to further
limitations in addition to those contained in the Opus Share Purchase Agreement. In particular, there is an overall cap on
liability of £50 million.

Accordingly, we may not have recourse against, or otherwise be able to recover from, the previous shareholders of
Opus or under the Warranty and Indemnity Insurance Policy in respect of material losses that we may suffer in respect of a
breach of warranty or otherwise in respect of liabilities of the Opus Group.

If any material liabilities were to arise and were it not possible to make a claim under the warranties or indemnities in
respect thereof, or if any losses could not be fully recovered in respect of claims under the Opus Share Purchase Agreement,
this could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on access to and operation of the transmission and distribution networks that we do not own or operate, in order_**
**_to sell electricity._**

We contract with third-parties that own or operate electricity transmission or distribution networks to deliver the
electricity we sell. We do not own or control the transmission or distribution facilities. Electricity transmission and
distribution lines may experience unplanned outages over which we have no control. Our energy output may also be curtailed
for other reasons beyond our control. Furthermore, the operators of such networks may not comply with their contractual
obligations pertaining to transmission or distribution or they may withdraw from related agreements. The occurrence of any
of the circumstances detailed above would, to the extent that we are not entitled to receive compensation for the issue, result
in loss of revenue that could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may be unable to pass on a proportion of increased third-party costs to customers._**

We are subject to charges that are outside our control in relation to the supply of electricity to customers (“Third-party
**Charges”). Third-party Charges include, but are not limited to, grid charges, together with charges arising from the RO on**
electricity suppliers, the SS-FiT, and charges levied on market participants for the costs of CfDs and the Capacity Market,
respectively. Both Haven Power and the Opus Group, in accordance with market practice, typically pass on some or all of
these Third-party Charges to customers pursuant to the terms of some of their customer supply contracts.

The electricity supply industry is expected to experience higher rates of increase in Third-party Charges in the future as
a result of the likely continued increase in the proportion of renewable generation in the UK’s generation mix. There is
consequently a risk that we will not be able to pass on the full amount of any such increases in Third-party Charges to
customers. This risk is particularly acute in relation to the business of the Opus Group, owing to the fact that the Opus Group
has historically passed on its Third-party Charges to customers through the application of small periodic price rises. It is
possible, therefore, in circumstances where Third-party Charges increase beyond the allowances made in the Opus Group’s


-----

contracts or previously passed on, that we will, in respect of Opus Group customers, either (i) be unable to successfully pass
on the unanticipated portion of Third-party Charges; or (ii) experience a reduced customer base as a result of passing on
increased Third-party Charges resulting in an adverse impact on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_The retail energy supply markets in which we participate are highly competitive, which could lead to a loss of customers,_**
**_reduced margins or an adverse effect on our growth strategy in our Retail segment._**

We operate in a highly competitive market for retail supply. We are currently exposed to risks arising from a high level
of competition in the market for retail supply from both large established players and smaller new entrants. The UK retail
market has historically been dominated by the “Big Six” (British Gas, EDF Energy, npower, E.ON (which recently demerged
to E.ON and Uniper), Scottish Power and SSE). In recent years, an increasing number of smaller new entrants have come to
the market, which has resulted in increased competition on price, terms and services offered.

Some of our competitors or potential competitors are or may be larger or better capitalised than us, which may make it
difficult for us to compete effectively. It is possible that either in response to the Opus Acquisition or as a general strategy,
our competitors may employ highly competitive strategies, such as lower or predatory pricing or other incentives, which may
mean that we are unable to compete effectively, leading to a reduction in profits and market share and an adverse effect on
our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Fluctuations in the demand for and supply of ROCs could result in the revenues we receive from the sale of ROCs to_**
**_third-party suppliers being substantially lower than anticipated._**

Our revenue and profitability from biomass generation depend in part on the value of ROC sale revenue, which is
affected by the ROC buy-out value. In 2016, revenue from ROC and LEC sales to third-parties amounted to £362.3 million,
or 12.3 per cent. of total revenue. ROCs are ultimately used by electricity suppliers who can submit ROCs in satisfaction of
their renewables obligation or else pay the buy-out. We expect the revenues from ROC sales to decrease in 2017 and beyond
primarily due to two reasons. First, our third generation unit operating on biomass was earning ROCs as a high-range cofiring unit, burning over 85 per cent biomass, since October 2015. However, as this unit became a fully converted biomass
unit in December 2016, it started operating with support under the CfD Regime and is therefore no longer eligible to earn
ROCs. Second, the Opus Acquisition will also increase the internal demand for ROCs and so reduce the number of ROCs
that we sell on the external wholesale market.

The Government regulates the market value of a ROC to a ROC generator through control of the ROC buy-out price
and through establishing the number of ROCs that each supplier must submit at the end of each compliance period. When a
supplier fails to procure enough ROCs to meet its RO in a compliance period it must pay the ROC buy-out price for each
ROC that it failed to procure. ROCs are typically sold by the generator at a price equal to the buy-out price less a fee,
possibly also with a top-up “recycling amount”. See “—The amount of the Ofgem recycle benefit fund payment which will be
_paid over to us is unpredictable and difficult to forecast”._

The market value of ROCs is only maintained to the extent that the total overall obligation of suppliers to purchase
ROCs is greater than the supply of ROCs in the market. The Government is required to build 10 per cent. headroom into its
calculation of the level of the obligation to protect the market against unexpected fluctuations in renewable generation.
Should the supply of ROCs in the market be higher than suppliers’ overall obligation in any given compliance period (as a
result of overall renewable output being greater than forecast or demand being lower than expected), then the price paid by
suppliers when purchasing ROCs, to the extent that the oversupply of ROCs is not otherwise “banked” and held by the
relevant generator / supplier for use in the following compliance period, will decrease and the ultimate value realised for a
ROC by a generator could be materially less than our forecasts or than historically realised. In recent years, the actual
headroom achieved has declined as Ofgem has found it increasingly difficult to accurately forecast overall renewable
generation and deployment. The total number of ROCs presented in the UK and the actual headroom achieved in each of the
last five ROC compliance periods is set out in the table below:


**Headroom**
**(in per cent.)**


**ROCs presented**
**(in million ROCs)**


**Period**


**Obligation**
**(in million ROCs)**


2011-12 ........................................................................ 37.7 34.4 8.7
2012-13 ........................................................................ 48.9 44.8 8.5
2013-14 ........................................................................ 61.9 60.8 1.8
2014-15 ........................................................................ 71.9 71.3 0.9
2015-16 ........................................................................ 84.4 84.4 0.1


-----

In an oversupplied market, we may decide to “bank” ROCs and sell them to suppliers for use in the following compliance
year; however, greater price discounting would be likely. Any oversupply of ROCs could therefore adversely affect our
business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The amount of the Ofgem recycle benefit fund payment that will be paid over to us is unpredictable and difficult to_**
**_forecast._**

The RO recycle benefit fund is made up of payments from suppliers who have not submitted enough ROCs to Ofgem
to meet their RO for the relevant compliance period and who therefore are required to pay the ROC buy-out price for each
ROC that they failed to procure. Its quantum therefore increases proportionally to the scarcity of ROCs in any given
compliance period. Many of our contracts for the sale of ROCs to suppliers contain provisions that require the supplier to pay
a fixed upfront fee and then an additional fee at a later date equal to the proportion of the recycle fund that is received by the
supplier from Ofgem following submission of the purchased ROCs.

In recent years it has become more challenging for DBEIS to forecast accurately the number of ROCs that may be
generated in a given compliance period due to the difficulty in predicting exactly when new renewable plants will come onstream and the amount of wind and solar electricity generation in any given period. If renewable output differs materially
from Ofgem’s expectations, more or fewer ROCs will have been generated during the compliance period than forecast, which
will affect the level of the recycle payment.

There is, therefore, inherent uncertainty in the amount of recycle benefit to which we will be entitled and any
significant fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We operate in a seasonable industry, which may affect our results of operations._**

Demand for electricity is seasonal, with demand and prices generally being higher during the winter months. Demand
for gas and wood pellets in the Retail segment is also dependent on weather, with periods of cold weather usually resulting in
an increase in demand.

In addition, revenue from the sale of ROCs is subject to annual patterns. Generators typically sell ROCs to suppliers for
delivery and payment in the months of June or July following the end of the relevant compliance period as suppliers need to
submit the ROCs to Ofgem by the end of August following the end of the compliance period. Therefore, the results of a
single financial half-year may not be a reliable basis for the expectations of a full fiscal year and may not be comparable with
the results in other financial half-years.

**_A failure of, or a malicious attack in relation to, our IT systems could adversely affect our reputation, business and results_**
**_of operations._**

We are highly dependent on our IT systems and networks and our operational performance could be materially
adversely affected by a failure to maintain the health of our IT systems and networks, with inadequate record keeping, poor
control of data and failure to support key technologies being among the key risks.

Attempts may be made to gain unauthorised access to, or deliberately breach, our IT systems in order, for example, to
manipulate our proprietary business data or customer information. Other examples include breaching of a licence agreement,
regulatory requirement or contractual obligation, and even incidents that do not amount to a breach could result in adverse
regulatory and financial consequences, as well as harming our reputation.

In addition to these risks, we may be affected by other potential events that are largely outside our control. Malicious
attacks, including cyber-attacks, may damage our assets, prevent generation at the Power Station or otherwise significantly
affect corporate activities and, as a consequence, have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Our Retail segment requires access to sensitive customer data. Examples of sensitive customer data include names,
addresses, bank account information, historical electricity consumption, payment history, credit and debit card numbers. If a
significant or widely publicised disclosure of customer data were to occur, whether as a result of a failure of our IT security
systems, employee negligence or the actions of our vendors, the reputation of our Retail segment may be adversely affected,
customer confidence may be diminished and we may be subject to legal claims, fines or other disciplinary action. We may be
also liable for violation of data privacy and protection regulations in such case.

As our business grows, our information security capability will need to be expanded and improved to accommodate the
businesses’ increasingly complex and demanding requirements. Failure to make these improvements in an efficient and
timely manner could have a detrimental impact on our systems or networks availability or efficiency, leading to a material
adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.


-----

**_Failures of our IT systems for our Retail segment may negatively impact future business development and adversely affect_**
**_our existing customer base._**

Our Retail segment, Haven Power and the Opus Group, depends on its respective IT systems for regulatory
compliance, such as the effective and compliant roll-out of Smart Meters to customers. See “Our business is subject to
_complex regulations by the Government, the EU and other authorities that have in the past and could in the future materially_
_adversely affect us”._

Haven Power is currently replacing the majority of its ageing, complex IT systems with a new system stack. There can
be no assurance that the replacement of the existing IT system will be completed as planned and we may incur substantial
additional costs in relation to the replacement of Haven Power’s existing IT systems. In addition, there can be no assurance
that the new IT system will deliver the expected efficiencies and improvements. Any failings in the implementation of the
new IT systems in Haven Power or any failings in the existing IT architecture of Haven Power or the Opus Group may
adversely affect the customer experience in these companies and their ability to comply with their regulatory obligations.
Such occurrences may have a material adverse effect on Haven Power or the Opus Group’s ability to retain and develop its
customer base and may adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our inability to attract, train or retain appropriately qualified personnel could adversely affect our business._**

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees and contractors. The need for such
employees is particularly enhanced in light of the current pace of strategic change we are experiencing. The unplanned
departure of any of our executive officers or key employees could have a negative impact on our operations, including
possibly adversely affecting our ability to provide the service levels our customers expect.

This risk is particularly true with respect to electricity regulation and the renewable energy industry. Electricity
regulation and trading is a highly specialised field with a limited pool of qualified and experienced personnel while the
renewable energy industry is a highly specialised and relatively new industry and, as a result, there is a limited pool of
technically qualified personnel, particularly outside London. We compete with a number of companies as well as
Government entities and other organisations for such personnel and, consequently, we have encountered and may continue to
encounter difficulties in retaining certain key employees and attracting new personnel. Any such difficulty in retaining and/or
attracting key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We also deem the calibre and performance of the Opus Group’s key employees to be particularly important to the
success of the Opus Group’s contribution to us. While we have taken action to ensure the retention of certain key employees
of the Opus Group, there can be no assurance that the Opus Acquisition will not result in the unplanned departure of such key
employees, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We are dependent on good working relations with our employees, unions and employee representatives to avoid business_**
**_interruptions or amend collective bargaining agreements._**

As of 31 December 2016, approximately 60 per cent. of the employees of Drax Power (the owner of the Power Station)
were covered by collective bargaining arrangements. If we were to make any changes to the terms of employment of any of
our employees or to terminate employment agreements of our employees and our employees were to react adversely to such
changes or terminations, we may face labour disputes or work stoppages at the Power Station. The operations at the Power
Station have not recently been adversely affected by disputes with employees, contractors or trade unions. However, we can
give no assurance that future industrial action may not disrupt our operations.

**_We may suffer damages as a result of our employees or agents acting outside applicable law or regulation or our policies_**
**_and procedures._**

We may suffer damage if an employee or someone acting on our behalf, for example TPIs, breaches our internal
controls or internal governance framework or contravenes applicable laws and regulations. Such breach or circumvention
may include, for example, inadvertent or careless mistakes or intentional acts or misrepresentations by our employees or
agents, breaches of applicable laws or regulations in the course of their duties, breaches of operational guidelines or other
improper acts. Any such misconduct could have an impact on our reputation and our relationship with our regulators and
other stakeholders or lead to regulatory or legal action, which in turn could adversely affect our business, operations,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The customers, suppliers, contractors and other third-parties that we do business with may not fulfil their obligations to us_**
**_and may expose us to credit and operational risks._**

Customers, suppliers, financial institutions and others with whom we do business may not satisfy their obligations,
which could adversely affect our financial position.


-----

_Credit risk_

We purchase from and sell commodities to a range of counterparties in a number of different countries. Collateral is not
required from all counterparties and the failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform its contractual obligations
might lead to reduced profits for us or result in us incurring additional costs in replacing the relevant transactions. We may
also find ourselves unable to procure or sell replacement commodities elsewhere.

We have two major customers in our Generation segment. We derived revenues of £541.5 million and £399.3 million
in 2016 and £597.7 million and £468.0 million in 2015 from our top two customers in the Generation segment, representing
approximately 18 per cent. and 13 per cent. respectively, of our consolidated revenue in 2016 and 2015. A default by one of
these customers could lead to a substantial loss of revenue and adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations.

The failure of one or more of the large customers in our Retail segment (who are generally not required to deliver
collateral in respect of their contractual obligations), particularly I&C customers of Haven Power, may lead to reduced profits
for us, particularly if the power then needs to be sold in the market at a lower price than that previously contracted.

We are also exposed to the credit risk of banks that hold our deposits and of financial counterparties with whom we
hedge foreign exchange, commodity price, interest rate or inflation rate exposures. These exposures are routinely hedged up
to five years ahead and so any default or insolvency of a counterparty in circumstances where the mark-to-market exposure is
in that counterparty’s favour could lead to unexpected termination payments payable by us and an inability to obtain
sufficient replacement currency to enable us to meet our liabilities in a particular jurisdiction on a timely basis.

_Operational counterparty risk_

The nascent nature of the biomass supply market means that our third-party biomass suppliers do not have the same
financial strength as our coal suppliers. There is an increased risk that these biomass suppliers may default on their supply
obligations and, in such circumstances, the potential for us to recover our losses as a result of a supplier default may be
remote.

**_We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and our business and results of operations may be negatively affected_**
**_by fluctuation of different currencies._**

Our business is subject to risks due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Most of the biomass we purchase is
priced in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars or euro. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar or euro in relation to
each other, or relative to other currencies (including the pound sterling), may increase our suppliers’ cost of business and
ultimately our cost of goods sold with respect to biomass. As such, our failure or inability to hedge currency exchange rate
risks within our expected five-year hedging period (see “Our _Business—Generation—Trading sustainable biomass units”) or_
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond this period could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our financial models may be flawed and inaccurate._**

We use a number of financial models to manage our business and there is a risk that the financial models used by us to
calculate important information such as generation forecasts and fuel pricing models, optimisation of fuel deliveries and
infrastructure investment may produce inaccurate information. This could be due to a model itself being incorrect or
corrupted, or the assumptions that we use in a model being inaccurate. Such failures could adversely affect our business,
operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance policies may not provide cover for all losses incurred and we may not be able to maintain the same level of_**
**_insurance cover in the future._**

Our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, such as explosions, fire, severe weather
conditions, toxic emissions and equipment breakdowns. This risk is particularly acute because the majority of our revenue
and all of our gross profit for 2016 was derived from the sale of electricity produced and ROCs earned by the Power Station.
As protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance cover against some, but not all, of the potential losses which
may arise. There is no assurance that catastrophic or other events relating to uninsured or uninsurable risks will not occur.
Furthermore, if we suffer a loss in relation to an insured risk, there is no guarantee that the amount of insurance protection to
which we would be contractually entitled will be sufficient to cover the entire loss incurred. Insurance, warranties or
performance guarantees may not cover all or any lost revenues or increased expenses from business interruptions or other
events. If we suffer an uninsured or underinsured loss, this could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations.

We currently have a claim under our business interruption insurance for lost revenue arising from reduced generation
due to a longer than anticipated planned outage of one our biomass generation units and other unplanned outages reducing


-----

the availability of the Power Station’s biomass generation units in the second half of 2016 (see “Our _Business—Generation—_
_Availability”). The claim is still outstanding and there can be no assurances that the root cause analysis supporting the claim_
will be sufficient to enable the claim to proceed, nor that the quantum of any successful claim will be of the quantum
originally claimed.

Insurance cover for particular risks or limits of indemnity may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms or cost. It is possible that in the future that insurance providers may no longer wish to insure businesses in the biomass
or coal industry against certain risks, or may charge generators significantly higher premiums for such cover. Moreover, if
the Power Station were to suffer an insured loss, the insurance proceeds received by us might not be sufficient to cover the
business loss, or to repair and reinstate the affected facilities, or to satisfy liabilities to third-parties. The occurrence of an
event that is not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We may be required to pay increased pension contributions to our pension schemes in the future._**

We maintain a variety of pension schemes, including a defined benefit scheme. We and our pension scheme trustees
aim to meet the defined benefit liabilities from cash contributions from Drax Power, the sponsoring company, in respect of
ongoing benefit accrual and deficit repair contributions, and with a portfolio of investments. These investments give rise to
associated risks relating to interest rates, inflation, returns on assets and the longevity of scheme members and a mismatch
between asset and liability value movements as a consequence of targeting higher returns than those available from assets
effectively matching the liabilities. The defined benefit scheme’s investment portfolio contains a proportion of assets that are
expected to provide a better return in the long term than alternative investments such as bonds; however, in the short term,
the difference between the value of liabilities and assets may vary significantly, potentially resulting in an increase in the
funding requirements.

The current business environment, with low long-term interest and inflation rates, long-term gilt yields, corporate bond
yields, equity values and credit spreads could also affect the value of the deficit having to be recognised. Furthermore, a
quicker than expected increase in life expectancy and/or employee pensionable salaries increasing above the rates assumed in
the previous scheme valuation could be expected to increase the defined benefit liabilities. Further changes in the accounting
standards relating to defined benefit pension liabilities could also lead to an increasing deficit arising in our defined benefit
pension scheme. As of 31 December 2016, our defined benefit pension scheme had a deficit of £30.1 million. As of
31 December 2016, a decrease of 0.25 per cent. in the discount rate or inflation rate would have resulted in an increase in our
net liability under the defined benefit scheme of £16.2 million and £13.6 million, respectively. Also, as of 31 December
2016, an increase in life expectancy by one year would have resulted in an increase in our net liability under the defined
benefit pension scheme of £11.0 million.

Our defined benefit pension scheme is subject to triennial actuarial valuations, the latest having been undertaken as of
31 March 2016. The level of funding deficit calculated at the time could, subject to agreement between us and the pension
scheme trustees, result in additional deficit repair contributions being required or possibly us offering more contingent assets
or asset-backed contributions as further security. Any requirement to make significant immediate cash contributions into our
defined benefit scheme to cover any such deficit could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations. The trustees of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (the “Pension Trustees”)
currently benefit from second-ranking security over the Power Station and certain other of our UK assets. The existing
second-ranking security is subject to substantially the same limitations that would be imposed by the Pension Trustee Priority
Deed. In addition, the existing second-ranking security provides for a prohibition on the incurrence of additional debt (other
than under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and certain debt issued to refinance previously issued debt) if the
incurrence of such debt would be expected to result in the credit ratings of our outstanding senior indebtedness to fall below
BB- (in the case of S&P) or Ba3 (in the case of Moody’s).

Unanticipated actions by the pension regulator and/or any material revisions to existing pensions legislation could
require accelerated and increased contributions to our defined benefit scheme which may restrict our financial flexibility. The
pension scheme trustees could also seek accelerated and increased contributions should we plan to make material disposals or
raise additional debt. This could adversely affect our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may become involved in legal proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial_**
**_condition, results of operation and cash flows._**

We may become involved in a variety of legal proceedings based on, for example, environmental, health, safety, land
use issues and other matters. These may include complaints and statutory nuisance actions and claims by third-parties based
on their common law rights. Such complaints and actions may be related to issues such as odour, emission and other such
nuisances at our Power Station or wood pellet manufacturing facility sites. These types of lawsuits are often lengthy and can


-----

be expensive to defend. A successful third-party claim could materially hinder our operations, prejudice our reputation and
result in the imposition of penalties or substantial damages.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position, including our
effective tax rate or tax payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations.
There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax
position is challenged by the relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we
currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our
costs of operations or our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATED TO THE NOTES, THE GUARANTEES AND OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE**

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Collateral described in this Offering
Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging
obligations (including our obligations under the Secured Trading Line). Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
our obligations under the New Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including our obligations under the Secured
Trading Line) will have priority with respect to the application of the proceeds from any enforcement action over the
Collateral and certain distressed disposals of the Collateral. The Collateral may also secure additional debt or other
obligations with such priority to or ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on
the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the New Senior Facilities or such other credit facility and such secured
hedging obligations (including outstanding claims under the Secured Trading Line) are greater than the proceeds realised.
Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the New Senior
Facilities or such other credit facility and such secured hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured
Trading Line) have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other debt
or obligations secured by the Collateral entitled to be repaid with the proceeds thereof on a pari passu basis.

No appraisals have been prepared by or on our behalf in connection with the issuance of the Notes. The fair market
value of the Collateral and the amount able to be realised upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many
factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the
availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action
or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral.
The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realisable value for such assets. All or a portion of
the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there
will be a market for the sale of the Collateral or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay during
liquidation. In addition, the share pledges or charges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency
or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that security interests and other rights granted to other parties that are not a party to the Intercreditor
Agreement encumber assets owned by the Issuer or Guarantors that do not comprise the Collateral, those parties have or may
exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their security interests or other rights that could adversely
affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes to realise the value
of or enforce that Collateral. For example, the trustees of our defined benefit pension scheme will be granted second-ranking
security over the Collateral. As of 31 December 2016, our defined benefit pension scheme had a deficit £30.1 million. While
the pension trustees will enter into certain contractual arrangements with DGHL pursuant to which, among other things, they
undertake not to enforce their second ranking security without the Security Agent’s consent prior to the discharge of the
Notes and certain other indebtedness secured over the Collateral, the pension trustees will not be party to the Intercreditor
Agreement. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, holders of the
Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against
the Issuer’s and (assuming that the relevant Guarantees have not been released) the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of
these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds
realised upon enforcement of the Collateral.

The Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favour of the holders of the Notes on the
Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third-parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, such holders
or third-parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds


-----

available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of
such additional Notes would benefit from the same Collateral as the holders of the relevant Notes being offered hereby,
thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the Collateral for the Notes.

**_The value of the Collateral may decrease because of wear and tear, obsolescence, impairment or certain casualty events._**

The value of the assets serving as Collateral for the Notes may be adversely affected by normal wear and tear,
obsolescence, impairment or because of certain events that may cause damage to these assets. The Issuer and the Guarantors
will not be required to improve the Collateral. Furthermore, the value of the Collateral is significantly influenced by the
usefulness of the assets serving as Collateral for our business operations. If any of the assets serving as Collateral would
become obsolete, for example as a result of new technological standards or changes in the applicable regulatory regime, this
would have a significant negative impact on the value of the relevant Collateral.

By nature of our operations, the Collateral is subject to the risk of certain casualty events. The proceeds of any
insurance with respect to the Collateral taken out may not be sufficient to rebuild or restore such properties to their original
condition prior to the occurrence of the events that caused the insured damages. In addition, there are certain events that are
either not insurable or not economically insurable.

**_The rights of holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and
priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or unable to take the
actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent will have any
obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any such security interest. Absent perfection, the Security Agent, on behalf of
the holders of Notes, may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition
with third-parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral.

**_The granting or the release and retake of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, the New Senior Facilities and the
hedging obligations secured on the Collateral (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) may create
hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. Furthermore, the Indenture will permit the Issuer, DGHL
and the other Guarantors to retake and release security over the Collateral in certain circumstances, including in connection
with the incurrence of future indebtedness, the transfer of Collateral within the Group and the implementation of certain
corporate reorganisations. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each
new security interest has been granted or re-granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, regranted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such
jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

**_The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the obligations of
the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes, but will be granted only in
favour of the Security Agent. The Trustee for the Notes will be a party to the Intercreditor Agreement between, among others,
the Security Agent and creditors or representatives of the creditors of the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral,
including the New Senior Facilities and the counterparties to certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the
Secured Trading Line). Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in the future. Among other things,
the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Security Documents, the sharing in any recoveries from such
enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have
direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes,
except through the Security Agent, who will follow instructions as set forth under the caption “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. In addition, in certain circumstances, lenders under the New Senior_
Facilities Agreement will have the right to direct the Security Agent in enforcement actions with respect to the Collateral.

**_Creditors under the New Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured_**
**_Trading Line) and other priority debt are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement_**
**_sale in priority to the Notes._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by the same Collateral securing the
obligations under the New Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured
Trading Line). In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, subject to certain restrictions, we will be permitted to incur


-----

significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral and that may be entitled
to be repaid with the proceeds thereof on a priority or pari passu basis, including other credit facilities and certain hedging
obligations.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the New Senior Facilities and any other super priority
indebtedness (subject to the incurrence of additional indebtedness permitted by the Indenture) and certain hedging obligations
(including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in
any enforcement sale or certain distressed disposals in priority to the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. As a result, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated_
to the rights of our existing and future secured creditors who have priority in respect of the proceeds from enforcement of the
liens over assets that constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of
the Collateral, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the New
Senior Facilities Agreement, any such other priority indebtedness and such secured hedging obligations (including the
obligations under the Secured Trading Line) are greater than the proceeds realised. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of
the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the New Senior Facilities, any such other priority indebtedness
and such secured hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) have been discharged from
such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral that are
entitled to be repaid with the proceeds thereof on a pari passu basis. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is
secured by the Collateral and that may be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds thereof on a priority or pari passu basis with
the Notes, the recoveries in respect of the proceeds of the Collateral by holders of Notes will be diluted commensurate with
the amount of indebtedness we incur.

**_Holders of the Notes will not control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances._**

The Trustee under the Indenture governing the Notes will on the Issue Date be a party to the Intercreditor Agreement
between, among others, the agent under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, the counterparties under the Secured Trading
Line, certain other hedge counterparties and the Security Agent. Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor
Agreement or we may enter into additional intercreditor agreements in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor
Agreement governs the enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral, the sharing in any recoveries from such
enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders
under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, the counterparties under the Secured Trading Line, certain other hedge
counterparties and holders of any permitted future shared security indebtedness, will act to enforce the security interest in the
Collateral and take instructions from the secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only as provided for in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The provisions governing enforcement of the Collateral are described in “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Restrictions on Enforcement and Permitted Enforcement”._

The arrangements regarding enforcement of the Collateral could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a
number of respects. For example, other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement
action against the Issuer, DGHL or its subsidiaries prior to any action taken by the Security Agent, the Issuer, DGHL or one
or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could
otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. For example, the trustees of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme will be
granted second-ranking security over the Collateral. As of 31 December 2016, our defined benefit pension scheme had a
deficit of £30.1 million. While the pension trustees will enter into certain contractual arrangements with DGHL pursuant to
which, among other things, they undertake not to enforce their second ranking security without the Security Agent’s consent
prior to the discharge of the Notes and certain other indebtedness secured over the Collateral, the pension trustees will not be
party to the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness that may be secured on the Collateral, the holders of the
Notes may not comprise the majority of the senior secured creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent.
Further, if the obligations of the priority creditors have not been satisfied within six months of the date any proposed
enforcement instruction is first given to the Security Agent, control of the enforcement proceedings will shift to the super
priority creditors. The lenders under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, the counterparties under the Secured Trading Line,
certain other hedge counterparties and lenders or creditors of future classes of debt that are permitted to share the security
granted in favour of the Notes may have interests that are different from the interest of the holders of the Notes and may,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue remedies under the Security Documents at a time or in a
manner that is not supported by the holders of the Notes. In connection with the enforcement of the Collateral or certain
distressed disposals of the Collateral, the Collateral and the guarantees of the Notes may be released in circumstances where
the holders of the Notes do not recover any proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral or such distressed disposal
proceeds or recover only a limited amount of proceeds.


-----

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have
any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By
accepting the Notes, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions,
holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes_**
**_and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without the consent of the holders of the Notes or the consent of the_**
**_Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including:

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (i) a person that is not DGHL or a Restricted
Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “Description of_
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary_
that is not a Guarantor, provided that, in the case of (ii) after giving pro forma effect to such release, DGHL and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will be in compliance with sub-paragraph (2) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;

    - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release
of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

    - as described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Amendments and Waivers”;

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided under “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Defeasance” and “Description of Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

    - if DGHL designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

    - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including upon an
enforcement action;

    - in connection with the granting of liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the sale of such
property or assets, which may include Collateral, pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Financing (as defined under
“Description of Notes—Certain Definitions”);

    - as permitted by the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—No Impairment of
_Security Interest”;_

    - to release and/or re-take any lien on any Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture,
the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including as part
of any Permitted Reorganisation;

    - pursuant to the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Limitations on Liens”; or_

    - as otherwise permitted under the Indenture.

See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens”.

Under various circumstances, the Subsidiary Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

    - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant
Subsidiary Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant
described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”
and the Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of DGHL as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

    - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as described under “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Defeasance” and “Description of Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_


-----

    - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including upon an
enforcement action;

    - as described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Amendments and Waivers”;

    - as described in the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;

    - upon written notice from DGHL to the Trustee, so long as no event of default under the Indenture is continuing;
_provided that, after giving pro forma effect to such release, DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries are in compliance_
with the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;

    - as a result of any transaction permitted by the covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”; or_

    - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

Under various circumstances, the Guarantee of DGHL will be released automatically, including:

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Defeasance” and “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

    - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including upon an
enforcement action;

    - as described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Amendments and Waivers”;

    - as a result of any transaction permitted by “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;
or

    - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

See “Description of Notes—Note Guarantees—Releases of Note Guarantees”.

**_The Issuer, the Guarantors and Drax Group plc will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents governing the Collateral will allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and Drax Group plc to remain
in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the
Collateral securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer,
the Guarantors and Drax Group plc may, among other things, without any release or consent by either Security Agent,
conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, securitisation, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The Issuer is a special purpose finance subsidiary of DGHL with no business operations and will depend on cash from_**
**_Drax Corporate Limited and Drax Corporate Limited’s direct and indirect subsidiaries to be able to make payments on the_**
**_Notes._**

The Issuer is a special purpose finance subsidiary of DGHL and was formed in connection with facilitating the
Refinancing. The Issuer has no subsidiaries and conducts no business or revenue-generating operations of its own and will
have no material assets other than its interests in the Proceeds Loans. The Issuer’s ability to make payments pursuant to the
Notes and Guarantees is therefore dependent on the interest or other payments it receives pursuant to the Proceeds Loans. If
Drax Corporate Limited (or any successor borrower) does not make payments under the Proceeds Loans for whatever reason,
the Issuer does not expect to have any other sources of funds available to it that would permit it to make payments pursuant
to the Notes.

In addition, the borrower under the Proceeds Loans, Drax Corporate Limited, is a holding company with no
independent revenue-generating business operations or significant assets other than investments in its subsidiaries. Drax
Corporate Limited depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including
payments owed under the Proceeds Loans. If our operating subsidiaries do not distribute cash to Drax Corporate Limited to
make scheduled payments to the Issuer on the Proceeds Loans, we do not expect Drax Corporate Limited to have any other
source of funds that would allow it to make payments on the Proceeds Loans. Various agreements governing our debt may
restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within the restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such
payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of Drax Corporate Limited’s subsidiaries
will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. The inability to
transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that even though the entities, in aggregate,
may have sufficient resources to meet the obligations under the Proceeds Loans and the Notes, they may not be permitted to


-----

make the necessary dividends or distributions from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted
group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

In such circumstances, Holders would have to rely upon claims for payment under the Guarantees and on all available
security. However, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that following the occurrence of an acceleration of any of the classes
of debt secured by the Collateral and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, payments in respect of the Notes and the
Guarantees will be prohibited except from enforcement proceeds of the Collateral or any pro rata distribution or dividend out
of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s unsecured assets. In addition, such payments are subject to the risks and limitations described
herein.

**_Each Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that following the occurrence of an acceleration of any of the classes of debt secured by the
Collateral and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, payments in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees will be prohibited
except from enforcement proceeds of the Collateral or any pro rata distribution or dividend out of the Issuer’s or a
Guarantor’s unsecured assets. In addition, the Issuer, the Guarantors and Drax Group plc will secure payment of the Notes by
granting security under the relevant Security Documents. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document
will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to such Security Document, and the
Indenture will provide that each Guarantee and security interest granted by a Guarantor will be limited to the maximum
amount that can be secured by the Issuer and the Guarantors without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest
voidable or otherwise ineffective under English, United States or other applicable law and enforcement of each Guarantee
and security interest against the Issuer and the Guarantors will be subject to certain generally available defences. These laws
and defences include those that relate to insolvency, voidable preference, fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance,
corporate purpose or benefit, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalisation and defences affecting the rights of creditors
generally. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees _and_
_Security”._

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a
court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes or any
security interests; (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under the relevant Guarantee or realised
from the enforcement of the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the
relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to holders of the Notes,
typically if the court found that:

    - the relevant Guarantee was incurred or the relevant security interest was granted with actual intent to give
preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or
security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee or security interest has the effect of
giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent
when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest;

    - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate
benefit for the relevant Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider: (i) was insolvent or
rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was undercapitalised or became
undercapitalised because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it
would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

    - the relevant Guarantee or security interest was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or security
provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider; or

    - the amounts paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security
Document were in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee or security interest granted by any of our subsidiaries
pursuant to the Indenture.

There can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider
was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor
or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor
or security provider was insolvent on the date the Guarantee was issued or the relevant security interest granted, that
payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee of the Notes and the enforcement proceeds under each Security
Document will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or security interest not constituting a preference,


-----

fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as
to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security
provider. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability
under the relevant Note Guarantee or Security Document may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Guarantee or security interest was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided
such Guarantee or security interest, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, a holder of the Notes may cease to have any
claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or Collateral and would be an unsecured creditor solely of the Issuer and, if
applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any
Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations
apply, the relevant Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if a Guarantor
cannot satisfy its obligations under the relevant Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or is otherwise set aside, the Issuer cannot assure you that it can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under
the Notes. In the event that any security interest is void or unenforceable, claims of holders of the Notes would be effectively
subordinated to other claims against the relevant security provider that are secured over the relevant Collateral and up to the
value of such Collateral.

**_The Notes and each of the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to present and future liabilities of DGHL’s non-_**
**_Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of DGHL’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, which means that the holders of the Notes will
have no direct claims against the assets or earnings of such non-Guarantor subsidiaries to satisfy obligations due under the
Notes or the Guarantees. For the year ended 31 December 2016, after giving pro forma effect to the Opus Acquisition, the
Guarantors generated £303.9 million representing 100 per cent., of the Group’s Pro Forma CfD Adjusted EBITDA. As of 31
December 2016, the total assets of the Guarantors (other than Guarantors that were members of the Opus Group at that date)
were £3,443.0 million (excluding goodwill), representing 100 per cent. of the Group’s total assets excluding goodwill of
£14.5 million as of that date. As of 31 December 2016, the total assets of the Guarantors that were members of the Opus
Group at that date were £179 million (calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding intra-group items, goodwill and
investments in subsidiaries of Opus), representing 100 per cent. of the Opus Group’s total assets excluding goodwill as of
31 December 2016. Any of DGHL’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes do not have any obligations to pay amounts
due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Accordingly, you should only rely on the Guarantees to provide
credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor
subsidiary, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of such subsidiary, will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiary over the claims of creditors of such non-Guarantor’s parent entity,
including claims by holders of the Notes under the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation, administration, reorganisation or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding of any of DGHL’s non-Guarantor
subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from
the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to the direct or indirect shareholders of
such entity, including DGHL and the Guarantors. As such, the Notes, each Guarantee and the Proceeds Loans will each be
structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of DGHL’s nonGuarantor subsidiaries. The covenants in the Notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes and in the future the revenues and EBITDA of such entities could increase, possibly substantially.

**_The claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of our existing and future secured_**
**_creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness do not also secure the Notes._**

The claims of any secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with
respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be
effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness.

**_Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to operate the business, react to changes in the_**
**_economy or in the industry and pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments._**

We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service obligations. We cannot assure you that we will generate enough
cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations. As at 31 December 2016, after giving pro forma effect to the Opus
Acquisition and the Refinancing, we would have had total financial indebtedness of £597.1 million, including £550.0 million
under the Notes. In addition, as at 31 December 2016, on an adjusted basis giving effect to the Refinancing, we would have
£268.9 million available for drawing under the New Senior Facilities Agreement. Our exposure under our hedging
obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line and other secured hedging) will also fluctuate from
time to time and could be substantial. There is no limitation in the Indenture to our incurrence of certain hedging obligations.
For further details, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of Notes”. We anticipate that our


-----

leverage will continue to be in place for the foreseeable future. Our leverage could have important consequences for our
business and operations, and therefore for holders of the Notes offered hereby, including:

    - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and other indebtedness and
liabilities;

    - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

    - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

    - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry
conditions;

    - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness,
thereby limiting cash flow available to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or
other general corporate requirements;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in tax regulations, our business and the industry;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly
leveraged;

    - compromising our ability to capitalise on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared
with our competitors due to the maintenance covenants in some of our debt instruments; and

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing, or negatively impacting the terms of such financing, to fund
future working capital, capital expenditures, joint ventures, other general corporate requirements and acquisitions.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt
obligations, including the obligations under the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and
to fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future operating performance and ability to
generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic,
competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations nor obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures.
For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations of Drax of Drax—Liquidity and Capital Resources”._

**_You may face interest rate risks by investing in the Notes, as certain of our borrowings bear, and the Floating Rate Notes_**
**_and the New Revolving Facility will bear, interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost_**
**_and reducing cash flow._**

A substantial portion of our indebtedness, including the New Revolving Facility and the Floating Rate Notes bear or
will bear interest at a variable rate that is based on LIBOR or EURIBOR plus an agreed margin and certain additional costs.
Furthermore, we may incur additional indebtedness that bears interest at a floating rate. LIBOR, EURIBOR and/or any other
floating interest rate applicable to such indebtedness could rise significantly in the future. Fluctuations in LIBOR, EURIBOR
and/or any other floating rate interest, or the occurrence of certain events (as defined in the relevant debt facility) may
increase our overall interest burden and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our debt obligations. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Facilities Agreement” and “Description of Notes”.

**_Despite current indebtedness levels, our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate_**
**_the risks associated with our leverage._**

The terms of the Indenture will permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, significant amounts
of which may be secured and share in the Collateral securing the Notes. Certain creditors in respect of our indebtedness,
including lenders under the New Senior Facilities Agreement and counterparties under certain hedging obligations (including
obligations under the Secured Trading Line) will receive proceeds from the enforcement of security granted over the
Collateral prior to the holders of the Notes. In addition, the Indenture will allow our non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur
additional debt that would be structurally senior to the Notes and will not prevent us from incurring liabilities that do not
constitute “Indebtedness” as defined thereunder. Although the agreements governing our debt instruments contain restrictions
on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and
the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Our exposure under our hedging
obligations (including obligations under the Secured Trading Line and other secured hedging) will also fluctuate from time to
time and could be substantial. There is no limitations in the Indenture to our incurrence of certain hedging obligations. If we
incur additional debt above the levels currently in effect, the risks associated with our leverage, including those described
above, would increase.


-----

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control,_**
**_and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. Our ability to make interest or principal
payments on or to refinance its debt obligations, including the New Senior Facilities and our obligations under the Note as
well as our hedging obligations (including obligations under the Secured Trading Line) will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in part, to general
economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our significant
leverage may also make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and exposes us to interest
rate increases to the extent any of our variable rate debt (such as the New Revolving Facility and the Floating Rate Notes) is
not hedged.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt obligations, and
additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when
due, or to refinance such debts, including the Notes. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are
insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

     - sell assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the New Senior Facilities and the Notes, on or before
maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all.

If any of the above were to occur, the holders of our debt may be able to accelerate our debt and, to the extent such debt
is secured, foreclose on our assets. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other
capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable
terms, if at all. In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at
such time. See “Risk Factors Relating to The Business—Our results from operations are dependent on our exposure to UK
_wholesale electricity prices and the UK economy”. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our_
current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business. The terms
of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis
would likely result in the downgrading of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In
the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to
dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness,
including the Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and to use the proceeds from any such disposition. We
may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that we could have realised from the proceeds of such
dispositions, and any proceeds we do realise from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service
obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service
obligations.

Furthermore, any downgrading of our credit rating could harm our ability to engage in commodity or other hedging
transactions, which are an important part of our operations, or else require us to post increased amounts of collateral in
support of such transactions. If we were unable to engage in hedging transactions on terms that were acceptable to us or at all,
this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operation.

**_Restrictive covenants in the New Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture may restrict our ability to operate our_**
**_business._**

The Indenture and our New Senior Facilities Agreement will contain negative covenants restricting our ability to,
among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred stock;

    - make certain payments, including dividends and other restricted payments;

    - create, permit to exist or incur liens;

    - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participation in joint ventures;


-----

    - agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions;

    - engage in sales, leases or transfers of certain assets and subsidiary stock;

     - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

    - transfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions;

    - engage in certain activities (with respect to the Issuer);

    - impair the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

    - create Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

All of these limitations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of Notes—Certain
_Covenants”. Our compliance with these covenants could reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations, particularly by:_

    - affecting our ability to react to changes in market conditions, whether by increasing our vulnerability in relation to
unfavourable economic conditions or by preventing us from profiting from an improvement in those conditions;

    - affecting our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest;

    - limiting our ability to obtain certain additional financing in order to meet our working capital requirements, make
investments or acquisitions and carry out refinancings; and

    - forcing us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows to payment of the sums due on our indebtedness, thus
reducing our ability to utilise our cash flow for other purposes.

In addition, certain of our financing arrangements, including the New Senior Facilities Agreement and the Opus
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, require us or certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain additional negative
covenants. The New Senior Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with customary negative covenants, subject to certain
agreed exceptions, including, but not limited to, (i) restrictions on change of business, (ii) restrictions on change of centre of
main interests, (iii) restrictions on change of share capital, (iv) restrictions on the purchase or redemption of the Notes,
(v) restrictions on the activities of DGHL, (vi) restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness by non-obligor
subsidiaries, (vii) restrictions on certain disposals of assets to non-obligor subsidiaries, (viii) restrictions on change to Drax
Group plc’s or DGHL’s year end, and (ix) restrictions on the parameters of the Secured Trade Line. The Opus Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement contains certain negative undertakings that are customary for debt facilities of this nature, subject
to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions. These include, but are not limited to, restrictions on (i) mergers,
(ii) change of business, (iii) change to centre of main interest, (iv) acquisitions, (v) joint ventures, (vi) creation of security
interests, (vii) disposals, (viii) loans, (ix) guarantees or indemnities, (x) financial indebtedness, (xi) issuance or redemption of
share capital, and (xii) treasury transactions.

The New Senior Facilities Agreement also requires us to observe certain affirmative undertakings and a financial
covenant, and the Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires the Opus Group to observe certain affirmative
undertakings and financial covenants. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Facilities
_Agreement—Undertaking and Covenants”._

**_If we fail to meet our obligations under our financing agreements, our creditors could declare all amounts owed to them_**
**_due and payable, which could lead to liquidity constraints._**

Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our debt instruments may be affected by events beyond our
control. These include general economic, financial and industry-related factors and conditions. If we breach any of the
aforementioned covenants or restrictions, it could be in default under the Notes, the New Senior Facilities Agreement and
other relevant financing agreements.

In the event of a default under the Notes, the New Senior Facilities Agreement or any other debt facility agreement, the
lenders or creditors under the respective facilities or financing instruments could take certain actions, including terminating
their commitments, if any, and declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit facilities and other indebtedness
to be due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, borrowings under other debt instruments
that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes and the New Senior Facilities Agreement,
may as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable.

If the debt under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, the Notes or any other material financing arrangement that we
have entered into or will subsequently enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay the Notes in
full. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our obligations under
the Notes in such an event.


-----

**_The Issuer may not be able to finance a change of control offer._**

The Indenture will require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, if
DGHL experiences certain change of control events. The Issuer’s failure to effect a change of control offer when required
would constitute an event of default under the Indenture. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase any Notes as may be required by
the Indenture will depend on our access to funds at such time, and we may not be able to secure access to enough cash to
finance the repurchase. In addition, the New Senior Facilities Agreement, other indebtedness of the Group, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may restrict our ability to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
following the occurrence of such a change of control event. A change of control event may result in an event of default under,
acceleration of, or obligation to mandatorily prepay, the New Senior Facilities Agreement and other indebtedness. The
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a change of control offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the
change of control event itself does not.

**_In certain circumstances, a change of control offer is not required to be made._**

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford holders of the Notes protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a re-organisation, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, because such corporate events may not involve a shift
in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the
Indenture. Except as described under “Description of Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions
that would require the Issuer to offer to purchase or redeem the relevant Notes in the event of a re-organisation, restructuring,
merger, recapitalisation or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
properties or assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person, other than a Subsidiary of Drax
Group plc, Drax Group plc or a parent entity. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or
substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all
or substantially all” of DGHL’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ assets and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change
of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make a Change of Control offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Under certain circumstances, following a tender offer or offer to purchase the Notes, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem_**
**_all of the remaining Notes of non-tendering holders._**

If, pursuant to any tender offer or other offer to purchase all of the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes, holders
of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of the relevant series validly tender and
do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture will permit the Issuer, or any third-party on behalf of the Issuer, at its option, to
redeem the remaining outstanding Notes of that series at a price equivalent to the highest price paid pursuant to such tender
offer or offer to purchase (excluding any early tender premium). As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to
surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to the highest price paid to tendering holders, including if such
price is below par, and may not receive the return holders of the Notes expect to receive on the Notes. See “Description of
_Notes—Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers”._

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to resell the Notes easily, an active liquid trading market for the Notes may not_**
**_develop or may be volatile and no assurance can be made regarding the prices at which holders of the Notes might be able_**
**_to resell the Notes._**

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no existing market. Although we will apply to list the Notes
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to have them admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or will remain listed. In addition, we cannot
assure you that an active or liquid trading market will develop for any series of Notes or the prices at which holders of the
relevant series of Notes would be able to sell Notes. Further liquidity will depend on, among other things, the number of
holders of the relevant series of Notes, our financial performance, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities
and the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Notes. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield
securities and changes in our financial performance or in the markets where we operate may adversely affect the liquidity of
the trading market in each series of Notes and the market price quoted for each series of Notes. As a result, we cannot assure
you that an active trading market will actually develop for the Notes or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained.

Moreover, the price and trading volume of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes may be highly volatile.
Factors such as variations in our revenue, earnings and cash flows and proposals for new investments, strategic alliances
and/or acquisitions, interest rates, fluctuations in prices for securities of comparable companies and government regulations
and changes thereof applicable to the industry and general economic conditions nationally or internationally could cause the


-----

price of each series of Notes to change. Any such developments may result in large and sudden changes in the trading volume
and price of the relevant series of Notes. There can be no assurance that these developments will not occur in the future.

**_Lenders and holders of our debt may allege in the future that we are not operating in compliance with covenants in our_**
**_debt instruments, which, even if the claims have no merit, could cause the trading price of the Notes to decline._**

Lenders or holders of our debt may assert that we are not operating in compliance with covenants in our debt
instruments or make other related allegations, including for the purpose of accelerating the maturity of such debt and/or
attempting to obtain economic benefits from us. Even if any claim by lenders or holders of our debt alleging non-compliance
or an event of default under our debt instruments is without merit, such a claim could nevertheless cause the trading price of
the Notes to decline.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the liquidity and the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and are not required to be, registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold except to QIBs in accordance with Rule
144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit
the ability of holders of the Notes to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of each holder of the Notes to ensure that its offers
and sales of the Notes within the U.S. and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors”,
“Important Information—Notice to Investors in the United States”, “Important Information—Notice to Investors in the United
_Kingdom”, “Important Information—Notice to Investors in the European Economic Area”, “Important Information—Notice_
_to French Investors”, “Important Information—Notice to German Investors”, “Important Information—Notice to Dutch_
_Investors”, “Important Information—Notice to Swiss Investors”, “Important Information—Notice to_ _Investors in_
_Luxembourg”, and “Plan of Distribution” for further information on these restrictions. We have not agreed to or otherwise_
undertaken to register any of the Notes or the Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so.

**_The market value of the Notes could decrease if the Issuer’s or our creditworthiness worsens._**

In the event any of the risks regarding our business materialises, the likelihood that the Issuer will be in a position to
fully perform all obligations under the Notes when they fall due will decrease and the market value of the Notes is likely to
suffer. In addition, even if the likelihood that the Issuer will be in a position to fully perform all obligations under the Notes
when they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless have a different perception.
Furthermore, the market participants’ estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating
in the same business as us could adversely change. If any of these risks occurred, third-parties would likely only be willing to
purchase Notes at a lower price than before any such risk materialised. Under these circumstances, the market value of the
Notes is likely to decrease.

**_Credit ratings assigned to the Notes may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension, withdrawal and may be lowered at any time._**

Credit ratings address the Issuer’s ability to perform its obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the
value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision,
suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will be confirmed,
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in our judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. The Issuer has no obligation to inform holders of
the Notes of any such revision, downgrade or withdrawal. Other credit ratings agencies that do not publish ratings with
respect to the Notes may assign a lower rating than any published rating of the Notes. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal
at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the
cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value, market price and trading of the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer and the majority of the Guarantors, including DGHL, are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales
and do not have any assets in the U.S. It is anticipated that a majority of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and
DGHL will be non-residents of the U.S. and that a majority of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a
result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the U.S. upon the Issuer and the majority of the
Guarantors, or their respective directors and executive officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts
predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition, the Issuer cannot assure you that civil
liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the U.S. will be enforceable in England and Wales. See “Service of
_Process and_ _Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”._


-----

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in pounds sterling. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than pounds sterling, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risk due to,
among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the pound sterling, as applicable, relative to the currency by
reference to which the investor measures the return on his investments because of economic, political and other factors over
which the Issuer has no control. Depreciation of the pound sterling against the currency by reference to which an investor
measures the return on his investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the relevant Notes below their stated
coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the relevant Notes is translated into the currency by
reference to which the investor measures the return on his investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. investors may also
have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Tax Considerations—Certain
_United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”._

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing_**
**_systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests
in the Global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and the Notes in definitive registered form (the “Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Unless and until**
Definitive Registered Notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be
considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, will be the registered holder of the
Global Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the
Notes will be made to BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as paying agent, which will make payments to
Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry
interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment
to Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar will have no responsibility or
liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own
a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if you are not a participant in
Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights
and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the
Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a bookentry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or
Clearstream, or, if applicable, from a participant. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be
sufficient to enable you to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to
acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be
adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”.

**_Investors in and purchasers of the Notes may have limited or no recourse against our independent auditors in respect of_**
**_the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements and against the Opus Group’s independent auditors in respect of the Opus_**
**_Group’s Audited Financial Statements._**

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports of Deloitte LLP and KPMG LLP of
each of the Group and the Opus Group, respectively.

Investors in and purchasers of the Notes should understand that consistent with guidance issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (the “ICAEW”), the independent auditors’ reports of Deloitte LLP and KPMG
LLP included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum each state that:

    - in the case of Deloitte LLP, the report has been prepared for Drax Group plc’s members, as a body, in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act. Deloitte LLP’s audit work has been undertaken so that Deloitte
LLP might state to Drax Group plc’s members those matters Deloitte LLP is required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Deloitte LLP does not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than Drax Group plc and Drax Group plc’s members, as a body, for its audit work, for
its report, or for the opinions it has formed; and

    - in the case of KPMG LLP, the report has been prepared for Opus Energy Group Limited and other named parties
(together, the “Addressees”) solely in response to a request from the Addressees for an audit opinion from KPMG
LLP on the non-statutory financial statements of Opus Energy Group Limited; that the report was designed to meet
the agreed requirements of the Addressees determined by their needs at the time; that the report should not therefore


-----

be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against KPMG LLP other than
the Addressees for any purpose or in any context; that any party other than the Addressees who obtains access to the
report or a copy and chooses to rely on the report (or any part of it) will do so at its own risk; and that to the fullest
extent permitted by law KPMG LLP will accept no responsibility or liability in respect of the report to any other
party.

Without in any way or on any basis affecting or adding to or extending KPMG LLP’s duties and responsibilities to
the Addressees or giving rise to any duty or responsibility being accepted or assumed by or imposed on the
independent auditors to any party except the Addressees, KPMG LLP has provided its consent to the inclusion of
the audit reports with respect to Opus Energy Group Limited’s non-statutory historical financial statements to which
they relate in this Offering Memorandum for a proposed issuance of Notes, thereby demonstrating that an audit of
the non-statutory financial statements of Opus Energy Group Limited for each relevant period have been undertaken
for the Addressees. The consent provided by KPMG LLP is different from a consent filed with the SEC under
Section 7 of the U.S. Securities Act, which is applicable only to transactions involving securities registered under
the U.S. Securities Act. As the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, KPMG
LLP has not filed a consent under Section 7 of the U.S Securities Act. KPMG LLP’s non-statutory historical reports
for the years ended 31 March 2016, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014 are included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in
connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange
Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language set out above, the recourse that investors in and
purchasers of the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the financial statements or nonstatutory financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which independent auditors may have
responsibility or liability to third-parties can be unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the UK. The inclusion
of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against the
independent auditors for damages arising out of an investment in or purchase of the Notes.

In the context of the Offering, the independent auditors have reconfirmed to us that they do not intend their duty of care
in respect of their audits to extend to any party, such as investors in and purchasers of the Notes, other than the respective
addressees of their reports. See “Independent Auditors”.

**_Certain covenants may fall away upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive two of the
following three ratings, BBB- or better by S&P, Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB- or better by Fitch and no default or
event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which such
Notes cease to have such ratings, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such Notes. See “Description of Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”._

If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness or make payments,
including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance
that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable as U.S. or other insolvency_**
**_laws._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in DGHL and certain of
DGHL’s subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and pledges of certain present and future
intercompany receivables held by Drax Group plc, DGHL, the Issuer and certain of DGHL’s other subsidiaries incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in England and Wales or
another relevant jurisdiction. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex and more costly for creditors and
otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. The rights of a holder of the
Notes under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of
several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce these rights in such complex,
multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of Drax Group plc’s, the Issuer’s and the nonU.S. Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organisation or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each
other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors,
ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among


-----

them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect the ability of holders of
the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that they may
receive. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_Security” with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the Offering are expected to be £550.0 million. We intend to use the gross proceeds of the
Offering, together with drawings under the New Senior Facilities: (i) to repay in full indebtedness under the Bridge Facility;
(ii) to repay in full the Existing Term Debt; (iii) to pay estimated fees and expenses of the Refinancing including prepayment
fees, underwriting fees and commissions, professional fees and other transaction costs associated with the Refinancing; and
(iv) for general corporate purposes.

The following table sets out the expected sources and uses of funds from the Offering. Actual amounts are subject to
adjustments and may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including, but not limited to, differences in
the outstanding balances and accrued but unpaid interest of the Existing Term Debt on the Issue Date and the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing. Any changes in these amounts may be reflected as an increase or
decrease, as applicable, in the use of cash from the balance sheet or drawings under the New Revolving Facility to fund the
Refinancing. For a description of our anticipated indebtedness following the Refinancing, see “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements” and “Capitalisation”._

or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non_IFRS Financial Measures”._ A reconciliation from profit for the year to EBITDA is presented below:

longer required on the generation units converted to biomass (£92.6 million), (ii) a decision to abandon the development of a technology solution to
comply with the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”) (£10.0 million) and (iii) a decision not to proceed with a third wood pellet plant project in

(2) We define underlying profit after tax as profit for the year excluding unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, asset obsolescence charges, the impact
of the CESP settlement, the tax impact of the above items and the impact of deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences in our U.S.
business. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for more information.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

On 10 February 2017, Drax Research, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Drax Group plc acquired the entire
issued share capital of Opus for cash consideration of £340 million (the “Opus Acquisition”), plus interest calculated on the
net assets of Opus from 31 March 2016 to 10 February 2017, the Opus Acquisition completion date. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial information has been prepared to give effect to the Opus Acquisition, the related financing under the
Bridge Facility, the Offering and the Refinancing (collectively, the “Transactions”).

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting
policies and presentation adopted by Drax Group plc in relation to its consolidated financial statements for the year. The
unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is comprised of the unaudited pro forma consolidated income
statement of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2016, as if the Transactions had taken place on 1 January 2016,
and the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2016, as if the Transactions had taken place at that
date.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 has been prepared based
on (i) the historical audited financial statements for Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 and (ii) the Opus
LTM Financial Information. The Opus LTM Financial Information was derived by adding the non-statutory consolidated
income statement data of the Opus Group for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2016 to the unaudited non-statutory
consolidated income statement data for the nine months ended 31 December 2016 and deducting the unaudited non-statutory
income statement data for the nine months ended 31 December 2015.

The historical financial statements for Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 were prepared in
accordance with IFRS. The historical financial information for Opus for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2016, the nine
months ended 31 December 2015 and the nine months ended 31 December 2016 was prepared in accordance with IFRS on a
basis consistent with the accounting policies and presentation adopted by Drax Group plc.

The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in
accordance with IFRS, under which the assets and liabilities of Opus are recorded by Drax Group plc at their respective fair
values as at the date the Opus Acquisition is completed. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been prepared
to illustrate the estimated effect of the Transactions. Pro forma adjustments reflected in the pro forma financial information
are based on items that are factually supportable and directly attributable to the Transactions.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is provided for informational purposes only and
does not purport to represent what the actual results of operations of Drax Group plc would have been had the Transactions
occurred on the respective dates assumed, nor is it indicative of the future results of the consolidated company. The pro forma
adjustments reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma financial information reflect estimates and assumptions made
by our management that we believe to be reasonable.

The unaudited pro forma condensed financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards.
Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting unaudited pro forma financial data have been
audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

**Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information**

**1.** **Basis of presentation**

This unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is based on the Drax Group plc and the Opus Group
historical financial information as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma consolidated income
statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on 1 January 2016.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 gives effect to the Transactions as if they had
occurred on that date.

**_Opus Group historical financial information_**

The Opus Group income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 has been derived by adding the income
statement data of the Opus Group for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2016 to the income statement data for the nine months
ended 31 December 2016 and deducting the income statement data for the nine months ended 31 December 2015.

The following table summarises these calculations and adjustments to arrive at the Opus Group income statement for
the year ended 31 December 2016 aligned with the Drax Group plc income statement presentation:

The balance sheet of the Opus Group as at 31 December 2016 has been extracted from the historical financial
information of Opus without adjustment except that £11.0 million of trade and other payables have been reclassified as
borrowing to reflect amount drawn under Opus’ revolving credit facility as of 31 December 2016.

**2.** **Preliminary purchase price allocation**

As described above, on 10 February 2017, Drax Research acquired the entire issued share capital of Opus for cash
consideration of £340 million, plus interest calculated on the amount of the Opus Group’s net assets from 31 March 2016 to
10 February 2017, the acquisition completion date.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information has been prepared on the basis that the Opus Acquisition
will be treated as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3, under which the assets and liabilities of the Opus Group
will be recorded by Drax Group plc at their respective fair values as at the date the Opus Acquisition was completed.
However, for the purposes of the unaudited pro forma financial information, the purchase price allocation is preliminary and
does not reflect any fair value adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities as the fair value measurement of these items


-----

has not yet been finalised. The excess purchase consideration over the carrying amount of the net assets of the Opus Group
has been attributed to goodwill and other intangibles. The fair value adjustments, when finalised, may be material. The
preliminary goodwill arising has been calculated as follows and included in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet:

**£million**
Total consideration paid[(a)] ......................................................................................................................... 367.3
Net assets of the Opus Group ................................................................................................................... 26.9
Purchase consideration in excess of net assets
(shown as goodwill and other intangibles) ........................................................................................... 340.4

(a) The consideration paid of £367.3 million has been determined based on the cash consideration paid of £340 million plus £27.3 million additional consideration
representing the interest calculated on the amount of the Opus Group’s net assets from 31 March 2016 to the acquisition completion date.

**3.** **Other Pro forma adjustments**

The other pro forma adjustments are based on our preliminary estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.
The following adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information:

**_Adjustments to the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement_**

_(a)_ _Opus Acquisition related costs_

We and Opus incurred a total of £1.6 million and £0.4 million in transaction costs during the period ended
31 December 2016, respectively, in relation to the Opus Acquisition. An adjustment of £2.0 million has been reflected
in the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement to reverse these charges as these are nonrecurring charges
that are direct and incremental to the Opus Acquisition.

_(b)_ _Interest expense_

For the purposes of reflecting the Opus Acquisition and the related financing under the Bridge Facility, a pro forma
interest expense adjustment of £13.6 million including amortisation of borrowing costs, has been included for the
Bridge Facility used to finance the Opus Acquisition as though the Bridge Facility was obtained on 1 January 2016 and
was outstanding for the entire year ended 31 December 2016.

For the purposes of reflecting the Refinancing, a further adjustment has been made. The following table summarises
the components of the adjustment:

**£million**
Remove impact of Bridge Facility interest and amortisation of borrowing costs ................... (13.6)
Remove impact of Existing Term Debt interest ...................................................................... (13.6)
Add interest in relation to the Offering and the New Senior Facilities ................................... 25.9
Add amortisation of deferred financing costs associated with the Offering ........................... 2.8
**Total impact on pro forma interest from Refinancing ......................................................** **1.5**

The interest payable on the Offering was calculated using interest rates of 4.25% and 4.34% for the Senior Secured
Fixed Rate Notes and Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, respectively. A 1/8 per cent increase or decrease in interest
rates would result in a change in interest expense of £0.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2016.

_(c)_ _Income tax_

These adjustments reflect the income tax impact of the pro forma adjustments above related to Transaction related
costs. The tax credit of £2.3 million and £0.3 million reflects the estimated tax deduction arising from the pro forma
adjustment of £11.6 million and £1.5 million using the standard rate of tax that applied in the year ended 31 December
2016 of 20.0%.

**_Adjustments to the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet_**

_(d)_ _Borrowings_

On 10 February 2017, the Opus Acquisition was financed through borrowings under the Bridge Facility, under which
certain lenders made available a £375.0 million committed acquisition facility, including, without limitation, a term
facility for the purposes of the Opus Acquisition. The adjustment to borrowings for the purposes of the acquisition
reflects £200.0 million drawn under the Bridge Facility net of transaction costs.

An additional adjustment has been made to reflect the Offering used to refinance the Bridge Facility and the Existing
Term Debt. For purposes of the adjustment to the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet we have assumed the
Offering of £550.0 million and the New Senior Facilities drawn of £35.0 million would be used to pay down (i) the


-----

amount outstanding under the Bridge Facility (£200.0 million), and (ii) the Existing Term Debt (£327.9 million,
£35.9 million of which is classified as short-term debt in the Drax Group plc balance sheet).

Deferred financing costs of £14.0 million associated with the Offering are shown as a reduction of non-current
borrowings in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet.

_(e)_ _Opus Acquisition related costs_

We and Opus incurred a total of £4.8 million and £2.4 million subsequent to the period ended 31 December 2016,
respectively, in relation to the Opus Acquisition. As these costs were incurred after 31 December 2016, no adjustment
is reflected in the unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement, but the unaudited pro forma consolidated
balance sheet reflects the adjustment of £7.2 million as the costs are nonrecurring and direct and incremental to the
Opus Acquisition.

For purposes of adjusting retained profits for the Opus Acquisition, we have adjusted for the £7.2 million described
above in addition to eliminating the £20.8 million of retained profits of Opus.

_(f)_ _Deferred borrowing costs associated with Bridge Facility_

Deferred borrowing costs of £0.2 million and £4.0 million were incurred as at 31 December 2016 and subsequent to
31 December 2016, respectively, in relation to the Bridge Facility. These amounts have been eliminated from the
unaudited pro forma balance sheet on the basis that the Bridge Facility will be refinanced with proceeds from the
Offering.

_(g)_ _Deferred financing costs associated with existing term debt_

As at 31 December 2016, there were unamortised deferred borrowing costs of £7.1 million associated with existing
term debt, which have been offset against the carrying amount of the related borrowing. A pro forma adjustment has
been recognised against retained earnings to reflect the recognition of such deferred financing costs in profit and loss
upon the refinancing of the existing term debt. The total adjustment to retained profits of £26.3 million also includes
the impact of the deferred borrowing costs relating to the Bridge Facility and other costs relating to the Refinancing.

_(h)_ _Cash and cash equivalents_

The reduction in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the Opus Acquisition of £167.3 million represents the
purchase price of £367.3 million offset by £200 million drawn from the Bridge Facility.

The following table summarises the components of the adjustment to cash arising from the refinancing:

**£million**
Proceeds from Offering .......................................................................................................... 550.0
Drawings under the New Senior Facilities ............................................................................. 35.0
Less Bridge Facility repaid ..................................................................................................... (200.0)
Less Existing Term Debt repaid ............................................................................................. (327.9)
Less transaction costs ............................................................................................................. (29.0)
**Total impact on pro forma cash from Refinancing............................................................** **28.1**

_(i)_ _Shareholders’ equity adjustments_

Represents the adjustment to eliminate Opus’ historical shareholders’ equity.

**4.** **Pro forma underlying profit after tax**

Underlying profit after tax is defined as profit for the year excluding unrealised gains and losses on derivative
contracts, asset obsolescence charges, the impact of the CESP settlement, the tax impact of the above items and the impact of
deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences in our U.S. business. See “Presentation of Financial

**Overview**

We are an innovative vertically-integrated electricity generation and supply business with operations in the UK and the
U.S. We own and operate the largest power plant in the UK by generation capacity with an installed capacity of
approximately 4GW, mainly via our six 645MW generation units. Our business is comprised of three segments with an
integrated strategy where we source and produce fuel, generate electricity and supply electricity, gas and wood pellets to end
customers.

We are an important part of the UK’s energy infrastructure, supplying approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s electricity
in 2016. We generated approximately 16 per cent. of the UK’s renewable energy in 2015. Based on the 2015-2016
compliance period, we are also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable energy. We provide flexible and reliable
generation and produced 65 per cent. of our electricity for the year ended 31 December 2016 from sustainable biomass,
making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy. Our three 645MW biomass-fired generation units receive
regulatory support, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable revenue. Our
biomass-fired generation assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass supply chain comprising dedicated port
handling infrastructure and rail paths, thereby enhancing security of supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities.
Our three 645MW capacity coal-fired generation units provide important support services to the UK’s electricity system
including greater reliability and flexibility at times of low De-rated Reserve Margins and system stress. In response to the
growth in inflexible, intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid, we recently acquired four rapid-response OCGT
development projects with the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and diversify
our future energy generation capability.

Taken together, Haven Power and the Opus Group were, as of 31 October 2016, the fifth largest supplier of electricity
to businesses in the UK by volume. Haven Power and the Opus Group provide us with a direct route into the retail market for
much of the electricity we generate. We believe counterparties to retail sales place fewer credit restrictions on us than
wholesale market counterparties and selling to the retail market provides us with a more diversified counterparty base with
less overall counterparty credit risk.

We produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources in two plants in the southern U.S. and use those pellets
as fuel for our biomass-fired generation. We have recently announced our successful bid to acquire a third wood pellet


-----

manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which we expect to complete by the end of April 2017. We expect the acquisition to
significantly increase our production capacity during 2018. We have also entered into long-term contracts with wood pellet
suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass.

Drax Group plc is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange under stock ticker “DRX”, and is part of
the FTSE 250 Index. Drax Group plc’s market capitalisation as at 13 April 2017 was approximately £1,290 million. Our pro
_forma consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2016 was £507.6 million._

The three segments of our business are:

    - Generation: Through our Generation segment, we play a significant role in providing reliable renewable baseload
electricity generation capacity, enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s
transition to a low-carbon future. In 2016, we generated approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s electricity needs (of
which approximately 65 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass) from the Power Station, located near
Selby, Yorkshire. In 2015 our sustainable biomass-fired generation units produced approximately 16 per cent. of the
UK’s renewable electricity at approximately 10 per cent. of the cost to consumers.

Our three biomass-fired generation units qualify for attractive regulatory support via the RO Scheme and CfD
Regime which provide the Power Station with financial support to facilitate the production of baseload electricity.
The six generation units at the Power Station are the largest in their class in the UK, with an output capacity of up to
645MW each, compared with the typical coal-fired thermal generation unit size for larger power stations in the UK
of approximately 500MW. Each of the generation units is operated independently and has the flexibility to generate
electricity between 200MW and 645MW. We have identified a growing need for system support services and have
signed and renewed a number of contracts with the System Operator to supply Ancillary Services systems support.
Furthermore, we recently acquired four rapid-response OCGT generation projects across England and Wales which,
if and when developed, we expect will benefit from the stable earnings afforded by capacity market agreements.

    - Retail: We supply electricity and gas to businesses through Haven Power (Supplier of the Year at the 2016 Energy
Awards) and the Opus Group, which we acquired in February 2017. Both Haven Power and the Opus Group provide
us with a credit-efficient route to market for a proportion of the electricity we generate and the ROCs that our
Generation segment earns. The majority of Haven Power’s sales volumes are with larger I&C customers such as
Manchester Airport Group and Thames Water, while the Opus Group is focused on small and medium sized
enterprises (“SME”). Taken together, Haven Power and the Opus Group were, as of 31 October 2016, the fifth
largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume. We expect the Opus Group, a leading challenger
brand to the Big Six in the SME market, to enhance and broaden our retail offering in the SME market with a wider
product range than we previously offered, including, for example, gas. We also own Billington Bioenergy, a
biomass pellet supplier to businesses and households.

    - Biomass Supply: Through our Biomass Supply segment based in the southern U.S., we manufacture and supply
compressed wood pellets from sustainably managed forests. We take low-grade wood and residues from other wood
processing industries and transform them into pellets that can be transported around the world to supply low-carbon
energy. We operate two wood pellet manufacturing facilities in Bastrop, Louisiana and Gloster, Mississippi, both of
which are certified under the Sustainable Biomass Program, an industry standard, demonstrating that biomass is
legally and sustainably sourced. Our manufacturing facilities have a combined annual capacity of 900,000 tonnes,
which we expect to increase through planned expansion to 1,050,000 tonnes by the end of 2017. In addition,
following the acquisition of a third wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana (which we
expect will complete by the end of April 2017), we expect to increase our combined annual capacity by a further
450,000 tonnes during 2018. In 2016, our total biomass production was approximately 607,000 tonnes. We operate
a port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which includes two 40,000 tonne storage domes to transport pellets from
our own manufacturing facilities and from approved third-party suppliers to the UK for use by our Generation
segment. The port facility can load more than 15,000 tonnes of pellets per day and can accommodate Panamax
Vessels.

**Recent Developments**

In April 2017, we announced our successful bid to acquire the assets of Louisiana Pellets. Louisiana Pellets is the
owner and developer of a wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana. The auction price was
US$35.4 million. A court hearing approving the auction result was held on 4 April 2017 and completion of the sale is
expected to by the end of April 2017.

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Our operating results are affected by a combination of economic, regulatory and industry- and company-specific
factors. Economic conditions influence electricity demand, the pricing of fuel, electricity and other commodities and


-----

emissions allowances, which affect both our revenues and the costs associated with our operations. The regulatory framework
determines the parameters in which the industry, generally, and we, specifically, operate. Industry-specific factors include
technology, competition, capacity and supply/demand balance. Factors that specifically impact our operating results include,
but are not limited to, plant reliability and efficiency, capital expenditure requirements, the ability to benefit from subsidies
for the generation of electricity from renewable sources and the extent to which we have hedged our exposure to commodity
and foreign exchange currency risks. The most important of such factors are discussed below.

**_Bark Spread and Dark Green Spread_**

The two core elements to our Generation gross profit are the “bark spread” for electricity generated from biomass and
the “dark green spread” for electricity generated from coal.

The “bark spread” is the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the cost of sustainable biomass, net of
renewable support. The cost of sustainable biomass burned is the gross cost of purchasing the fuel, which includes the cost of
the raw material, processing costs, logistics, handling and storage costs, and is influenced by exchange rates where the fuel is
contracted in a foreign currency. The renewable support reflects the value of the ROCs earned through generating electricity
from burning sustainable biomass or payments to the renewable generator under the CfD Regime. As a renewable fuel,
biomass is exempt from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support.

The “dark green spread” is the difference between the wholesale electricity price and the cost of coal and carbon,
including emissions allowances under the EU ETS and the Carbon Price Support. The cost of coal and emissions allowances
is driven by market prices at the time the purchases are secured.

_Electricity prices_

The wholesale electricity price is affected by a variety of factors, including the price of underlying commodities such
as oil, natural gas and emissions allowances, availability of generating capacity on the wholesale electricity market (and, in
particular, the level of intermittent generation from sources such as wind and solar compared to baseload generation from
coal and nuclear power stations), the level of demand and wider macroeconomic conditions. These factors together determine
the “marginal plant”, which drives the wholesale electricity price. A power station’s cost of generation is determined largely
by the cost of the type of fuel used, which cost can be susceptible to market forces and vary significantly. Some power
stations have negative marginal costs of generation, such as those which use wind or solar, as the renewable support provided
to these renewable generators exceed the cost of generation.

Power stations can be modelled, according to their different costs of generation, as a stack, which is overlaid with
forecasted demand for electricity. The available power stations are drawn on to supply electricity to fulfil this demand,
starting with the power stations that have the lowest costs of generation. At the point in the demand stack where forecast
demand intersects with available supply, the power station supplying electricity at the point of intersection is known as the
“marginal plant”. The price at which the marginal power plant is willing to generate therefore dictates the overall market
price.

Since 2014, wholesale electricity prices in the UK have moved marginally lower, principally reflecting lower gas prices
(as the “marginal plant” is currently typically a gas-fired power station), wind and solar generation displacing coal generation
(the former having no cost of fuel), increases in the amount of electricity imported into the UK via interconnectors and
electricity demand generally trending lower. As a result, our average electricity price per MWh of electricity sold decreased
by approximately 5.8 per cent. from £51.3 in 2014 to £48.3 in 2016. As of February 2017, we had forward sold
approximately 17.8 TWh and 7.0 TWh of electricity for delivery in 2017 and 2018 at average achieved prices of £45.0 per
MWh and £42.6 per MWh, respectively. The volume of electricity sold under these contracts amounted to approximately
91 per cent. and 36 per cent. respectively of our electricity output for the year ended 31 December 2016. During periods of
low electricity prices, the electricity price that we can achieve in the market may not cover our costs of fuel and, in the case
of generation from coal, emissions allowances. As a result, it may be more economical for us to idle, or reduce the load factor
on, all or some of the generation units in the Power Station. The increase in generation from intermittent renewables such as
wind or solar power combined with a decrease in available conventional generation capacity due to the retirement of older,
less efficient and mostly coal-fired power stations also resulted in more volatile wholesale electricity prices, in particular
during the last three months of 2016. This volatility presents an opportunity for generators like us which can produce
significant amounts of electricity at relatively short notice at times of peak demand, for example at times of lower production
from intermittent renewables due to adverse weather conditions. We expect that the increasing trend to intermittent
renewables generation coupled with a decrease in conventional generation, in particular from coal-fired power stations, to
continue in the short- to medium-term and to continue to contribute to lower load factors in the coal-fired generation units
and more volatile wholesale electricity prices in the UK generally.


-----

_Fuel and carbon prices_

Despite lower coal and biomass prices since 2014, our average cost of fuel increased in the same period. The average
cost of fuel, before the impact of costs of emissions allowances, the Carbon Price Support and ROC support, was £51.8 per
MWh in 2016 compared with £40.3 per MWh in 2014, reflecting the shift from coal to predominantly biomass fuelled
generation as the biomass required to generate a MWh of electricity is more expensive than the coal required to generate the
same amount of electricity.

The cost of carbon in the dark green spread is made up of two elements, the cost of emissions allowances under the EU
ETS and Carbon Price Support. The average cost of emissions allowances in support of coal-fired generation was £5.48 per
MWh in 2016 compared to £4.08 per MWh in 2014. The Carbon Price Support rate for the first year of operation
(2013/2014) was £4.94/tonne, increasing to £9.55/tonne in 2014/2015 and £18.08/tonne in 2015/16; however, the Carbon
Price Support price has been capped at £18/tonne from 2016 until 2021. The Government is expected to review the position
for the period after 2021 and provide further details in the second half of 2017.

**_Availability_**

We receive a significant proportion of our revenues from wholesale electricity sales from the Power Station. Our
revenues are therefore affected by the availability of the Power Station to generate electricity. Availability is in turn impacted
by planned and unplanned outages due to maintenance, inspections or other safety-related incidents. Each of our six
generation units at the Power Station typically has a planned outage every four years and these outages are usually scheduled
for the summer months, when electricity demand and power prices are lower.

During 2016, the Power Station had an availability of approximately 77.1 per cent. compared to 85.1 per cent. in 2015
and 85.0 per cent. in 2014. The availability for 2016 reflected a particularly busy maintenance schedule that included planned
outages on two of the six generation units (with a duration of 79 and 139 days, respectively (the latter of which took longer
than anticipated due to an unplanned equipment failure)), as well as four shorter outages for essential repair works. The
availability for 2015 is principally a result of a single planned outage. For 2014, the availability of 85.0 per cent. mainly
reflects a single planned outage year.

We anticipate a planned outage in 2017 for our biomass-fired generation unit that receives support under the CfD
Regime. This outage is scheduled to last for approximately 10-12 weeks during the late summer. If the outage is completed as
planned, we expect it to have a negative impact on our profitability of approximately £30 million.

**_Regulation_**

_Renewables_

Revenue from our biomass-fired generation units is supported by the RO Scheme, in the case of the first two generation
units, and the CfD Regime, in the case of the third generation unit. The RO Scheme is a market-based mechanism that was
introduced in 2002 to support the deployment of large scale renewable energy in the UK. The RO Scheme requires licensed
electricity suppliers to submit a specified number of ROCs to Ofgem per MWh of electricity they supply or to make a buyout payment. ROCs are issued by Ofgem to accredited renewables generators for each MWh of renewable electricity
generated. The number of ROCs received by a generator per MWh of electricity produced differs depending on the type of
renewable generation technology utilised. We receive one ROC per MWh of electricity generated from the first and second
generation units. Under the current RO Scheme, the first and second generation units converted to biomass are eligible to
receive ROCs until March 2027.

ROCs are tradable certificates that have no fixed price so the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC is
negotiated between the generator and supplier. However, the buy-out payment that a supplier would have to make if it failed
to present a sufficient number of ROCs to Ofgem effectively sets a price cap on ROCs and historically the purchase price has
been lower than the buy-out payment. Each ROC is also entitled to a share of the buy-out fund, in which all buy-out
payments from suppliers are pooled and then recycled back to suppliers in proportion to the number of ROCs they have
validly submitted toward discharging their obligation in the relevant period. Many of our contracts for the sale of ROCs to
suppliers contain a provision that requires the supplier to pass the recycle payment received by the supplier following
submission of the ROC to Ofgem on to us. Prior to August 2015, we received LECs for the supply of electricity generated
from the generation units that had been converted to biomass. We could sell the LECs to suppliers who could use the LECs to
demonstrate that the energy they supplied was CCL-exempt. Effective 1 August 2015, the CCL-exemption for the supply of
electricity from renewable sources was withdrawn and we are no longer eligible for LECs, which we estimate resulted in a
negative impact on our EBITDA of approximately £30 million in 2015 and £60 million in 2016. See “Risk Factors—Risk
_Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry—The reduction or abandonment of governmental support for generation of_
_electricity from biomass or other relevant changes in governmental energy policy may materially adversely affect our_
_business, operations, financial condition and results of operations”._


-----

Revenues from the external sale of ROCs and LECs amounted to £200.1 million, £290.8 million and £366.7 million in
2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Effective 19 December 2016 and following the state aid approval by the European Commission, electricity generated in
our third biomass-fired generation unit is supported by the CfD Regime. Our CfD has a term until 2027 and provides for a
strike price of £105.86 per MWh as of 31 December 2016. The strike price is adjusted annually to reflect consumer price
inflation and system balancing costs in the UK. Based on average realised electricity prices since 2014, we expect our CfD to
contribute significantly to our revenue and gross profit going forward, providing increased visibility and stability of earnings.

_Conventional generation_

In November 2016, the Government initiated a public consultation seeking stakeholder feedback on its proposal to put
into effect an end to unabated electricity generation from coal by 2025. Against the background of these plans, we expect that
electricity generation from coal at the Power Station will end by 2025. Accordingly, we decided to adopt a more focused and
tailored maintenance plan for our coal-fired generation units, which is expected to lead to lower maintenance capital
expenditure on these units compared to our historical maintenance capital expenditure. A major outage of one of the coalfired generation units that was initially planned for 2017 has also been deferred to 2018. Furthermore, we decided to
accelerate the depreciation of the coal-specific assets at the Power Station from 2017 onwards. Coal-specific assets include
those assets that are only useful for as long as the unconverted generation units are coal-fired (such as the coal transportation
system), but not the generation units itself as these can potentially be converted to biomass and be operational after 2025.

Effective January 2016, the IED sets an annual limit on the amount of NOx that we can emit from the Power Station.
This limit is provided in the form of allowances. We must either ensure that the generation profile of the Power Station’s coal
and biomass units operates within this limit or else purchase surplus allowances from other generators equal to the excess.

The type and quality of fuel used in generation (particularly the quality of coal) and the load factor of the generation
units have an impact on the amount of NOx and other gases released by the Power Station. We also have selective noncatalytic reduction technology fitted to five of the Power Station’s six generation units which can be turned on (at a cost) to
reduce NOx emissions. However, ultimately if the Power Station is about to exceed its annual limit and is unable to acquire
additional emissions allowances from the market, we would have to reduce the level of otherwise profitable generation.

**_Capital and Operating Expenditure_**

Since 2012, we have made significant investments and incurred the corresponding capital expenditure. Our nonrecurring capital expenditures mainly related to the conversion of three of the generation units at the Power Station to
biomass and the investment in two U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities and the associated transport infrastructure, such
as loading and unloading terminals in the U.S. and the UK. Since 2012 we spent more than £650 million on this biomass
conversion project (including the investment to make these generation units IED-compliant) which is now substantially
complete.

Our recurring capital expenditure is concentrated in the Generation segment. In contrast, the operations of the Biomass
Supply segment and the Retail segment require relatively small amounts of maintenance capital expenditure. Within the
Generation segment, recurring capital expenditures mainly relate to scheduled maintenance work, technological
improvements (such as investments to comply with the IED) and unscheduled repairs. Following the Government’s
consultation on an end to unabated electricity generation from coal by 2025, we put in place a leaner maintenance schedule
for the three coal-fired generation units and deferred certain maintenance work. We therefore expect that the maintenance
capital expenditure on these generation units going forward will be significantly lower than in previous years. See also “—
_Depreciation of Coal Specific Assets” below._

Our capital expenditure amounted to £200.6 million, £173.8 million and £95.7 million in 2014, 2015 and 2016,
respectively. For the year ending 31 December 2017, we expect capital expenditure to be broadly in line with 2016 (except
for the additional capital expenditure related to the acquisition of the assets of Louisiana Pellets (initial auction price of US$
35.4 million and additional capital expenditure for ramp up of production), investments in additional capacity at our existing
U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities (approximately US$15 million), initial investments in connection with our four
OCGT projects and the purchase of a new office building by Opus (approximately £9 million)). Other capital expenditure is
expected to comprise mainly relate to strategic spares (i.e. large equipment for the Power Station with long lead times that we
keep on-site to reduce the risk of prolonged unplanned outages) and in our IT systems in the Retail segment. In the medium
term, we expect that our capital expenditure will be principally dependent on the decision as to whether and when to pursue
the development of the four OCGT projects acquired in December 2016. If developed, these OCGT power plants are
expected to become operational between 2020 and 2024 and to require an investment of approximately £80 million to
£100 million each.

Our results of operations are also affected by our operating and administrative expenses. In the years ended
31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016 operating and administrative expenses were £220.4 million, £239.8 million and


-----

£236.3 million, respectively. In 2017, we expect our operating expense to increase as a result of the cost of the planned
outage on our third biomass-fired generation unit and costs related to IT projects in our Retail segment.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

We are exposed to commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and inflation rate risks in the course
of our business and financing activities. We seek to hedge our exposure to these risks by entering into derivative financial
instruments where deemed appropriate. For example, as of 31 December 2016 and 2015, we had outstanding derivative
financial instruments in respect of commodities and foreign currency exchange rates with an aggregate notional value (based
on the undiscounted net cash inflows/outflows) of £3,510.3 million and £3,959.4 million, respectively.

During 2016, the pound sterling depreciated significantly against other major currencies such as the U.S. dollar, the
euro and the Canadian dollar. As we had hedged significant parts of our exposure from fuel and emissions allowances
purchases to these currencies, we recognised significant balance sheet gains from higher mark-to-market values of these
hedging arrangements. We are extensively hedged against foreign currency volatility until the end of 2021, but thereafter a
sustained weakness in the pound sterling may lead to higher fuel prices for us.

**_Seasonality_**

Our business is seasonal, with higher electricity prices in the energy market and dispatch in October to March and
lower electricity prices and dispatch from April to September, during which time the availability of the Power Station is also
lower as a result of more planned outages. Accordingly, cash flow during April to September is materially reduced due to the
combined effect of lower prices and lower output, while maintenance expenditures are increased during this period due to
major planned outages. Fluctuations in our cash flow cycle are principally managed through cash at hand. In the Biomass
Supply segment, unseasonably wet weather can reduce the availability of raw materials to produce wood pellets as our fibre
suppliers may experience difficulties or may be unable to access harvesting sites.

**_Depreciation of Coal-Specific Assets_**

During 2016, management assessed the likely future prospects of our existing generation units and took the decision to
reduce the expected remaining useful economic life of coal-specific assets to a long stop date of 2025, in line with the
Government’s stated ambition for the cessation of unabated coal generation. This decision followed the launch of a public
consultation in November 2016 seeking stakeholder feedback on this ambition.

Coal-specific assets include those assets that are only useful for as long as the unconverted generation units are coalfired (such as the coal transportation system), but not the actual generation units as these can potentially be converted to
biomass and be operational after 2025. We expect that this decision will increase depreciation charges by approximately
£27 million per annum, beginning in 2017 until 2025.

**_Ancillary Services_**

The displacement of conventional thermal generation with intermittent renewable generation and inflexible nuclear
power has increased the demand for the provision of “balancing” services (adjusting the level of generation to allow the
operator of the UK electricity grid to balance supply and demand) and other Ancillary Services. The System Operator has
wide discretion as to which services to put to tender and at what time to ensure grid stability. As such, contracts for these
services are not awarded at regular intervals. However, the changing nature of the electricity grid means that the System
Operator is becoming increasingly innovative (particularly to ensure stability in periods of low demand) and is putting a
wider range of services to tender than in the past.

We compete with other generators for Ancillary Services contracts in these areas, the revenues from which can support
falling or negative dark green spreads in respect of our coal-fired generation. Revenues from Ancillary Services amounted to
£47.3 million in 2016 compared to £14.0 million in 2015 and £13.3 million in 2014.

**Significant Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial Information**

**_Acquisitions and Biomass Supply Investments_**

On 10 February 2017, we acquired Opus, a UK retail energy business providing electricity and gas mainly to SMEcustomers. The historical combined financial information for Opus and the Drax Group has been reflected in the Unaudited
Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We believe that Opus will
provide an additional credit-efficient route to sell electricity from our Generation segment in the market once the existing
supply contracts with Opus’ third-party suppliers have been terminated and replaced with intra-group supply arrangements.
As a retail business, Opus is less capital intensive and is less exposed to volatility in commodity prices than our Generation
segment and is therefore expected to contribute to more stable, diversified earnings. Within the Retail segment, Opus is
focused on the SME market, which is characterised by lower consumption per customer and higher gross margins compared


-----

to the more competitive I&C market, from which Haven Power derives the majority of its sales. This is evidenced by the
relatively high gross margins that Opus delivered compared to Haven Power in 2015 and 2016. However, in the nine-month
period ended 31 December 2016, Opus’ gross margins have been lower than in the fiscal years ended 31 March 2015 and
2016. The main reason for Opus’ lower gross margin was the impact of the withdrawal of the CCL-exemption for the supply
of renewable energy which became effective from 1 August 2015. Prior to that date, Opus could reduce the CCL-cost and the
costs associated with SS-FiT-schemes by importing renewable energy and purchasing LECs. The cost of purchasing LECs
was lower than the avoided costs of CCL and SS-FiTs. This effect, together with higher operating and administrative
expenses, due to higher commissions to TPIs, has recently had a negative impact on Opus’ profitability. See “Our _Business—_
_Retail—The Opus Group” for more information regarding the Opus Acquisition._

We expect the Opus Acquisition to affect our financial results in the future in a variety of important respects. Following
the acquisition, our financial results will be consolidated with Opus’ financial results and will be impacted by Opus’ revenues
and expenses. We will account for the acquisition of Opus using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
IFRS, under which the assets and liabilities of Opus will be recorded by Drax Group plc at their respective fair values as at
the date the acquisition is completed. We expect to recognise a substantial amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance
sheet as a result of the acquisition of Opus. In addition, we entered into the Bridge Facility in connection with the Opus
Acquisition, a portion of which will be refinanced from the proceeds of the Notes, and our interest expense will increase as a
result of the indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Facility and the Notes.

In 2015, we acquired Billington Bioenergy, a UK wood pellet retail business which is a part of our Retail segment.
Beginning in 2014, we also invested in the construction of two wood pellet manufacturing facilities and related port
infrastructure in the U.S. The wood pellet manufacturing facilities commenced commercial operations in 2015 and supply our
Generation segment with wood pellets under long-term fixed price contracts. As part of our strategy to supply the Power
Station with at least 30 per cent. of its annual demand for wood pellets from our own production, we will consider targeted
acquisitions if we can identify attractive opportunities, including the potential acquisition of financially distressed wood
pellet manufacturing facilities in the U.S. In April 2017, we announced that our bid to acquire a wood pellet manufacturing
facility located in Louisiana had been accepted following court approval, and the completion of the sale is expected to occur
by the end of April 2017. See “—Recent Developments”. We have also identified the opportunity to make incremental capital
investment in our existing U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities to increase capacity, allowing a greater utilisation of the
lowest cost residue material, helping to reduce the overall cost of biomass, at an estimated capital cost of US$15 million. We
intend to deliver the increased capacity to our original manufacturing facilities by the end of 2017.

**_Contract for Difference_**

Following the approval by the European Commission on 19 December 2016, our CfD for electricity produced by our
third biomass-fired generation unit became effective. Our CfD provides a variable top-up to a reference price which reflects
average wholesale electricity prices over a certain period. Our CfD is between Drax Power as a renewable electricity
generator and the Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited, a limited company owned by the UK Government (the
“LCCC”), as the CfD counterparty, under which payments are made by reference to a fixed price for each MWh of
electricity produced, known as the strike price. As of 31 December 2016, the strike price under our CfD amounted to £105.86
per MWh and is adjusted annually to reflect consumer price inflation and system balancing costs in the UK. We sell the
electricity in the wholesale market and when the reference price (which is an average price and therefore not directly related
to the price at which we sell the underlying electricity) is below the strike price, we receive a top-up payment from the LCCC
for the additional amount we generate and when the reference price is above the strike price, we must pay back the difference
it generates to the LCCC. As a result, we have stability in respect of the price of the electricity that we generate from the
biomass-fired generation unit to which our CfD relates, which extends to 2027.

**_Loss of Climate Change Levy Exemption_**

Effective 1 August 2015 generators ceased to receive LECs in respect of electricity generated from renewable sources
as the CCL-exemption for the supply of energy from renewable sources was withdrawn at that time. As a result, we no longer
earn LECs from the generation of such electricity. The withdrawal of the CCL exemption for electricity generated from
renewable sources and the related loss of LECs had material negative effects on our EBITDA. We estimate that such negative
impact amounted to approximately £30 million in 2015 and £60 million in 2016. See “Industry Overview—UK clean energy
_legislation—Climate Change Levy”._

**Key Performance Indicators**

Our management uses a number of key financial and non-financial performance indicators to track the performance of
our business. The principal key performance indicators we monitor are total revenue, gross profit, EBITDA, underlying profit
after tax and net debt. Additionally, we rely on electricity output (in TWh), availability and average achieved electricity price
per MWh sold to track the performance of our Generation segment, electricity sales (in TWh) to track the performance of our
Retail segment and wood pellets production (in tonnes) to track the performance of our Biomass Supply segment.


-----

EBITDA, underlying profit after tax and net debt are not accounting measures within the scope of IFRS. We define
EBITDA as profit before interest, tax, depreciation (including asset obsolescence charges and losses on disposal),
amortisation, unrealised gains on derivative contracts and the one-off settlement in connection with the “Community Energy
Savings Programme” (“CESP”) in 2014. Underlying profit after tax is defined as profit for the year excluding the post-tax
effect of unrealised gains on derivative contracts, asset obsolescence charges, losses on disposals, and the one-off settlement
in connection with the CESP in 2014 as well as the effect of the deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary
differences. Net debt is defined as current and non-current borrowings and overdrafts (net of deferred finance costs) less
short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non
_IFRS Financial and Other Information”._

The following table sets forth certain key performance indicators for the Drax Group for the years ended 31 December
2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

**Description of Key Income Statement Line Items**

Set forth below is a brief description of the composition of the key line items of our consolidated income statement.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between Drax Group companies. Revenues
from the sale of electricity in the Generation segment are measured based upon output delivered at rates specified under
contracts or at prevailing market rates, as applicable. Revenues from sales of ROCs or LECs are stated at the invoiced value,
net of VAT. Revenue is recognised when the ROC or LEC is transferred to the account of that third-party. Revenue from the
sale of electricity directly to customers through the Retail segment is recorded after deduction of agreed discounts, VAT and
CCL. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price
has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy
supplied, but not yet measured or billed, is calculated based on consumption statistics and price estimates. Revenues from the
sale of wood pellets in the Retail segment through Billington Bioenergy are recognised at the point the wood pellets are
delivered to the location specified in the contract.

Other revenues derived from the provision of services (for example, the supply of Ancillary Services to the System
Operator) are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Most such contracts are for the delivery of a
service either continually or on an ad hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated with reference
to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in
extrapolating probable future outcomes.

Almost all sales of the Biomass Supply segment are inter-segment sales which are eliminated upon consolidation.

**_Total cost of sales_**

Total cost of sales consists of the cost of fuel required for electricity generation, the cost of transportation, the cost of
raw materials for the production of wood pellets, the cost of power purchases from third-parties, grid charges payable to the
System Operator, the operator of the electricity transmission network in Great Britain and other retail costs.

In the Generation segment, cost of fuel is the principal driver of total cost of sales and represents the cost of purchasing
the coal and sustainable biomass that is used to generate electricity in the Power Station (net of any ROC and LEC support
earned). ROCs and, until 1 August 2015, LECs earned from the biomass-fired generation units are initially recognised as a
reduction in the Generation segment’s biomass fuel costs and subsequently recognised as revenue when the ROC or LEC is
sold to a third-party. The initial reduction on the fuel costs is reversed at the time the revenue from the sale is recognised. The


-----

Generation segment also purchases electricity from the market either when it is more economical to do so because the market
price for electricity is lower than our marginal cost of production or when delivery obligations cannot be met by own
generation. Grid charges mainly comprise distribution, transmission and system balancing costs.

In the Retail segment cost of sales are mainly driven by power purchases. The Retail segment purchases a significant
proportion of its electricity requirement from the Generation segment under intra-group electricity purchase agreements.
Other costs of sales include third-party costs such as grid charges, the costs of meeting RO obligations and small-scale Feedin-Tariffs (“SS-FiT”) schemes, as well as, until 1 August 2015, the costs of LECs required to demonstrate the supply of
renewable, CCL-exempt energy to customers. Grid charges reflect costs of distribution, transmission and system balancing
costs.

In the Biomass Supply segment cost of sales are principally influenced by the price and type of raw fibre used in
producing the wood pellets. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities can process various types of raw fibre from primary
sources (such as thinnings, tops and harvesting residues) or secondary sources (such as chips, shavings or sawdust), with
secondary sources generally being more cost-effective compared to primary sources. Other costs of sales in the Biomass
Supply segment comprise costs of transport and other costs related to the production process.

**_Operating and administrative expenses_**

Operating and administrative expenses primarily consist of staff costs (such as wages and salaries, social security costs,
other pension costs and share based payments) and repairs and maintenance expenditure on property, plant and equipment.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA represents profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (including asset obsolescence charges and
losses on disposal) and excludes the impact of unrealised gains on derivative contracts and the impact of the settlement in
connection with the CESP in 2014. See “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information—Non IFRS Financial
_and Other Information”._

**_Depreciation and amortisation_**

Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset, or other amount substituted for cost,
less its residual value, over its useful life. Amortisation represents the systematic allocation of the cost of an intangible asset,
or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value, over its useful life.

**_Unrealised gains on derivative contracts_**

Unrealised gains on derivative contracts represents changes in fair value of derivative contracts at the relevant balance
sheet date, to the extent the derivatives contracts do not qualify for the own use exemption or as effective hedges in
accordance with IAS 39. The fair value of a derivative contract is generally the difference between the price we have secured
and the price we could achieve in the market at the time.

Derivative contracts qualify for the own use exemption if they are contracts for the delivery of physical commodities
entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage requirements (e.g., derivative contracts for physical coal or
sustainable biomass). Derivative contracts that qualify for the own use exemption are not accounted for using the fair market
value and therefore not included in unrealised gains on derivative contracts. In addition, changes in the fair market value of
derivative contracts that qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39 are accounted for in the hedge reserve and not in unrealised
gains on derivative contracts.

**_Interest payable and similar charges_**

Interest payable and similar charges reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable
on our bank loans) as well as foreign exchange gains and losses (for example, the non-cash effect of the revaluation of certain
assets that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling), the unwinding of discounting on provisions for the
reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives, net interest charges on our defined benefit pension scheme
obligations and other financing charges. The unwinding of discounting on provisions for the reinstatement of our sites at the
end of their useful lives relates to the provisions we are making for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the
useful life of our Power Station assets. The amount provided for represents the present fair value of these obligations (using a
risk-free pre-tax discount rate). The unwinding of such discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.

**_Interest income_**

Interest income represents income generated through the use of short-term cash surpluses, for example through
investments in money market funds or bank deposits.


-----

**_Tax_**

The total tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount payable on the taxable
profits of the relevant year (which is adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items
which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax). Deferred tax is an
accounting adjustment which reflects whether more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between
the accounting and tax rules. The tax charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the relevant year
and the movement in the deferred tax charge in that year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

**_Results of Operations for 2015 Compared to 2016_**

_Revenue_

The following table shows our total revenue and a breakdown of revenue by our segments for the years ended
31 December 2015 and 2016, respectively.

**Year ended 31 December**


**2015**


**2016**

**Total revenue ............................................................................................................** **3,065.0** **2,949.8**


-----

_Drax Group revenue_

Our total revenue after intra-group eliminations decreased by £115.2 million, or 3.8 per cent., to £2,949.8 million in
2016 from £3,065.0 million in 2015. This decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from our Generation segment which
were only partially offset by higher revenues from our Retail and Biomass Supply segments.

_Generation revenue_

Revenue from the Generation segment (including inter-segment sales) decreased by £147.3 million, or 5.6 per cent., to
£2,490.9 million in 2016 from £2,638.2 million in 2015 principally reflecting a significantly lower electricity output, slightly
lower average realised electricity prices and the first full year effect of the removal of the CCL exemption for renewable
generation from the biomass-fired generation units. Generation revenue in 2015 included £17 million of revenue from LECs,
earned prior to the withdrawal of the CCL exemption for generation from renewable sources in August 2015. Electricity
output from the Generation segment of 19.6 TWh in 2016 was significantly lower than 26.7 TWh in 2015, as a result of
lower electricity prices resulting in the coal-fired generation units being out of merit (and therefore not generating revenue for
most of the summer). In addition, 2016 was a particularly busy year for maintenance, which also contributed to lower
electricity output. A lower realised average wholesale electricity price of £48.3 per MWh in 2016, compared to £49.4 per
MWh in 2015, reflected the continued pressure on commodity prices.

These negative trends were partially mitigated by increased revenues from system balancing activity and the 12-month
Ancillary Services contract to provide black start capability awarded by the System Operator, which resulted in revenues
from Ancillary Services provided to the System Operator increasing from £14.0 million in 2015 to £47.3 million in 2016 as
well as increased ROC sales to third-parties of £366.7 million (2015: £290.8 million). Our CfD for our third biomass-fired
generation unit did not have a significant impact on the Generation segment’s revenue in 2016 as it only became effective in
the second half of December 2016.

_Retail revenue_

Revenue from the Retail segment increased by £36.4 million, or 2.8 per cent., to £1,326.4 million in 2016 from
£1290.0 million in 2015. There were no inter-segment sales in the Retail segment in 2015 and 2016. The increase in Retail
segment revenues was mainly due to growth in electricity sales by Haven Power from 13.8 TWh in 2015 to 14.6 TWh in
2016 (as a result of winning several large contracts) and strong sales volume growth at Billington Bioenergy. Haven Power’s
sales growth was mainly generated in the larger, but more competitive, I&C market. Lower average sales prices in the Haven
Power business due to lower wholesale electricity prices had a negative impact on revenue during 2016. The supply
arrangements with many of the larger customers of the Retail segment allow the customer flexibility to decide when to fix the
price of their electricity or to purchase their electricity at the prevailing market rates for the day or month ahead. Haven
Power purchases the electricity to fulfil the customer’s requirements at the same point in time at which the customer agrees to
fix a price allowing Haven Power to secure a fixed margin for these transactions. Therefore, while our revenue may fluctuate
depending on the wholesale electricity price, given the effective fixed margin of these flexible contracts this has a limited
impact on our profitability.

_Biomass Supply revenue_

Revenue from the Biomass Supply segment (including inter-segment sales) increased by £45.2 million, or 159.2 per
cent., to £73.6 million in 2016 from £28.4 million in 2015, reflecting the first full year of production at our U.S. wood pellet
manufacturing facilities. During 2016, the Biomass Supply segment produced approximately 607,000 tonnes of wood pellets
(2015: approximately 279,000 tonnes) and shipped approximately 558,000 tonnes of wood pellets (2015: approximately
243,000 tonnes).

The Biomass Supply segment sells wood pellets to the Generation segment under long-term intra-group supply
contracts at fixed prices. Therefore the Biomass Supply segment was largely insulated from the effects of falling spot prices
for wood pellets during 2016 as a result of excess supply caused by three consecutive warm winters and the delay in expected
increases in biomass demand in Europe, a major market for wood pellets. However, the Biomass Supply segment temporarily
curtailed its own production to allow the Generation segment to take advantage of the attractive pricing conditions on the
spot market for wood pellets during 2016.

_Intra-group elimination_

Intra-group eliminations increased by £49.5 million, or 5.6 per cent., from £891.6 million in 2015 to £941.1 million in
2016. Intra-group eliminations related to electricity and ROC sales from the Generation segment to the Retail segment
increased by £5.0 million, or 0.6 per cent., from £863.2 million in 2015 to £868.2 million in 2016 as a result of higher
electricity and ROC sales to Haven Power, offset only partially by lower averaged realised sale prices. Intra-group
eliminations related to sales of wood pellets from the Biomass Supply segment to the Generation segment increased by


-----

£44.5 million, or 156.7 per cent., from £28.4 million in 2015 to £72.9 million in 2016 due to higher wood pellet sales
volumes reflecting the first full year of production at our U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities.

_Total cost of sales_

In 2016 total cost of sales decreased by £82.8 million, or 3.1 per cent., to £2,573.4 million compared to
£2,656.2 million in 2015.

_Generation segment_

Cost of sales in the Generation segment decreased by £94.2 million, or 4.2 per cent., from £2,248.1 million in 2015 to
£2,153.9 million in 2016 due to lower fuel costs and grid charges driven by lower generation volumes, which effects were
only partially offset by higher costs of electricity purchases. Fuel costs decreased by £140.4 million, or 10.6 per cent., from
£1,320.5 million in 2015 to £1,180.1 million in 2016, primarily reflecting lower generation volumes, lower commodity prices
and higher ROC generation as a result of a third generation unit running as an enhanced co-firing unit for the majority of the
year prior to the conversion to biomass following the CfD state-aid approval. Commodity prices continued to be depressed
during 2016 and while the Generation segment procures a substantial part of its fuel needs under long-term supply contracts
at fixed prices, it was able to opportunistically benefit from lower spot prices for fuel. ROC generation continued to have a
significant impact on fuel costs as the expected benefit from ROCs earned from the biomass-fired generation units are
initially recognised as a reduction in the Generation segment’s biomass fuel costs and subsequently recognised as revenue
when the ROC is sold to a third-party.

Lower grid charges of £69.4 million in 2016 compared to £84.1 million in 2015 principally reflect the lower electricity
output of the Generation segment.

The volume of electricity purchases in the Generation segment, and as a result, the costs associated therewith, increased
from £843.5 million in 2015 to £904.4 million in 2016. Coal-fired generation units being out of merit during most of the
summer and therefore producing less electricity resulted in the Generation business increasing the volume of its electricity
purchases from third parties to meet its electricity delivery obligations under long-term electricity purchase contracts.
Because the cost of generation for the Generation segment would have been higher than the offtake price, the third-party
electricity purchases had a positive net impact on our EBITDA. The effect of such volume increase was only partially
mitigated by lower electricity prices paid to third-party suppliers.

_Retail segment_

Cost of sales in the Retail segment increased by £32.2 million, or 2.5 per cent., from £1,270.7 million in 2015 to
£1,302.9 million in 2016 as the cost of power purchases, grid charges and other retail costs rose. Higher electricity sales
resulted in the cost of electricity purchases increasing from £688.9 million in 2015 to £710.2 million in 2016, an effect that
was only partially mitigated by lower wholesale electricity prices. The Retail segment purchases a significant proportion of
its expected electricity needs under long- or medium-term supply agreements at fixed prices and the remainder under shortterm arrangements. Falling wholesale electricity prices therefore do not immediately translate into a corresponding fall in the
cost of power purchases for the Retail segment.

Third-party costs, such as grid charges (including distribution, transmission and system balancing costs)
(£310.4 million in 2016 compared to £285.4 million in 2015) and the costs of meeting Haven Power’s obligations under the
various renewable energy subsidies schemes (e.g., RO and SS-FiT schemes) continued to increase and represented
approximately 46 per cent. of the average realised price per MWh of electricity sold in 2016 compared to approximately
44 per cent. in 2015.

_Biomass Supply segment_

Cost of sales in the Biomass Supply segment increased by £28.1 million, or 102.6 per cent., from £27.4 million in 2015
to £55.5 million in 2016 reflecting the increased production volumes at our U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities. Raw
fibre procurement comprised the largest share of these costs and we continued the process of controlling these costs through a
combination of measures, including improved forecasting of utilisation and increased purchases or more cost-effective
feedstocks such as sawmill residues.

_Operating and administrative expenses_

Operating and administrative expenses decreased by £3.5 million, or 1.5 per cent., from £239.8 million in 2015 to
£236.3 million in 2016. In the Generation segment, operating and administrative expenses decreased by £12.3 million, or
7.0 per cent., from £175.5 million in 2015 to £163.3 million in 2016 as a result of cost savings and efficiency initiatives
despite a very high volume of repair and maintenance work. Operating and administrative expenses in the Retail segment
remained relatively stable at £27.8 million in 2016 compared to £25.6 million in 2015. In the Biomass Supply segment


-----

operating and administrative expenses increased significantly to £24.4 million in 2016 from £15.8 million in 2015 reflecting
the first full year of operation of our two U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities. Central operating and administrative
expenses attributable to the Drax Group amounted to £20.9 million in 2016 compared to £24.5 million in 2015. The decrease
reflects the impact of cost saving and efficiency initiatives which were only partially offset by the costs incurred in
connection with the acquisition of Opus and the OCGT projects.

_EBITDA_

The following table shows our EBITDA and a breakdown of the EBITDA for our Generation, Retail and Biomass
Supply segments for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2016, respectively.

**Year ended 31 December**


**2015**


**2016**


**(£ million)**
**EBITDA**
Generation ................................................................................................................ 214.6 173.8
Retail ......................................................................................................................... (6.3) (4.3)
Biomass Supply ........................................................................................................ (14.8) (6.3)

Consolidation adjustments ........................................................................................ — (2.3)

**Total ........................................................................................................................** **169.0** **140.0**

_Drax Group EBITDA_

Our EBITDA decreased by £29.0 million, or 17.2 per cent., to £140.0 million for 2016 from £169.0 million for 2015,
primarily due to lower revenues which were only partially offset by lower costs of sales and administrative and operating
costs. The loss of LEC support for electricity generated from renewable sources continued to have a negative impact on
EBITDA as EBITDA for 2015 benefited from £17 million of revenue from LEC sales. See “—Significant Factors Affecting
_Comparability of Financial Information—Loss of Climate Change Levy Exemption”. The consolidation adjustment represents_
adjustments made to the amount of intra-group stock held.

_Generation EBITDA_

EBITDA for the Generation segment decreased by £40.8 million, or 19.0 per cent., to £173.8 million for 2016 from
£214.6 million for 2015 reflecting the factors discussed above.

_Retail EBITDA_

EBITDA for the Retail segment increased by £2.0 million, or 31.7 per cent., to negative £4.3 million for 2016 from
negative £6.3 million for 2015 reflecting the factors discussed above.

_Biomass Supply EBITDA_

EBITDA for the Biomass Supply segment increased by £8.5 million, or 57.4 per cent., to negative £6.3 million for
2016 from negative £14.8 million for 2015 reflecting the factors discussed above.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation charges for increased by £9.1 million, or 9.1 per cent., to £109.5 million for 2016 from
£100.4 million for 2015, reflecting the higher asset base as a result of investments in our wood pellet manufacturing facilities
and the completion of the biomass transformation project at the Power Station.

_Unrealised gains on derivative contracts_

Unrealised gains on derivative contracts increased by £53.1 million, or 42.9 per cent., from £123.7 million in 2015 to
£176.8 million in 2016. This increase principally relates to forward currency purchase contracts and reflects the change in
mark-to-market value of our derivative contracts as the pound sterling weakened substantially against the U.S. dollar during
2016, the currency in which the majority of our fuel purchases are denominated. These gains were only partially offset by
lower mark-to-market values of our derivative contracts relating to commodities which fell as a result of the continued
pressure on commodity prices.


-----

_Operating profit_

Despite the decrease in EBITDA described above, operating profit increased by £127.6 million, or 167.9 per cent., to
£203.6 million in 2016 from £76.0 million in 2015. This increase is primarily due to the non-recurrence of asset obsolescence
charges primarily arising from the Generation segment of £109.2 million incurred in 2015 and to higher unrealised gains on
derivative contracts discussed above.

_Net interest charge_

Our net interest charge (defined as interest receivable less interest payable and similar charges) decreased by
£10.6 million, or 62.4 per cent., to £6.4 million in 2016 from £17.0 million in 2015. This decrease primarily reflects the noncash effect of the revaluation of certain assets that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling (including
intercompany loans denominated in U.S. dollars) (£22.0 million). The value of these assets measured in pounds sterling
increased during 2016 as a result of the pound sterling’s further depreciation against other major currencies, including the
U.S. dollar. Interest payable on bank borrowings remained largely stable at £19.4 million in 2016 (2015: £18.0 million).

_Tax_

Our total tax charge increased by £0.5 million, or 18.5 per cent., from £2.7 million in 2015 to £3.2 million in 2016. In
2016, the one-off non-cash deferred tax credits arising from the reduction of future UK corporation tax rates to 17 per cent.
from 2021 (£12 million) and the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with start-up losses in the Biomass Supply
segment for which we now consider the associated future tax benefit to be probable (£31.5 million) reduced the overall tax
charge.

Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) during 2016 were £1.7 million (2015: £3.8 million).

_Profit for the year_

Profit for the year increased by £137.6 million, or 244.4 per cent, from £56.3 million in 2015 to £193.9 million in 2016,
mainly reflecting the factors discussed above under “—Operating Profit” and the lower net interest charge.

_Revenue_

The following table shows our total revenue and a breakdown of revenue by our segments for the years ended
31 December 2014 and 2015, respectively.

**Year ended 31 December**


**2014**


**2015**


**(£ million)**
Revenue
Generation ..................................................................................................................... 2,449.8 2,638.2
Retail .............................................................................................................................. 1,090.4 1,290.0
Biomass Supply ............................................................................................................. — 28.4
Intra-group elimination .................................................................................................. (735.2) (891.6)

**Total revenue ...............................................................................................................** **2,805.0** **3,065.0**

_Drax Group revenue_

Our Total revenue after intra-group eliminations increased by £260.0 million, or 9.3 per cent., to £3,065.0 million in
2015 from £2,805.0 million in 2014. This increase was primarily due to higher revenue in our Generation and Retail
segments, which was only partially offset by an increase in intra-group eliminations.

_Generation revenue_

Revenue from the Generation segment (including inter-segment sales) increased by £188.4 million, or 7.7 per cent., to
£2,638.2 million in 2015 from £2,449.8 million in 2014 as a result of higher ROC sales as well as higher revenues from
electricity sales which were only partially offset by lower other income. We completed the conversion of our second
generation unit to sustainable biomass in May 2014, and 2015 included the first full year of generation from the second unit.
In addition, starting in 2015, a third generation unit was run as an enhanced co-fired generation unit burning significant
amounts of sustainable biomass. These factors contributed to revenue from ROC and LEC sales increasing by £137.0 million
or 43.5 per cent. to £451.8 million in 2015 from £314.8 million in 2014, despite the fact that the CCL-exemption for the


-----

generation of electricity from renewable sources was withdrawn effective 1 August 2015 and we therefore ceased to earn
LECs for the electricity generated from our biomass-fired generation units after such date.

Electricity output remained stable at 26.7 TWh and average realised electricity prices fell to £49.4 per MWh from
£51.4 per MWh in 2014 mainly reflecting lower commodity prices, in particular for gas. Despite lower average realised
electricity prices and nearly unchanged output, revenue from electricity sales increased by 4.0 per cent. to £2,163.4 million in
2015 from £2,079.9 million in 2014. The increase is mainly due to higher revenues from the sale of third-party electricity
purchased in the wholesale market. Lower wholesale electricity prices during 2015 meant that it was increasingly more
economical for the Generation segment to cover its delivery obligations under fixed price supply agreements by purchasing
electricity in the wholesale market rather than generating it at the Power Station. This development also led to an increase in
the costs of power purchases discussed below under “—Total costs of sales—Generation segment”.

_Retail revenue_

Revenue from the Retail segment increased by £199.6 million, or 18.3 per cent., to £1,290.0 million in 2015 from
£1,090.4 million in 2014 as a result of higher sales from Haven Power and the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy. There
were no inter-segment sales in the Retail segment in 2014 and 2015. Net electricity sales by Haven Power increased from
11.8 TWh in 2014 to 13.8 TWh in 2015. The sales growth was mainly generated in the larger, but more competitive, I&C
market.

These factors were only partially offset by lower average sales prices in the Haven Power business due to lower
wholesale electricity prices. The supply arrangements with many of our larger Retail segment customers allow the customer
flexibility to decide when to fix the price of their electricity or to purchase their electricity at the prevailing market rates for
the day or month ahead. As a result, the declining wholesale electricity price had a negative impact on Haven Power’s
revenue in 2015.

Revenue from the Retail segment also benefitted from the consolidation of Billington Bioenergy following its
acquisition by us in March 2015. In 2015, Billington Bioenergy delivered retail wood pellet sales of approximately 26,000
tonnes and revenues of £4.7 million.

_Biomass Supply revenue_

Revenue from the Biomass Supply segment increased to £28.4 million in 2015 from nil in 2014 reflecting the
completion and commissioning of our two U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities and the related port facility. In 2015, the
Biomass Supply segment produced approximately 279,000 tonnes of wood pellets and shipped approximately 243,000 tonnes
of wood pellets to the UK.

_Intra-group elimination_

Intra-group eliminations increased by £156.4 million, or 21.2 per cent., from £735.2 million in 2014 to £891.6 million
in 2015. Intra-group eliminations related to electricity sales from the Generation segment to the Retail segment increased by
£128.0 million, or 17.4 per cent., from £735.2 million in 2014 to £863.2 million in 2015 as a result of higher electricity, ROC
and LEC sales to Haven Power which were only partly offset by lower prices. Additionally, intra-group eliminations related
to sales of wood pellets from the Biomass Supply segment to the Generation segment, which increased from nil in 2014 to
£28.4 million in 2015 due to the start of wood pellet manufacturing at our two U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities in
2015.

_Total cost of sales_

In 2015 total cost of sales increased by £301.0 million, or 12.8 per cent., to £2,656.2 million compared to £2,355.2 million in
2014.

_Generation segment_

Cost of sales in the Generation segment increased by £231.4 million, or 11.5 per cent., from £2,016.7 million in 2014
to £2,248.1 million in 2015 due to higher fuel costs, cost of power purchases and grid charges. Fuel costs increased by
£96.7 million, or 7.9 per cent., from £1,223.8 million in 2014 to £1,320.5 million in 2015, primarily reflecting a change in the
fuel mix and higher costs of emissions allowances. 2015 saw the first full year of the second converted generation unit
running on biomass and the conversion of the third generation unit to enhanced co-fired generation, resulting in increased
biomass requirements. Since the fuel cost for producing a MWh of electricity from biomass is higher than the fuel costs for a
MWh of electricity generated from coal, we experienced an overall increase in fuel cost. These factors were only partially
offset by increased ROC generation following the conversion of a second generation unit to biomass and the conversion of
the third generation unit to enhanced co-fired generation. ROCs earned from the biomass-fired generation units are initially
recognised as a reduction in the Generation segment’s biomass fuel costs and subsequently recognised as revenue when the
ROC is sold to a third-party.


-----

Costs of power purchases in the Generation segment increased from £710.4 million in 2014 to £843.5 million in 2015.
This increase mainly resulted from the coal-fired generation units being increasingly out of merit during the summer and the
corresponding need to purchase electricity in the wholesale market to cover delivery obligations.

Despite stable electricity output, grid charges for 2015 increased to £84.1 million compared to £81.5 million in 2014
due to higher grid charges per MWh.

_Retail Segment_

Cost of sales in the Retail segment increased by £81.2 million, or 12.9 per cent., from £629.0 million in 2014 to
£710.2 million in 2015, principally reflecting higher cost of power purchases and higher third-party costs as a result of the
increase in electricity sales discussed above, which were only partially offset by lower wholesale electricity purchase prices.
Third-party costs, such as grid charges (including distribution, transmission and system balancing costs) and the costs of
meeting Haven Power’s obligations under the various renewable energy subsidies schemes (e.g. RO, SS-FiT schemes and the
costs of LECs) continued to increase and represented approximately 44 per cent. of the average realised price per MWh of
electricity sold in 2015 compared to approximately 41 per cent. in 2014.

_Biomass Supply segment_

Cost of sales in the Biomass Supply segment increased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the commencement of
commercial operations of our two U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities and the purchases of raw material, mainly fibre,
and transport costs in connection therewith. Raw materials costs were higher than expected in the beginning of 2015 as the
wood pellet manufacturing facilities progressed through the start-up and commissioning phase, but started to fall in the
second half of 2015 as the optimisation of the operations progressed.

_Operating and administrative expenses_

Operating and administrative expenses increased by £19.4 million, or 8.8 per cent., from £220.4 million in 2014 to
£239.8 million in 2015, mainly due to an increase in such expenses in the Biomass Supply segment. In the Generation
segment operating and administrative expenses decreased by £13.8 million, or 7.3 per cent., to £175.5 million in 2015 from
£189.3 million in 2014. These expenses mainly relate to costs incurred in connection with planned maintenance at the Power
Station, the modifications required to enable the third generation unit to be converted to biomass and the write-off of certain
maintenance spare parts which became obsolete as a result of these modifications. Despite a high volume of planned
maintenance work and the work carried out in connection with the conversion of the third generation unit to biomass in 2015,
operating and administrative expenses in the Generation segment fell. This decrease in operating administrative expenses is
principally due to the effect central operating costs, which were previously reported within the Generation segment, being
reported separately for the first time in 2015.

Operating and administrative expenses in the Retail segment amounted to £25.6 million in 2015 compared to
£22.2 million in 2014.

In the Biomass Supply segment, the commencement of commercial operations of our two U.S. wood pellet
manufacturing facilities resulted in operating and administrative expenses increasing by £6.9 million, or 77.5 per cent. from
£8.9 million in 2014 to £15.8 million in 2015.

Central operating and administrative expenses amounted to £24.5 million in 2015. As we did not analyse central
operating costs prior to 2015, no comparable figure for 2014 is available.

_EBITDA_

The following table shows our EBITDA and a breakdown of the EBITDA for our Generation, Retail and Biomass
Supply segments for 2014 and 2015, respectively.

**Year**

**2014** **2015**

**(£ million)**
**EBITDA**
Generation ........................................................................................................................................ 244.8 214.6
Retail ................................................................................................................................................. (5.5) (6.3)
Biomass supply ................................................................................................................................. (9.9) (14.8)
Central costs ..................................................................................................................................... — (24.5)

**Total ................................................................................................................................................** **229.4** **169.0**


-----

_Drax Group EBITDA_

Our EBITDA decreased by £60.4 million, or 26.3 per cent., to £169.0 million in 2015 from £229.4 million in 2014,
primarily due to the loss of the CCL exemption for the electricity generated from our converted generation units following
the changes to the CCL regime that became effective on 1 August 2015 and the increase in total cost of sales and operating
and administrative expenses discussed above, which were only partially offset by higher revenues. See “—Significant Factors
_Affecting Comparability of Financial Information—Loss of Climate Change Levy Exemption”._

_Generation EBITDA_

EBITDA for the Generation segment decreased by £30.2 million, or 12.3 per cent., to £214.6 million in 2015 from
£244.8 million in 2014, reflecting the factors discussed above.

_Retail EBITDA_

EBITDA for the Retail segment decreased by £0.8 million, or 15 per cent., to negative £6.3 million in 2015 from
negative £5.5 million in 2014, reflecting the factors discussed above.

_Biomass Supply EBITDA_

EBITDA for the Biomass Supply segment decreased by £4.9 million, or 49.5 per cent., to negative £14.8 million in
2015 from negative £9.9 million in 2014, reflecting the factors discussed above.

_Depreciation and amortisation_

Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by £19.7 million, or 24.4 per cent., to £100.4 million for 2015 from
£80.7 million for 2014, reflecting the higher asset base as a result of the investments in our wood pellet manufacturing
facilities and the biomass transformation project at the Power Station.

_Unrealised gains on derivative contracts_

Unrealised gains on derivative contracts increased by £57.9 million, or 88.0 per cent., from £65.8 million in 2014 to
£123.7 million in 2015. This increase was mainly due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the pound
sterling on the value of our foreign currency exchange contracts. Falling electricity and gas prices during 2015 contributed
further unrealised gains on derivative contracts, as our hedged position was at a better price than the market price. These
gains were partially offset by unrealised losses on financial oil purchases as a result of the continuing decline of oil prices
during 2015.

_Operating profit_

Operating profit decreased by £118.5 million, or 60.9 per cent., to £76 million in 2015 from £194.5 million in 2014,
primarily as a result of lower gross profit, higher operating and administrative expenses, higher depreciation and amortisation
charges and asset obsolescence charges of £109.2 million (2014: nil). The asset obsolescence charges primarily relate to a
decision to decommission the flue-gas desulphurisation (“FGD”) technology within our Generation segment as it was no
longer required on the generation units converted to biomass, which resulted in an asset obsolescence charge of
£92.6 million. The remaining asset obsolescence charges in 2015 relate to a decision to abandon the development of a
technology solution to comply with the IED, which had become redundant following the decision to implement a competing
solution (£10.0 million) and to a decision not to proceed with a third wood pellet manufacturing project in the U.S. (£6.6
million).

These developments were partially offset by the one-time Ofgem settlement incurred in connection with our failure to
comply with our obligations under the CESP (2014: £20.0 million), which did not recur in 2015.

_Net interest charge_

Our net interest charge (defined as interest receivable less interest payable and similar charges) decreased by
£11.6 million, or 40.6 per cent., to £17.0 million in 2015 from £28.6 million in 2014, reflecting mainly an increase in foreign
exchange gains of £11.4 million to £5.9 million in 2015 from a foreign exchange loss of £5.5 million in 2014. The foreign
exchange gains relate to the revaluation of certain assets that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling
(including intercompany loans denominated in U.S. dollars). The value of these assets measured in pounds sterling increased
during 2015 as a result of the pound sterling’s depreciation against other major currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Interest
payable on bank borrowings remained largely stable at £18.0 million in 2015 (2014: £16.8 million).


-----

_Tax_

Our total tax charge amounted to £2.7 million in 2015, a decrease of £34.5 million, or 92.7 per cent., compared to
£37.2 million in 2014. This decrease principally reflects the reduction in profit before tax in 2015 compared to 2014 and a
£17.8 million impact from the 2 per cent. reduction in corporation tax rate during 2015.

Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were £3.8 million and £14.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, principally
reflecting lower underlying profit before tax.

_Profit for the year_

Profit for the year decreased to £56.3 million in 2015 from £128.7 million in 2014, a decrease of £72.4 million or
56.3 per cent., reflecting the factors discussed above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

We are financed through a combination of cash generated from operations, drawings under the New Revolving
Facility, proceeds of arrangements in respect of receivables, from long-term financing arrangements (which, following the
issue of the Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds”, will consist of the Notes and the
New Term Loan). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”. Liquidity, including short-term working capital
requirements, is primarily financed through arrangements in respect of receivables together with available cash resources. As
at 31 December 2016, there was £111.1 million utilised under ROC Agreements and £74.4 million utilised under receivable
financing agreements.

The following table summarises our cash flow activity for 2014, 2015 and 2016.

**Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents** ................................................. **(86.4)** **(49.0)** **86.7**

**_Cash generated from operations_**

Cash generated from operations was £213.1 million in 2016 compared to £166.0 million in 2015, primarily reflecting
lower working capital requirements as a result of efficiency initiatives, a new receivables securitisation programme and a
reduction of ROCs held on balance sheet which more than offset lower profit for the year.

Despite a lower EBITDA, cash generated from operations in 2015 was £166.0 million compared to £127.3 million in
2014, as a result of lower working capital requirements which effect was partially offset by an increase in ROC assets due to
higher electricity output from biomass.


-----

_Changes in working capital (other than Generation segment carbon assets and ROC and LEC assets)_

Our working capital mainly comprises fuel inventories (biomass and coal) in the Generation segment and feedstock and
wood pellet inventories in the Biomass Supply segment. In our Retail segment, working capital mainly comprises trade
payables related to the obligation to procure a sufficient number of ROCs and trade receivables against customers.

Net cash inflow from changes in working capital (other than Generation segment carbon assets and ROC and LEC
assets) was £38.8 million in 2016 compared to £93.7 million in 2015. Inventories increased by £63.5 million in 2016
compared to a decrease of £18.0 million in 2015 primarily as a result of increased biomass stock to cater for the increased
biomass requirements. Receivables decreased by £28.6 million in 2016 (2015: decrease of £48.9 million) driven by lower
accounts receivables in the Retail segment following the execution of the Haven Power MRTSA in the first half of 2016.
Payables increased by £73.7 million in 2016 (2015: increase by £26.8 million) mainly due to higher ROC payables in the
Retail segment reflecting higher electricity sales to end-customers.

Net cash inflow from changes in our working capital (other than Generation segment carbon assets and ROC and LEC
assets) was £93.7 million in 2015 compared to a net outflow of £83.9 million in 2014, reflecting lower sales volumes in the
Generation segment and our efforts to manage our working capital more efficiently. The inflow was mainly driven by a
decrease in receivables of £48.9 million (2014: increase by £116.3 million), reflecting lower sales volumes. Lower
inventories, mainly as a result of a controlled run-down of coal stocks, contributed to a cash inflow of £18.0 million in 2015
compared to a cash outflow of £45.9 million in 2014. Payables increased by £26.8 million in 2015 (2014: increase by £78.3
million) mainly due to higher ROC payables in the Retail segment reflecting higher electricity sales to end-customers.

_(Increase)/decrease in carbon assets_

Carbon assets are emissions allowances purchased and held by us to be used in the relevant year pursuant to EU ETS.

Carbon assets decreased by £11.1 million in 2016 compared to an increase by £11.8 million in 2015. In 2015, carbon
assets increased by £11.8 million compared to a decrease by £26.5 million in 2014. We purchase carbon assets in advance
based on our estimated generation from coal during each year. Increases and decreases in carbon assets therefore mainly
reflect lower or higher generation from coal than originally estimated. In addition, the market for carbon assets is most liquid
towards the end of each calendar year and we may opportunistically purchase or sell significant amounts of carbon assets
towards the end of the calendar year, making the amount of carbon assets held on balance sheet at year end susceptible to
volatility.

_Increase in ROC and LEC assets_

The value of ROCs and, until August 2015, LECs created in the Generation segment is held in the balance sheet until
these assets are sold to a third-party. The timing of such sale is driven by RO deadlines and commercial considerations,
resulting in a time lag between the time at which the ROCs and LECs are booked in the balance sheet and the time at which
the purchase price for these assets is realised. We have facilities in place to accelerate cash flows from invoices issued in
relation to ROC sales.

ROC and LEC assets decreased by £12.5 million in 2016 compared to an increase of £85.6 million in 2015. The
decrease in ROC and LEC assets in 2016 principally reflects improvements to our trading activities that allowed us to realise
an increasing portion of the ROCs earned early and accelerate the cash flows from these assets which, for the first time, offset
the impact of additional ROCs earned as the generation of electricity from biomass increased. With the conversion of the
third generation unit to biomass the number of ROCs earned will be lower going forward with a corresponding benefit on our
cash flow. The third biomass-fired generation unit was run as an enhanced co-fired unit burning coal and biomass before
19 December 2016 and received ROCs for the proportion of electricity produced from biomass. Following the completion of
the conversion to biomass and the effectiveness of our CfD on 19 December 2016, this generation unit no longer receives
ROC support. However, these effects also limits the potential for further positive cash flow effects from ROC-realisation
programmes as the amount of ROCs held as working capital decreases.

ROC and LEC assets increased by £85.6 million in 2015 compared to an increase by £45.0 million in 2014. The
increase in ROC and LEC assets in 2015 mainly resulted from higher electricity generation from biomass, with 2015 being
the first full year following the conversion of the second generation unit in the Power Station to biomass.

**_Cash flows from investing activities_**

Net cash used in investing activities was £93.2 million in 2016 compared to £143.0 million in 2015 and comprised
purchases of property, plant and equipment only. The decrease compared to 2015 primarily reflects lower spend on the
biomass conversion project following its completion and lower maintenance capital expenditure with respect to the
generation units, partially offset by continued investment in our U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities. Capital
expenditure for maintenance and repair was relatively low in 2016 despite a busy maintenance schedule reflecting the
reduced maintenance programme for the coal-fired generation units.


-----

Net cash used in investing activities was £143.0 million in 2015 compared to £220.2 million in 2014. Purchases of
property plant and equipment amounted to £179.1 million and £200.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are
reflective of our investments in our two U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities, the conversion of a third generation unit to
biomass, investments in an emission reducing technology for the generation units at the Power Station to make these IEDcompliant and investments in connection with the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy. Purchases of property, plant and
equipment in 2014 mainly comprised investments in our two U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities and the conversion of
a second generation unit to biomass. We also realised a cash inflow of £40.1 million in 2015 from the redemption of shortterm investments which were converted into cash.

**_Cash flows from financing activities_**

Net cash absorbed by financing activities was £10.9 million in 2016 compared to net cash absorbed by financing
activities of £54.1 million in 2015, reflecting primarily the dividends paid to the shareholders of Drax Group plc (2016: £11.0
million). Net cash absorbed by financing activities was £54.1 million in 2015 compared to net cash from financing activities
of £44.1 million in 2014. The net cash outflow in 2015 mainly reflects the dividends paid to the shareholders of Drax Group
plc (£49.9 million). In 2014 the cash outflow resulting from the dividends paid to shareholders of Drax Group plc (£55.0
million) was more than offset by the cash inflow from a drawdown of £100.0 million under loan facilities in connection with
the biomass transformation.

**_Capital expenditure_**

Our capital expenditure amounted to £200.6 million, £173.8 million and £95.7 million in 2014, 2015 and 2016,
respectively. For the year ending 31 December 2017, we expect capital expenditure to be broadly in line with 2016 (except
for the additional capital expenditure related to the acquisition of the assets of Louisiana Pellets (initial auction price of US$
35.4 million and additional capital expenditure for ramp up of production), investments in additional capacity at our existing
U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities (approximately US$15 million), initial investments in connection with our four
OCGT projects and the purchase of a new office building by Opus (approximately £9 million)). Other capital expenditure is
expected to comprise mainly relate to strategic spares (i.e. large equipment for the Power Station with long lead times that we
keep on-site to reduce the risk of prolonged unplanned outages) and in our IT systems in the Retail segment. In the medium
term, we expect that our capital expenditure will be principally dependent on the decision as to whether and when to pursue
the development of the four OCGT projects acquired in December 2016. If developed, these OCGT power plants could
become operational between 2020 and 2024 and to require an investment of approximately £80 million to £100 million each.
See “—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Capital Expenditure” for more detail.

**_Other contractual obligations_**

The following table sets out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments held by us
as at 31 December 2016, which are marked-to-market, based on the undiscounted net cash inflow or outflow. Where the
amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected
commodity price, or foreign exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing as at 31 December
2016.

**Total .................................................................................................** **3,510.3** **982.2** **845.8** **1,682.3**

We have a number of contractual commitments (i.e., a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future)
that are not recorded in the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such
commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts
for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services. The table below sets out these commitments as at
31 December 2015 and 2016, respectively.

**Total ......................................................................................................................................** **4,739.0** **5,194.4**

Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers,
primarily for the delivery of sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at the Power Station over the period
from 2017–2027. To the extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in the
Drax Group Audited Financial Statements owing to application of the “own-use” exemption from fair value accounting to
such contracts.

Our future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December 2015 and
2016, respectively, are set out in the table below. See “— _Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements—Recent Accounting_
_Announcements”._

**Total ......................................................................................................................................** **23.1** **19.7**

**Contingent Liabilities**

As at 31 December 2016, we had contingent liabilities in respect of letters of credit issued on behalf of certain
members of the Drax Group by a number of banks in an amount of £57.9 million (as at 31 December 2015: £37.9 million).

The Government has announced its intention to implement legislation to equalise the guaranteed minimum pension
(“GMP”), resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would correspondingly increase our defined benefit
pension obligation (see “—Pensions”). At present, the methodology for implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus
the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in the calculation of
the defined benefit obligation within the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements.

**Pensions**

We operate a defined benefit and three defined contribution pension schemes. The Drax Power Group section of the
Electricity Supply Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme under which participating members are entitled to a pension
on retirement based on their final pensionable salary. This scheme has been closed to new members as from 1 January 2002.
The Drax Power Limited Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(k) Plan are defined
contribution schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by us and
members of the scheme.

Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered a service that
entitles them to the contributions. For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using
the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each year. Remeasurement of the
obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets
(excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive
income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains
and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised within the income statement as part of operating and administrative
expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is recognised within finance costs.

The below table sets out the costs for the defined benefit scheme for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

**Total ......................................................................................................................................** **7.7** **7.5** **6.9**

The last funding valuation of the Drax Power Group section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme was carried out
as of 31 March 2016. The below table sets out the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligations and
the fair value of the plan assets as at 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. This difference is recognised in our
balance sheet.

**As at 31 December**


**2014**


**2015**


**2016**


**(£ million)**
Defined benefit obligations .............................................................................................. (242.1) (244.6) (311.4)
Fair value of plan assets ................................................................................................... 207.8 215.1 281.3

**(Deficit) ..........................................................................................................................** **(34.3)** **(29.5)** **(30.1)**

The total amounts related to the defined contribution pension schemes recognised in our income statement for each of
2016, 2015 and 2014 amounted to £5.6 million, £5.9 million and £4.9 million, respectively.

**Dividend Policy**

Our ability and intention to pay dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, results of operation,
capital requirements, investment alternatives and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. We expect that the principal
source of funds for the payment of dividends, if any, will be cash generated from operating activities.

Drax Group plc paid dividends to its shareholders in an aggregate amount of £11.0 million in 2016 and £49.9 million in
2015. Our current dividend policy is to return 50 per cent. of underlying profit to our shareholders each year.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk**

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign
currency rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. Our overall risk management programme focuses on the
unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on our financial
performance.

We use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposure. Risk management is carried out by risk
management committees, which seek to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination with our trading
function under policies approved by the Board.

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

We are exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal,
the price of sustainable biomass, the costs of transporting biomass such as oil and freight, and the price of emissions
allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced our financial results and are expected to continue
to do so.

We have a policy of securing forward electricity sales, purchases of fuel and emissions allowances when profitable to
do so. All commitments to sell electricity under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce our
cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.

We purchase coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different
maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted
at a fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow
hedges as they reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal. We purchase emissions
allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and international sources. All
commitments to purchase emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce
our cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of emissions allowances.


-----

If commodity prices had been 5 per cent. higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our profit after tax for
2016 would increase/decrease by £3.4 million (2015: decrease/increase by £6.7 million). If commodity prices had been 5 per
cent. higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our hedge reserve at the end of 2016 would decrease/increase
by £36.3 million (2015: increase/decrease by £11.5 million), mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of financial
coal and power derivatives.

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding
monetary items at 31 December 2016 and 2015, respectively. The analysis is based on our commodity financial instruments
held as at 31 December 2016 and 2015, respectively.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Historically we have been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to our bank debt, and have sought to
mitigate this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of our debt facilities. We had no interest rate swaps outstanding as
at 31 December 2016; however, this risk management tool remains available to us.

If interest rates had been 1 per cent. higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, our profit after tax and net
assets for 2016 would decrease/increase by £1.8 million (2015: decrease/increase by £1.8 million) as a result of the changes
in interest payable during the period.

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative
instruments as at 31 December 2016 and 2015, respectively. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the
amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

We are exposed to foreign currency risk in connection with coal purchases in U.S. dollars, biomass purchases in U.S.
dollars, Canadian dollars and euro, freight and other associated transportation costs (e.g. oil) in U.S. dollars and emissions
allowances purchases in euro. Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge this exposure. As our biomass
transformation plans have progressed, we have entered into an increasing volume of foreign exchange contracts.

If pound sterling exchange rates had been 5 per cent. stronger/weaker against other currencies in 2016 and all other
variables were held constant, our profit after tax for 2016 would decrease/increase by £252.6 million/£277.7 million (2015:
decrease/increase by £233.3 million/£241.1 million). This is mainly attributable to our exposure to foreign currency exchange
contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts. If pound sterling exchange rates had been 5 per cent. stronger/weaker
against other currencies in 2016 and all other variables were held constant, our other equity reserves would increase/decrease
by £78.7 million/£87.0 million (2015: increase/decrease by £67.8 million/£75.0 million) as a result of the changes in the fair
value of foreign currency exchange contracts.

**_Counterparty Risk_**

As we rely on third-party suppliers for the delivery of fuel, a large portion of our sustainable biomass and other goods
and services, we are exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third-party suppliers. If a large supplier falls into
financial difficulty and/or fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel
from other suppliers.

We enter into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure
of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause us financial distress or increase our
risk profile. In 2016, we derived revenues of £541.5 million and £399.3 million (2015: £597.7 million and £468.0 million)
from two customers, each representing more than 10 per cent. of our consolidated revenue for the respective year. These
revenues arose in the Generation segment.

**_Credit Risk_**

We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our investments of cash and cash equivalents, other short term
investments, the debtors of our trade and other receivables as well as the counterparties to our derivative financial
instruments.

Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees.
Where considered appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company
guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate we have purchased credit
default swaps.

The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within approved policies. These policies manage
credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investments with any one counterparty and the
maturity profile.


-----

Our exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as
summarised in the following table:

**As at 31 December**


**2015**


**2016**


**(£ million)**
Cash and cash equivalents ...................................................................................................... 133.8 228.4
Trade and other receivables .................................................................................................... 292.9 319.3
Derivative financial instruments ............................................................................................. 609.2 891.3

**Total ......................................................................................................................................** **1,035.9** **1,439.0**

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements**

The Drax Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. In connection with the
preparation of the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements, the directors of Drax Group plc are required to make
assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical
experience, trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the Drax Group Audited Financial
Statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and
judgments to ensure that the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements are presented fairly and in accordance with IFRS.
However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from its
assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

Management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management’s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over its useful economic life. Estimated useful
lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence; however, a degree of judgment is
required.

**_Asset Impairment_**

We conduct impairment tests annually for goodwill and for other fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets
known as cash-generation units (“CGUs”)) when an indicator of possible impairment exists. We consider the smallest
collection of assets that generate independent cash flows to be our operating entities (Drax Power, Haven Power, Drax
Biomass and Billington Bioenergy) and accordingly consider the Drax Group to be comprised of four CGUs. If an indication
of a potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the
future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU or the expected price that would be
received to sell the asset or CGU to another market participant. If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying
amount within the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the
recoverable amount. The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent
upon a number of assumptions. In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon the reasonable estimates of future
prices, output, costs and economic support for renewable energy production by management.

In 2015, our market capitalisation fell materially below the carrying value of our net assets. While the shortfall has
reduced considerably during 2016, this remained the case as at 31 December 2016. In addition, commodity markets are weak
and the substantial weakening of the pound sterling against both the euro and the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2016
indicated a potentially material increase in the long-term costs of fuel for the Generation segment, which are primarily priced
in these currencies. Accordingly, an impairment review of the Drax Power CGU was undertaken as at 31 December 2016. A
review of other CGUs suggested no indicators of impairment and no impairment charge was taken.

**_Derivatives_**

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Drax Group Audited Financial Statements at fair value. The
assessment of fair value depends upon assuming a market price for the instrument in question. We base our assessment of
market prices upon forward curves that are largely derived from readily attainable quotations and third-party sources.
However, any forward curve is based at least in part on assumptions around future transactions and market movements.
Where derivative instruments extend beyond the liquid portion of the forward curve, the level of judgment increases as the
number of observable transactions decreases. Where derivative financial instruments include options, these are valued using


-----

an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option,
discount rates and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements. These inputs include assumptions around
future transactions and market movements and are therefore subjective.

**_Inventories_**

Fuel inventories are valued at weighted average cost based on purchase price, or net realisable value where lower.
Valuation is largely based on observable data (such as invoiced costs and automated weigher readings). However, given the
bulk nature of fuels an element of judgment is required to assess the volume of stock held at the balance sheet date.

**_ROCs_**

The carrying amount of ROCs in our balance sheet are stated at their expected realisable value, taking into account
anticipated sales prices, and agreed forward sale contracts, where appropriate. ROC valuations also include an estimate of the
future benefits that may be obtained from the recycle fund at the end of the compliance period. Such estimates are subject to
assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and thus subject to
uncertainty.

**_Pensions_**

We record a liability in our balance sheet for our obligation to provide benefits under an approved defined benefits
pension scheme less the fair value of assets held by the pension scheme. The actuarial valuation of the scheme assets and
liabilities is performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation, future salary and pension
increases, mortality and other factors.

**_Revenue recognition_**

The nature of some of our activities, particularly within the Retail segment, results in revenue being based on the
estimated volumes of power supplied to customers at an estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that underpin these
estimates are applied consistently and comparison of past estimates to final settlements suggests a high degree of accuracy.
However, given the level of judgment involved, actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.

**_Recent Accounting Announcements_**

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective are disclosed below. We intend to adopt these
standards, if applicable, when they become effective:

    - IFRS 9—Financial Instruments—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

    - IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2018.

    - IFRS 16 (amended)—Leases—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.

    - IFRS 10 (amended)—Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) Investments in Associates and Joint
Ventures (2011)—effective date deferred indefinitely.

    - IAS 12 (amended)—Income Taxes—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.

    - IAS 7 (amended)—Statement of Cash Flows—effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.

    - IFRIC 22—Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration—effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

    - IAS 40 (amended)—Investment Property—effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January
2018.

Following endorsement by the EU, we expect to adopt IFRS 9 in line with the 1 January 2018 effective date. The
adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the recognition or measurement of our financial
instruments. However, following adoption it is anticipated that more of our forward purchase contracts will in future qualify
for hedge accounting under the new standard than under the existing standard. This is expected to result in a greater
proportion of unrealised gains and losses being recognised in the hedge reserve and an associated reduction in income
statement volatility.

We are in the process of completing a preliminary impact assessment for the adoption of IFRS 15, which is expected to
be adopted in line with the effective date of 1 January 2018. While further work is required, we expect to review and update
our revenue recognition policies in light of the updated requirements. Based on the initial findings of this process, a material
change to the quantum and timing of profitability is considered unlikely at this stage.


-----

We have not yet concluded our initial impact assessment into the adoption of IFRS 16; however, at this stage the
standard is not expected to have a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of amounts within the
financial statements in respect of leases. We currently expect to adopt IFRS 16 in the period it becomes mandatory, subject to
endorsement by the EU.

Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of the Drax Group.

**Overview**

Founded in 2002, we are a business to business (“B2B”) supplier of electricity, gas and related services in the UK,
employing approximately 870 people across Northampton, Oxford and Cardiff. We are the UK’s largest non-domestic
electricity supplier outside of the Big Six based on number of customers, with an established customer base and a nondomestic market share of approximately 8.4 per cent. (by electricity meter count) as at 31 October 2016. As at 31 October
2016, we also were the UK’s sixth largest non-domestic electricity supplier (by meters) and the seventh largest gas supplier
(by meters). We supplied 3.9 TWh of electricity and 1.5 TWh of gas in the financial year ended 31 March 2016 and 2.8 TWh
of electricity and 1.3 TWh of gas in the nine month-period ended 31 December 2016. Compared to Haven Power, which
operates both in the large I&C and SME markets, we are focused on SME customers. We have two core divisions made up of
“small”, predominantly single site SME customers and larger “corporate” multi-site SME customers.

Compared with the I&C market, the SME market is characterised by lower energy consumption per meter and higher
gross margins per MWh with higher customer retention rates. A large share of contracts is entered into via third-party
intermediaries (“TPIs”) in the SME market and, in comparison to the I&C market, customer bad debt as a proportion of
revenue is on average higher. During the year ended 31 March 2016, we retained over 85 per cent. of our customers and in
Datamonitor’s 2014 B2B energy buyer customer satisfaction survey, we were ranked first for customer service in the UK.

We also provide certain “white labelling” and/or software services to Statkraft, Telecom Plus plc and Green Energy
(UK) plc. White labelling services allow businesses that are not accredited or licensed to supply energy to their customers to
work with us (being appropriately accredited and licensed) to supply those customers. The software services provided allow
some limited use of separate instances of our proprietary software. The arrangements with Statkraft are due to terminate in
the next 12 months and will not be renewed.

**Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Our operating results are affected by a combination of economic and industry- and company-specific factors. Economic
conditions influence electricity demand and the wholesale electricity price, which affects both our revenues and our costs.
Industry-specific factors include innovation in technology and competition. Factors that specifically impact our operating


-----

results include, but are not limited to, the ability to retain existing and win new customers, the ability to pass-on third-party
costs and customer bad debt provisions. The most significant of such factors are discussed below.

**_Demand for Electricity and Gas_**

Demand for electricity and gas in the UK is a key driver of our revenues and affects both volumes and margins for
electricity and gas supplied to customers. Demand for electricity and gas has historically been correlated to changes in gross
domestic product and the wider macroeconomic climate. More recently, improved energy efficiency and higher average
temperatures has negatively impacted demand for gas and electricity, with the average consumption per customer decreasing
slightly since 2015.

**_Wholesale Electricity and Gas Prices_**

Wholesale electricity and gas prices affect both our revenues and our costs, and the ability to pass increases in these
wholesale prices on to customers is an important driver of our gross margin. We seek to protect ourselves against the risks
connected with the inherent volatility in electricity and gas prices by matching as closely as possible the quantities of
electricity which we buy at a fixed price with our commitments to supply to customers at a fixed price. However, this is not
always possible in volatile wholesale electricity and gas markets. Rising wholesale electricity and gas prices may therefore
have a temporary negative impact on our gross margin, if we are forced to buy electricity or gas in the wholesale market at a
price that is higher than the price agreed in the underlying customer supply agreement. Conversely, falling wholesale
electricity or gas prices may have a temporary positive impact on our gross margin. The supply agreements we conclude with
our customers typically allow us to pass on changes in the price levels for wholesale electricity or gas, albeit with a delay.

The wholesale electricity price is in turn affected by a wide variety of factors, including the price of underlying
commodities such as oil, natural gas and emissions allowances, availability of generating capacity on the wholesale
electricity market (and, in particular, the level of intermittent generation from sources such as wind and solar compared to
baseload generation from coal and nuclear power stations), the level of demand and wider macroeconomic conditions. Since
2014, electricity wholesale prices in the UK have trended marginally lower, principally reflecting lower gas prices, wind and
solar generation displacing coal generation (the former having no cost of fuel), increases in the amount of electricity imported
into the UK via interconnectors and electricity demand generally trending lower. However, in the second half of 2016,
wholesale electricity prices started to increase from the low reached in the first half of 2016.

**_Customers and Bad Debt_**

Our revenues and profitability are impacted by our ability to acquire new customers, retain existing customers and
minimise bad debts. We rely on various channels for the acquisition and retention of customers, including internal channels
such as renewal or change of tenancy and external channels such as direct marketing and TPIs, although greater reliance is
placed on TPIs in the I&C sector, where we receive new customer business from more than 160 TPIs. Our historical retention
rates for our existing customers have been relatively high, reflecting high customer satisfaction, with more than 85 per cent.
of our customers deciding to stay with us between April 2015 and June 2016.

Bad debts associated with failure of customers to pay their energy bills represent one of our largest administrative
expenses and amounted to £17.3 million and £14.6 million in the years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, respectively. Late
payment of customer bills also imposes increased working capital requirements on us. Over 69 per cent. of invoices in the
nine-month period ended 31 December 2016 were paid by direct debit, serving to reduce the risk of late payments. We
actively monitor the credit of our customers, vary our pricing to accommodate customer credit risk profile, manage our
customer portfolio to mitigate credit concentration and devote significant resources to managing our receivables book,
including the development and continuous improvement of IT-systems to minimise billing inaccuracies which can lead to late
payments.

**_Seasonality_**

Our business is seasonal, with typically higher revenues and operating profits from October to March as seasonal
weather patterns increase end-customer demand. Demand for gas is more seasonal and dependent on weather conditions than
demand for electricity as gas is more frequently used for heating. Changes in demand and pricing caused by seasonal
fluctuations can also have an impact on our working capital, with working capital typically higher between October and
March. Fluctuations in working capital are managed through the use of cash on balance sheet and drawings under the Opus
Revolving Credit Facility. Following our acquisition by the Drax Group, we can also access the liquidity of the Drax Group.

**Significant Factors Affecting Comparability of Financial Information**

**Loss of Climate Change Levy Exemption**

Effective 1 August 2015, the CCL-exemption for the supply of renewable energy was withdrawn. Prior to that date, we
could reduce the CCL related costs and the costs associated with SS-FiT schemes, which we pass on to our customers, by


-----

importing renewable, CCL-exempt electricity and purchasing LECs. The cost of importing such renewable energy and
purchasing the required LECs was lower than the mitigated CCL- and SS-FiT costs. Our ability to mitigate the full CCLrelated costs for the energy delivered to our customers contributed significantly to our gross margin until 1 August 2015.
Following the withdrawal of the CCL-exemption for the supply of renewable electricity, our costs, in particular SS-FiT cost,
increased significantly.

**Key Performance Indicators**

Our management uses a number of key financial and non-financial performance indicators to track the performance of
our business. The principal key performance indicators we monitor are revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating
and administrative expenses, profit for the year, EBITDA, operating profit, operating profit margin and cash generated from
operations. Additionally, we monitor electricity sales (in TWh), gas sales (in TWh) and the number of meters served as nonfinancial key performance indicators.

EBITDA is not an accounting measure within the scope of IFRS. We define EBITDA as profit before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit, profit before tax or
profit for the year or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial
_Information and Other Information—Non IFRS Financial and Other Information”._

The following table sets forth certain of our key performance indicators for the financial years ended 31 March 2015
and 2016, respectively, and the nine-month periods ended 31 December 2015 and 2016, respectively.

**Description of Key Income Statement Line Items**

Set forth below is a brief description of the composition of the key line items of our consolidated income statement.


-----

**_Revenue_**

Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between Opus Group companies. Revenues
from the sale of electricity and gas are measured based upon output delivered at rates specified under contracts or at
prevailing market rates, as applicable. Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to customers is recorded after
deduction of agreed discounts, VAT and CCL. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract
exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected
to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed, is calculated based on consumption
statistics and price estimates.

**_Total cost of sales_**

Costs of sales mainly comprise the cost of power purchases. Other cost of sales include third-party costs such as grid
charges, the costs of meeting RO obligations and SS-FiT schemes as well as, until 1 August 2015, the costs of LECs required
to deliver renewable or CCL-exempt energy to customers. Grid charges reflect costs of distribution, transmission and system
balancing.

**_Operating and administrative expenses_**

Operating and administrative expenses primarily consist of staff costs (such as wages and salaries, social security costs,
other pension costs and share-based payments), contract costs (which represent commissions payable to third-parties in
respect of obtaining new customers) and the costs of bad debt. Other operating and administrative expenses comprise mainly
office and property related cost.

**_EBITDA_**

The Opus Group’s EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. See “—Key
_Performance Indicators” and “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Information–Non IFRS Financial and Other_
_Information”._

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation represents non-cash expenses of tangible assets over time.

**_Interest payable and similar charges_**

Interest payable and similar charges reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable
on our bank loans and the amortisation of related fees).

**_Interest income_**

Interest income represents income generated through the efficient use of short-term cash surpluses, for example
through investments in money market funds or bank deposits.

**_Tax_**

The total tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount payable on the taxable
profits of the relevant year (which is adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items
which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax). Deferred tax is an
accounting adjustment which reflects whether more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between
the accounting and tax rules. The tax charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on our profit before tax for the relevant
year and the movement in the deferred tax charge in that year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

(1) We define EBITDA (in respect of the Opus Group) as profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. For a reconciliation from profit for the year to
EBITDA, please see “—Key Performance Indicators”.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by £60.9 million, or 15.2 per cent., to £462.3 million for the nine-month period ended
31 December 2016 from £401.4 million for the nine-month period ended 31 December 2015. This increase is primarily a
result of 7 per cent. and 25 per cent. increases in electricity and gas sales, respectively.

_Gross profit_

Our gross profit increased by £3.6 million, or 5.0 per cent., to £76.0 million for the nine-month period ended
31 December 2016 from £72.4 million for the nine-month period ended 31 December 2015. The gross profit margin fell from
18.0 per cent. for the nine-month period ended 31 December 2016 to 16.4 per cent. for the nine-month period ended
31 December 2016. The main reason for gross profit increasing less than proportionately with revenue is the impact of the
withdrawal of the CCL-exemption for the supply of renewable energy which became effective from 1 August 2015. Prior to
that date, we could reduce the CCL-cost and the costs associated with SS-FiT-schemes by importing renewable energy and
purchasing LECs. The cost of purchasing LECs was lower than the avoided costs of CCL and SS-FiTs.

_Operating and administrative expenses_

Our operating and administrative expenses increased by £7.5 million, or 14.0 per cent., to £61.1 million for the ninemonth period ended 31 December 2016 from £53.6 million for the nine-month period ended 31 December 2015, primarily as
a result of higher staff costs reflecting an increase in the number of employees broadly in line with our growth in revenue.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA for the Opus Group decreased by £4.0 million, or 21.2 per cent., to £14.9 million for the nine-month period
ended 31 December 2016 from £18.9 million for the year nine-month period 31 December 2015 reflecting the factors
discussed above.

_Profit for the year_

Our profit for the year decreased by £3.5 million, or 25.2 per cent., to £10.4 million for the nine-month period ended
31 December 2016 from £13.9 million for the nine-month period ended 31 December 2015. This decrease primarily resulted
from lower EBITDA, which decrease was partially offset by a proportionally lower tax charge. Depreciation and net interest
charge also remained relatively stable compared to the nine-month period ended 31 December 2015.

**_Results of Operations for the Year Ended 31 March 2015 Compared to the Year Ended 31 March 2016_**

The following table shows our results of operations for the year ended 31 March 2015 compared to the year ended
31 March 2016.

Total tax charge .................................................................................................................. (7.6) (6.8)

**Profit for the year .............................................................................................................** **28.9** **25.6**

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by £48.4 million, or 9.2 per cent., to £572.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 from
£524.3 million for the year ended 31 March 2015. This increase is primarily a result of a 4 per cent. and 36 per cent. increase
in electricity and gas sales, respectively. The growth of customers continued to be in the SME supply market, which is
characterised by lower power consumption per customer, but higher gross margins, compared to the I&C market. The
positive impact of customer and meter growth was only partially offset by lower average electricity and gas prices. Retail
electricity and gas prices continued to fall in the UK during the year ended 31 March 2016 primarily as a result of lower
commodity prices.

_Gross profit_

Our gross profit increased by £9.7 million, or 10.0 per cent., to £107.1 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 from
£97.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2015. This increase was primarily due to the combined effects of the growth of
SME electricity and gas volumes and the increased contribution from the sale of renewable electricity. The overall gross
profit margin increased slightly from 18.6 per cent. for the year ended 31 March 2015 to 18.7 per cent. for the year ended
31 March 2016. This increase was partially offset by the decreased contribution to gross profit from the CCL- and SSFiTarbitrage realised through the import of CCL-exempted renewable energy and the purchase of associated LECs for the year
ended 31 March 2015 compared to the year ended 31 March 2016, following the withdrawal of the CCL-exemption for the
supply of renewable energy effective from 1 August 2015.

_Operating and administrative expenses_

Our operating and administrative expenses increased by £13.5 million, or 22.5 per cent., to £73.4 million for the year
ended 31 March 2016 from £59.9 million for the year ended 31 March 2015, mainly due to higher contract costs, costs of bad
debt and staff costs. Contracts costs, i.e. commissions payable to TPIs, increased as a result of our customer growth and a
higher proportion of three-year contracts, for which TPIs typically earn a higher commission. The costs of bad debt increased
by £2.7 million, or 18.5 per cent., to £17.3 million in the year ended 31 March 2016 from £14.6 million in the year ended
31 March 2015 mainly due to the increase of revenue discussed above, the ratio of bad debt to revenue remained relatively
stable at 3.0 per cent. in the year ended 31 March 2016 compared to 2.7 per cent. in the year ended 31 March 2015. The
increase in staff costs was due to the average number of employees increasing by 21.4 per cent from 571 for the year ended
31 March 2015 to 693 for the year ended 31 March 2016.

_EBITDA_

Our EBITDA decreased by £3.8 million, or 10.1 per cent., to £33.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 from
£37.5 million for the year ended 31 March 2015 reflecting the factors discussed above.

_Profit for the year_

Our profit for the year decreased by £3.3 million, or 11.4 per cent., to £25.6 million for the year ended 31 March 2016
from £28.9 million for the year ended 31 March 2015. This decrease primarily resulted from lower EBITDA, which decrease
was partially offset by a lower tax charge. The effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2016 was 19.1 per cent.
compared to the effective tax rate of 19.9 per cent. for the year ended 31 March 2015, lower than the standard rate of UK
corporation tax due to tax deductions arising from the exercise of share options. Depreciation and net interest charge
increased slightly compared to the year ended 31 March 2015.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Historically, we have been financed through cash generated from our operations. In addition, we have the Opus
Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in December 2017, under which £11 million was drawn as of 31 December 2016.
Following the acquisition of the Opus Group by Drax, we also have access to Drax’s sources of liquidity, including,
following the completion of the Refinancing, under the New Revolving Facility. The following table summarises our cash
flow activity for the financial years ended 31 March 2015 and 2016 and the nine-month periods ended 31 December 2015
and 2016, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of
_Drax—Liquidity and Capital Resources”._

**_Cash generated from operations_**

Cash absorbed by operations was £0.4 million in the nine-month period ended 31 December 2016 compared to cash
generated from operations of £3.7 million in the nine-month ended 31 December 2015. This decrease of £4.1 million was
mainly due to lower profit for the year and a cash outflow from working capital resulting from higher receivables.

Net cash generated from operating activities was £26.7 million in the year ended 31 March 2016 compared to
£24.7 million in the year ended 31 March 2015. This increase of £2.0 million was mainly due to a decrease in working
capital, primarily due to an increase in accrued cost of sales, notably RO costs, which exceeded the increase in receivables
and prepayments.

**_Cash flows from investing activities_**

Net cash used in investing activities was £1.7 million in the nine-month period ended 31 December 2016 compared to
£3.1 million in the nine-month period ended 31 December 2015, principally reflecting the purchase of land in Northampton
as a possible car park site for £2.2 million in the year ended 31 March 2016.

Net cash used in investing activities was £3.2 million in the year ended 31 March 2016 compared to £1.1 million in the
year ended 31 March 2015, principally reflecting the same purchase of land discussed above.

**_Cash flows from financing activities_**

Net cash absorbed by financing activities of £13.9 million for the nine-month period ended 31 December 2016 (ninemonth period ended 31 December 2015: £17.3 million) mainly resulted from equity dividends paid of £25.3 million (ninemonth period ended 31 December 2015: £27.4 million), which were only partially offset by the proceeds from the issue of
new equity and drawings under the Opus Revolving Credit Facility. The proceeds from the issue of equity comprised
proceeds from the exercise of share options by our management and the proceeds from the issue of shares to our nonmanager shareholders under non-dilution rights as a result thereof.


-----

Net cash absorbed by financing activities of £26.2 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 (year ended 31 March
2015: £19.7 million) mainly resulted from equity dividends paid of £27.4 million (year ended 31 March 2015: £20.7 million),
which were only partially offset by the proceeds from the issue of new equity. The proceeds from the issue of equity
comprised proceeds from the exercise of share options by our management and the proceeds from the issue of shares to our
non-manager shareholders under non-dilution rights as a result thereof.

**_Contractual Obligations_**

As of 31 December 2016, we had borrowings and other financial liabilities of £11.0 million, all of which was borrowed
under the Opus Revolving Credit Facility.

We have a number of contractual commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future)
that are not recorded in the Opus Group Audited Financial Statements or the Opus Group Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of
electricity and gas up to three years ahead, operating leases for buildings and motor vehicles, contracts for the future purchase
of ROCs and contracts for the provision of services. The table below sets out these commitments as at 31 March 2015 and
2016, respectively. In addition, as of 31 December 2016, we also had a commitment to purchase an office building and land
in Northampton for approximately £8.9 million (net of a deposit of £0.5 million paid in May 2016).

**Total .............................................................................................................................................** **10.8** **14.2**

**Contingent Liabilities**

As at 31 December 2016, we had no contingent liabilities.

**Pensions**

We operate a defined contribution pension scheme, which provides a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual
contributions made by us and members of the scheme. We do not operate any defined benefit pension schemes. Payments to
defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered a service that entitles them to the
contributions. The pension charge for the financial year ended 31 March 2016 amounted to £0.5 million (financial year ended
31 March 2015: £0.5 million).

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk**

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk and credit risk.

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

We are exposed to the effects of volatility in our costs of supply. While we seek to hedge price risk and match as
closely as possible the quantities of electricity and gas which we buy at a fixed price with our commitments to supply to
customers at a fixed price, in volatile wholesale electricity and gas commodity markets, it is not always possible to match
these prices and volumes; variables include the weather and end-customer demand. In addition to the modelling of the
demand of our portfolio of customers, which is continually updated, we seek to protect ourselves through contractual terms


-----

with our customers and through maintenance of a pricing policy which ensures a margin for such inevitable forecasting
errors.

Of our financial instruments, only contracts under the long-term commercial agreements for the supply of electricity
and gas are exposed to commodity price risk. We apply the ‘own use exemption’ to our energy contracts, meaning that
contracts for the future supply of energy in the normal course of business are recognised in our financial statements as and
when supply is made.

**_Credit Risk_**

We are exposed to credit risk with respect to our investments of cash and cash equivalents and the debtors of our trade
and other receivables. The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within approved policies with
banks which have credit ratings that are deemed to be acceptable.

Our exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as
summarised in the following table:

**As at 31 March**


**2015**


**2016**


**(£ million)**
Cash and cash equivalents ............................................................................................................ 25.0 22.3
Trade and other receivables .......................................................................................................... 119.7 140.9

**Total .............................................................................................................................................** **144.7** **163.2**

We actively monitor the credit of our customers, vary our pricing to accommodate customer risk profiles, manage our

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements**

The Opus Group Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and the Opus Group
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS on an interim financial reporting basis
(IAS 34). In connection with the preparation of the Opus Group Audited Financial Statements and the Opus Group Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements, the directors of Opus Energy Group Limited are required to make assumptions and estimates
about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the
related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, trends and other factors that
our management believed to be relevant at the time the Opus Group Audited Financial Statements and the Opus Group
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements were prepared. On a regular basis, our management reviews the accounting policies,
assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that the Opus Group Audited Financial Statements and the Opus Group
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements are presented fairly and in accordance with IFRS. However, because future events
and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and
such differences could be material.

Our management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management’s most difficult, subjective or
complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.

**_Revenue and Cost of Sales_**

Revenue derived from the supply of energy includes an estimate of the value of energy supplied to customers between
the date of the last meter reading and the end of the reporting period. Estimates of the number of units consumed but not yet
processed through the settlement process are based on an estimate of the expected annual consumption for that customer to
the period end until final reconciliation data are received.

Similarly, purchase volumes are also subject to the same degree of estimation, with associated settlement costs
dependent on the receipt of final reconciliation data from the relevant industry body.

**_Financial Instruments_**

We have long-term commercial agreements for the supply of electricity and gas. The ‘own use exemption’ has been
applied and so these contracts have not been measured as financial instruments. Our management believes that the ‘own use
exemption’ is available because the contracts are held for the purpose of the delivery of a non-financial item (energy) in
accordance with our own expected purchase and sale requirements, but there is an element of judgment involved.

**_Impairment of Trade Debtors_**

Trade debtors are stated net of the allowance for the impairment of bad and doubtful debts. The allowance is calculated
by applying historical collection rates to balances outstanding as at the year-end date, with the amount of any loss recognised
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income under administrative expenses.

**_Accounting for Renewables Obligation_**

The carrying amount of ROCs in our balance sheet is dependent upon their purpose. ROCs that are purchased for the
purpose of being utilised in the settlement of our own renewable obligation are held at cost and are classified under
prepayments. ROCs held for resale are valued at the estimated selling price. Our accrual for the cost of the Renewable
Obligation is based upon the estimated value of a ROC.

**_Share-based payments_**

The fair value of the shares and options is obtained using an option pricing model. Assumptions include expected
volatility, expected life, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.

**The UK electricity industry**

The principal sectors of the UK electricity industry are:

    - Generation: the production of electricity;

    - Transmission and distribution: the transfer of electricity across the high-voltage electricity transmission network
(the “Transmission System”) and the delivery of electricity from the Transmission System through low voltage
local distribution networks to customers (the “Distribution System”);

    - Wholesale: the buying and selling of wholesale electricity by traders, generators, suppliers and other wholesale
market participants; and

    - Supply: the supply of electricity by licensed suppliers to customers.

**Overview of the generation sector**

In 2015, approximately 50 per cent. of the electricity produced in the UK was generated by power stations which
produce heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas. Nuclear power stations, by contrast, capture the heat
released from splitting atoms. In each case, the heat created is used to turn water into steam (in a boiler), which then turns a
turbine that drives an electrical generator. Electricity is also generated from renewable energy sources, such as burning
biomass, and from water, solar and wind. Incineration of household and industrial waste and burning gases emitted from
landfill sites are also used to generate electricity. The diversity of electricity generation is a key contributor to security of
supply.

_Coal and oil-fired power stations_

Until 1996, coal and oil-fired power stations represented the largest proportion of electricity generation capacity in the
UK. Since then, the trend in generation has been the continuing growth of gas-fired and renewable generation and the
displacement of coal and oil-fired generation, with a reduction of coal-fired capacity of 45 per cent. since 2008.

In November 2015, the Government announced its intention to phase out electricity generation from coal by 2025 in
order to reduce overall carbon dioxide emissions, and has stated that the capacity loss from the closure of coal plants by 2025
should be replaced by less carbon intensive energy sources, such as gas capacity. In 2015 and 2016, coal plants with an
aggregate capacity of 8GW were closed in the UK.

_Nuclear power stations_

Nuclear power stations in the UK are designed to operate for sustained periods of time at relatively constant output
levels and are not well suited to varying output quickly. Their low variable (as opposed to fixed) costs also mean that they
have a commercial incentive to generate as much electricity as possible, and therefore continue to generate electricity during
periods when market prices are low.

_Gas-fired stations_

There are two primary types of gas-fired station: combined cycle gas turbine stations (“CCGT”) and open cycle gas
turbine stations (“OCGT”). In a CCGT power station, the hot gases created by natural gas combustion are used first to drive
the turbine generator and then used in a boiler to produce steam to drive a second turbine generator, producing additional
power from the same fuel. CCGT stations are generally fuelled by gas alone, although some stations have the capability to
burn gas-oil. Since 1990, CCGT power stations have provided the vast majority of new thermal generating capacity in the
UK.

In an OCGT station, the hot exhaust gases, typically created by gas-oil combustion, are used to drive the turbine and
then expelled into the atmosphere.


-----

Modern OCGT and CCGT plants in the UK are generally capable of varying output upon shorter notice than existing
coal-fired units, hence more responsive to short-term demand changes.

_Renewables: biomass_

Biomass is biological material obtained from living, or recently living, organic matter (such as plants and trees) that
can be converted into electricity, fuel and heat. Biomass generation is considered a supply of renewable energy because
sourced and burnt biomass can be replaced through re-plantings and the carbon dioxide that is emitted from burning the
harvested biomass can be absorbed by the new plant growth through the process of photosynthesis. When biomass is sourced
sustainably, the conversion of coal-firing power stations to burning biomass, or co-firing biomass with fossil fuels, can offer
a relatively quick, cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation in the short to medium term.

There are a variety of sources of biomass, from forestry residues (branches, tops and other low-grade wood) to
dedicated energy crops. Biomass is the fourth largest fuel source in the world after oil, coal and gas.

One of the types of sustainable biomass feedstock comes in the form of pellets produced from thinnings, branches, tops
and other low-grade wood fibre, together with sawmill chips and sawdust. Co-firing and converted coal plants usually require
high-grade ‘clean’ wood pellets, with a high energy density to enhance plant efficiency.

A generator’s technical specification for industrial wood pellets is influenced by the combustion technology (the design
of boiler, burners and other equipment) and the logistics facilities (transport off/on-site and storage capacity) associated with
the plant where it is intended to be used. The combustion technology determines the limitations of tolerable chemical
composition and the logistics facilities influence the physical quality requirements.

Biomass is the only low carbon technology capable of providing flexible, reliable electricity and system support
services, which gives it an advantage over intermittent forms of renewable electricity generation.

_Other renewables_

Apart from biomass, electricity is generated in the UK from other renewable energy sources including wind (both
onshore and offshore), solar power, hydro-electric power, bioenergy (including landfill gas, sewage sludge digestion, heat
pumps and deep geothermal energy) and energy from waste combustion (both household and industrial). Some of these
energy sources, in particular wind and solar, generate electricity only on an intermittent basis.

_Contribution to generation by fuel type_

According to DBEIS’s provisional figures for 2016, coal and generation from gas represented approximately 9 per
cent. and 42 per cent. of the electricity generated in the UK, respectively. In the corresponding period, generation from
nuclear fuel and renewable sources contributed approximately 21 per cent. and 25 per cent. of electricity generation,
respectively. Renewable sources consist of wind and solar (14 per cent.), bioenergy (9 per cent., including biomass) and other
renewables (2 per cent.).

**Transmission and distribution sector**

_Overview of the transmission and distribution sector_

The Transmission System carries electricity long distances around the UK at high voltages. It includes the overhead
lines, underground cables and substations which connect the large generation assets and interconnectors to the distribution
system. The System Operator owns and operates the Transmission System in Great Britain and, as system operator,
coordinates and directs electricity flows on to and over the Transmission System, balancing generation supply and user
demand.

The Distribution System carries a lower voltage than the Transmission System through networks of overhead lines,
underground cables and substations. The Distribution System takes over the role of transporting electricity from the
Transmission System and delivers it to customers at a voltage they can use. Whereas large electricity producers are connected
directly to the national Transmission System, smaller-scale power stations can be connected directly to the Distribution
System on a regional basis. These smaller-scale power stations currently receive various financial benefits (“embedded
benefits”) as a result of their direct connection to the Distribution System. However, following a recent consultation, Ofgem
has stated that it is likely to reduce the level of embedded benefits received by such power stations in order to prevent market
distortion and protect customers. A final decision is expected in May 2017.

The Transmission System is linked by interconnectors to the Transmission Systems of France, the Netherlands,
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, through which an additional 4GW of capacity is available. European legislation
requires nearly all interconnection capacity, with some exemptions for long-term interconnection contracts, to be allocated to
the wholesale market by way of auction.

In May 2014, the Government introduced the “Cap and Floor” regulatory regime to encourage investment in electricity
interconnectors. Interconnectors developed under this regime will earn revenue from the allocation of capacity to users who
want to flow electricity between the UK and its neighbouring countries. In the scenario where an interconnector does not earn
sufficient revenue from its operation, the gap between its revenue and the floor level will be transferred from the System
Operator, which will recover cost through the transmission charges to users of the Great Britain electricity Transmission
System. Alternatively, should the interconnector earn in excess of the cap, the surplus will be transferred back to the System
Operator.

The pilot Cap and Floor project, Nemo Link, is expected to become operational in 2019. In 2015 applications for five
interconnector investment projects were successfully awarded under the Cap and Floor regime, and these projects are
expected to become operational between 2020 and 2022.

_Ancillary Services_

Due to the growing dependency on intermittent renewable energy, Ancillary Services contracts are offered to electricity
generators. This provides system support to the System Operator as it maintains a reliable system through the procurement of
balancing, frequency response and reactive power. As more conventional power stations reach the end of their useful lives,
there are fewer market participants capable of providing Ancillary Services.

The total cost of delivering Ancillary Services is included within the balancing services Use of System (“BSUoS”),
splitting into internal costs and external costs, charged to generators and/or customers for Ancillary Services.

**Wholesale**

_Overview of the wholesale electricity market_

The wholesale market consists of electricity generators producing electricity and selling their output to electricity
suppliers who in turn on-sell electricity to customers. Market participants tend to be either focused on the sale of electricity
from generation or the purchase of electricity for supply; however, certain market participants have an interest in both.
Wholesale trades are entered via a number of venues, including bilaterally, through brokered platforms or on exchanges.
Wholesale trades involve various time frames, from contracts for several years ahead to same-day trading markets and fixed
periods (for example, specified half-hours or seasons).

The wholesale electricity market trades across three sub-markets:

    - the long-term forward market, allowing contracts to be struck up to several years ahead of delivery in response to
market participants’ requirements;

    - the short-term bilateral market, operated through power exchanges which gives market participants the opportunity
to fine tune their contractual positions; and

    - the real-time market, through which the System Operator accepts offers and bids for electricity to enable it to
balance supply and demand on the system.

Electricity cannot be easily stored in large volumes and so, in order to ensure a secure supply of electricity to end users,
the volume of generated electricity must match the volume being consumed. The System Operator matches, on a real-time
basis, the generation and consumption of electricity in Great Britain to ensure the stability of the electricity system and
maintenance of satisfactory voltage and frequency. Where necessary, the System Operator pays sources of generation or
consumption in order to increase or decrease their generation or consumption.

Electricity is traded in 30-minute blocks and each generator and supplier (except for certain smaller market
participants) has metering that measures, or estimates, its total generation or aggregate consumption in each 30-minute block.
Generators and suppliers (together with other entities) trade voluntarily with each other until the hour before the start of a 30minute block (a point in time referred to as “gate closure”). At gate closure, ideally the volume of electricity that generators
have contracted to generate and that suppliers have contracted to consume should be equal, resulting in a balanced electricity
system. After gate closure, it is the System Operator’s responsibility to ensure that the electricity system is balanced.

Generators and suppliers of electricity are incentivised to contract accurately for the volume of electricity they intend to
generate or consume in any 30-minute block. Any imbalance in volume between generators and suppliers results in an
“imbalance charge” on the difference between the contractual volume and the metered volume in that 30-minute block. This
imbalance charge is generally at a less favourable (and less certain) price than the wholesale market price for that particular
30-minute block, which further incentivises generators and suppliers to contract as accurately as possible. Imbalance charges
are intended to reflect the costs incurred by the System Operator on behalf of the electricity industry when it has to increase
or reduce electricity generation or consumption in order to balance the electricity system.

_Wholesale prices_

The market price for wholesale electricity is affected by a number of factors, including the prices of underlying
commodities such as oil, natural gas, coal, biomass and emission allowances; availability of generating capacity on the
electricity system; the physical positions taken by individual market participants; and wider economic conditions.

A power station needs to achieve enough revenue per MWh to cover its variable costs, including fuel, carbon and some
variable operation and maintenance costs, to be economically viable to operate in the short run. Electricity prices are set by
the intersection of demand and supply, which is demonstrated by the “merit order” principle. The merit order describes the
short-run marginal cost of available electricity generation in ascending order for a particular market, against the
corresponding amount of energy that will be generated.

Power stations available to generate can be modelled, according to their different costs of generation, as a stack, which
is overlaid with forecast demand for electricity. The available power stations are drawn on to supply electricity to fulfil this
demand, starting with the power stations that have the lowest cost of generation. At the point in the demand stack where
forecast demand intersects with available supply, the power station supplying electricity at the point of intersection is known
as the “marginal plant”. The marginal price at which the marginal plant is willing to generate therefore dictates the prevailing
market price.

The fuel type of the marginal plant is the fundamental driver of the market price. A power station’s cost of generation
is determined largely by the cost of the type of fuel used, which cost can be susceptible to market forces and can fluctuate
widely. Some power stations have negative costs of generation, such as those which use wind or solar, since the subsidies
provided to renewable generators are greater than their minimal cost of generation.


-----

A power station’s cost of generation is also affected by its efficiency. Among power stations that depend on the same
source of fuel, the range of efficiencies fluctuates depending on each power station’s technology and level of underlying
investment. The cost of generation can therefore vary significantly between plants, despite the same type of fuel being used.

In the illustrative example of a demand stack below for Summer 2017 if demand were forecast as 45GW, a coal-fired
power station would be the marginal plant and would set the market price. If, however, demand were forecast between 17GW
and 41GW, a CCGT power station would be the marginal plant and would set the market price.

**Demand versus Capacity**

The price for generated electricity can therefore fluctuate in line with the merit order, reflecting different efficiencies,
fuel costs and renewable capacity available in the market.

**Supply**

Total electricity demand in the UK is approximately 300TWh each year, with approximately one third relating to
domestic demand and two thirds to non-domestic demand. As of January 2016, the market comprised approximately
27.5 million domestic customers and approximately 2.7 million business customers.

In the domestic market, contracts for electricity supply are often combined with domestic gas supply in dual fuel
contracts. The types of these contracts are varied but tend to be simple rolling tariff or fixed term contracts, often with an
automatic roll-over into an open-ended, variable price contract at the end of the fixed term.

The non-domestic market can broadly be divided into two sub-sectors: the SME sector comprising smaller companies
and micro-enterprises; and the I&C sector. Contract types and pricing structures vary greatly, particularly in the larger I&C
market, where contracts may be bespoke.

**Retail Market Share of Consumption by Market**

Source: Cornwall Energy, October 2015


-----

As of October 2015, there were approximately 1.8 million SME electricity meters and approximately 0.9 million I&C
electricity meters, with 37TWh and 151TWh electricity consumption respectively. Compared to the I&C segment, the SME
market has a lower energy consumption per meter and higher gross margins per MWh.

Customers may require that all, or a defined proportion, of the electricity for which they contract is generated from
renewable sources. The fungible nature of electricity makes it impossible to trace a particular volume of electricity back to its
source of generation, so instead the provenance of the renewable electricity is demonstrated by the supplier acquiring various
renewables certificates. The extra cost of renewable electricity is ordinarily passed through to the customer as part of the
contract (whether expressly stated or otherwise) and so electricity sold pursuant to these products tends to be more costly
than the corresponding volumes of non-renewable electricity. The extra cost of renewable electricity, however, is also
mitigated, and often offset, by various exemptions from charges applied to non-renewable electricity.

**The Big Six**

The UK electricity market was privatised in 1990, introducing competition among those companies that succeeded the
nationalised Electricity Boards into both the generation and, to a limited extent, supply markets. Competition in the supply
market increased in stages until it was fully developed by 1999, at which point no geographical franchises remained.

Following a period of consolidation among suppliers and generators and, in many cases, subsequent acquisition by
large overseas utilities groups, the wholesale market is now dominated by the “Big Six” vertically-integrated energy
companies which have a large market share in both generation and supply: British Gas (owned by Centrica), EDF Energy,
E.ON (which recently demerged to E.ON and Uniper), npower (owned by Innogy SE), SSE and Scottish Power (owned by
Iberdrola). As of 2015, the Big Six together supplied energy to approximately 85 per cent. of domestic customers in the UK
and generated approximately 70 per cent. of total electricity generation. In 2015, Drax generated a higher share of wholesale
(i.e. electricity that is not embedded in the distribution grid, such as residential solar panels) electricity than E.ON, SSE and
Scottish Power within the Big Six.

**Wholesale electricity generation market share by company in 2015**

Over recent years, the Big Six have lost market share in the non-domestic segment to other energy generators and
stand-alone suppliers, including to Drax through Haven Power and the Opus Group. As of October 2015, the Big Six held a
73.2 per cent. market share in the non-domestic segment compared to 82.4 per cent. in October 2012.

**Electricity market: regulatory context**

_Capacity constraints_

The UK electricity market, which had approximately 73.7GW of electricity generation capacity in the winter of
2016/2017, faces a challenging period of significant structural change. As additional intermittent renewable generation
capacity is commissioned, the market share of such capacity is expected to increase while, at the same time, a substantial
proportion of conventional electricity generation comes offline. While some retirements are attributable to the end of
operating life, in the case of coal, the prohibitive costs of complying with emissions targets and other environmental
regulations have reduced their economic viability. The feasibility of projects has been further affected by the low wholesale
price environment that has been experienced in the energy market since 2014. The constraints imposed on the Transmission
System by this structural change are evidenced by the System Operator’s recent issuance of Notifications of Inadequate
System Margin as the supply/demand balance increasingly tightens in the UK electricity market.


-----

Due to Government initiatives implemented in an effort to meet EU regulation and recent international developments
(such as during the COP-21 conference in 2015), a significant share of the UK’s CO2 intensive generation capacity is
expected to be taken offline, as the UK’s power stations age and as EU environmental legislation, notably the Industrial
Emissions Directive (“IED”), impose stricter standards. This primarily relates to coal-fired and oil-fired plants which may
not be able to comply with new regulation in respect of CO2 emissions in certain circumstances. The IED was enacted to
reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and dust from large combustion plants. A number of coal-fired and
oil-fired plants that did not comply with the IED’s predecessor, the Large Combustion Plant Directive, were required to close
by the end of 2015, driving the need for new generation plants to be commissioned in order to maintain the UK’s security of
electricity supply.

DBEIS forecasts that approximately 4GW of existing nuclear power will be taken out of production by 2020. DBEIS
projections also suggest an increase in generation capacity of 32GW from all technologies by 2035 compared to 2017
including an increase in nuclear generation capacity of 8GW.

The UK is currently in the process of developing a new range of nuclear power stations with the decision on Hinkley
Point C approving what will be the first nuclear power station built in the UK since 1995. Hinkley Point C will have capacity
of 3.2GW, with total expected costs of approximately £18 billion with a secured CfD strike price of £92.5/MWh (as of 2012,
subject to adjustment for consumer price inflation) for a term of 35 years following the commissioning of each generation
unit. Furthermore, Wylfa in Wales and Moorside in Cumbria are also being considered as sites for new nuclear
developments.

_Global and European context for renewable energy_

The global and national markets for renewable energy are policy-driven markets resulting from initiatives designed to
generate economic incentives for the reduction of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, thereby mitigating the onset of
climate change and helping to improve security of energy supply.

At an international level, the regulation of GHG, including CO2, is directed by the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (the “UNFCCC”) and the Kyoto Protocol to that Convention (the “Kyoto **Protocol”). The**
Kyoto Protocol came into force in 2005, and provides an international framework for the reduction of GHG emissions,
legally committing the ratifying countries to making these reductions.

The UK is a party to the UNFCCC and has signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol as part of the EU commitment for
the reduction of GHG emissions. The first commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol ended in 2012. A second commitment
period was agreed at the Doha Conference in December 2012 (the “Doha **Amendment”) and runs from 1 January 2013 to**
31 December 2020. In 2015, the UNFCCC’s 195 member countries signed the Paris Agreement at the COP-21 conference,
which committed them to the target of holding the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, which effectively committed the world to
becoming carbon-neutral after 2050.

_European clean energy legislative framework_

In 2008, following the international commitments made under the Kyoto Protocol, the Commission presented the
second Strategic Energy Review package, a set of energy and climate change measures for the EU known as the “20-20-20”
initiative, aimed at achieving a 20 per cent. reduction in GHG emissions, a 20 per cent. share for renewables in final energy
consumption, and a 20 per cent. reduction in future energy demand by 2020.

One of the main pieces of legislation supporting renewable generation at the EU level is the Renewable Energy
Directive (2009/28) (the “Renewable Energy Directive”). Under the Renewable Energy Directive, EU Member States are
required to adopt national targets for renewables that are consistent with reaching the European Commission’s overall EU
target of a 20 per cent. share of energy from renewable sources relative to final energy consumption from all sources by 2020.

_The push towards renewable energy_

According to DBEIS, the increase in the UK lower carbon technologies will be largely driven by the capacity growth in
wind, solar, nuclear and gas. To meet the UK’s target of 15 per cent. primary consumption from renewable sources, without
compromising the security of supply in the system, the UK power system may become increasingly reliant upon the
construction of new CCGTs and OCGTs, expand in non-intermittent renewable energy (e.g. biomass) and depend on
increased imports of power through interconnectors.

The desire to address climate change, along with supply pressures, has led to a number of regulatory and market
initiatives in the UK. In particular, successive Governments have been supportive of the growth of renewable energy, as
demonstrated by the legislation passed and policies issued in recent years.


-----

_The EU Emissions Trading System_

In 2005, the EU ETS, a cap-and-trade scheme for EU Allowances (“EUAs”) was introduced. The system operates by
placing a cap on the total CO2 emissions from industrial sectors and energy-intensive industries which are covered by the
scheme. At the end of each phase of the scheme, each installation needs to submit a number of EUAs, equal to its CO2
emissions in the period. The scheme is now in its third phase, which runs from 2013 to 2020 (Phase One ran from 2005 to
2007, and Phase Two ran from 2008 to 2012).

The fourth phase, which runs from 2021 to 2030, is currently under review on the basis of the European Commission’s
legislative proposal presented in July 2015. The revision suggests a more aggressive pace of emission cuts, declining the total
emission allowances at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent. compared to 1.7 per cent. currently. Additionally, it is proposed to
better target carbon leakage rules and encourage low-carbon innovation and modernisation of the energy sector.

The largest sector covered by the EU ETS is the electricity sector. The marginal cost of a generator with high CO2
emissions (typically fossil fuel generators) is therefore increased by the cost of purchasing EUAs to cover the amount of
carbon emissions over each compliance period. As such, while non-renewable generation is the price-setter, the value of
emissions is reflected in the price of wholesale electricity, as adjusted for the carbon intensity of that form of electricity
generation. The wholesale electricity price is therefore generally considered to include the cost of carbon emissions, in
addition to fuel and other costs incurred by the generator.

The ability to trade excess emission allowances is an incentive to companies to reduce overall emissions by investing in
more efficient technology or shifting to less carbon-intensive energy sources, in return for receiving additional revenue.
Consequently, the carbon price fluctuates based on the supply and demand of emission allowances. Historically, in depressed
economic conditions, the market was oversupplied with unused emission allowances, trading at a significantly lower price,
and thereby minimising any disincentive for the energy market to generate electricity from more carbon-intensive coal-fired
plants.

**UK clean energy legislation**

The Renewable Energy Directive sets a target for the UK of 15 per cent. for primary energy consumption from
renewables by 2020. The Government released a Renewable Energy Roadmap (last updated in November 2013) designed to
achieve that objective. It follows on from the Renewable Energy Strategy issued in June 2009, the UK’s National
Renewables Energy Action Plan submitted to the European Commission in July 2010 and the original Renewable Energy
Roadmap published in July 2011. The 2011 Roadmap highlighted eight technologies which the Government expects to
provide over 90 per cent. of the UK’s 2020 15 per cent. renewable energy target. These technologies include onshore and
offshore wind, biomass electricity, biomass heat, marine (wave and tidal), ground source heat pumps, air source heat pumps
and renewable transport.

A large proportion of renewable generation is intermittent in nature and, accordingly, the Government estimates that
approximately 30 per cent. of the UK’s electricity capacity will need to come from renewable sources by 2020 in order to
ensure that the 15 per cent. overall renewable energy target is met. As such, the Government has introduced incentive and
support schemes to help achieve that target.

In October 2014, the European Council agreed on a new 2030 framework for climate change and energy, including
EU-wide targets and policy objectives for the period between 2020 and 2030. This framework sets an EU-wide target of
27 per cent. for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030. This target is binding at the EU level but has not
yet been translated into specific national targets. As in many sectors, it is very difficult to predict the impact of Brexit on
energy regulation.

_Renewable energy supplier schemes in the UK_

To incentivise the move to electricity generation from renewables, the UK has introduced a number of support
measures, principally:

(i) the Climate Change Act 2008 (“CCA”);

(ii) the RO Scheme;

(iii) the Carbon Price Floor;

(iv) the CfD Regime, including Investment Contracts; and

(v) the Small-Scale Feed-in Tariffs (“SS-FiT”) scheme.

Both the Carbon Price Floor and the CfD Regime were measures introduced under the wider proposals for Electricity
Market Reform discussed below.


-----

_The Climate Change Act 2008_

The CCA was introduced to establish a framework to develop an economically credible emissions reduction path. The
CCA commits the UK to an 80 per cent. reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 1990 levels. The CCA also
established the Committee on Climate Change (“CCC”) which advises the Government and devolved administrations on
progress towards this target. The CCA requires the Government to set legally binding carbon budgets (a cap on the amount of
GHG emitted in the UK over a five-year period). These budgets are established to serve as a pathway to the final legally
binding target for 2050, to reduce emissions by at least 80 per cent. compared to 1990 levels. In June 2016, the Government
has committed to CCC’s fifth carbon budget to reduce UK GHG emissions in 2030 by 57 per cent. relative to 1990 levels.

The CCC’s advice to the Government on carbon budgets and targets is presented to Parliament by the Government with
the ultimate aim of enacting the advice into law.

The international, supranational and national commitments described above are enshrined in law and underpin the
UK’s efforts to mitigate climate change through the deployment of renewable energy. To facilitate investment in renewable
energy and hence meet these legal commitments, the Government has developed support regimes which sit within and
alongside the UK power market.

_The Renewables Obligation_

The RO Scheme is a market-based mechanism which has been the main source of financial support from the
Government to large-scale renewable electricity generation in the UK since 2002. The powers required to establish the RO
were included in the Utilities Act 2000, and the detailed mechanics are defined in Renewables Obligation Orders, which are
implemented periodically and the most recent of which came into force on 1 April 2014.

As a result of the proposed transition to the CfD Regime under the Electricity Market Reform, the Renewables
Obligation Closure Order came into force on 9 September 2014, which has closed the RO to new generation capacity that
seeks to be accredited on or after 1 April 2017. As of 1 April 2017, existing projects already accredited under the RO Scheme
are expected to remain under the RO Scheme for the remainder of their period of support until 2027 (unless they move onto
the CfD Regime instead). See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry—The reduction or
_abandonment of governmental support for generation of electricity from biomass or other relevant changes in governmental_
_energy policy may materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.”_

_Operation of the Renewables Obligation_

The RO operates in England and Wales, with parallel obligations in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The RO places an
obligation on licensed electricity suppliers to either source a proportion of the electricity they provide to customers from
eligible renewable sources or to make a buy-out payment. The sourcing of renewable energy is demonstrated by the supplier
presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to the administrator of the RO Scheme,
Ofgem.

ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh of renewable electricity generated in different
proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity suppliers can source ROCs from renewable electricity
generators. ROCs are tradable commodities that have no fixed price and therefore the amount an electricity supplier pays for
a ROC is a matter for negotiation between the supplier and generator.

If a supplier fails to purchase sufficient ROCs to fulfil its obligation to source renewable electricity, then it must make
a buy-out payment for each of the ROCs it should otherwise have submitted. Buy-out payments are in turn recycled back to
the suppliers in proportion to the amount of ROCs submitted by those suppliers. As such, the price of ROCs is inversely
related to the amount of renewable energy produced: the greater the shortfall below the target, the greater the buy-out
payments to those who did submit ROCs.

DBEIS sets the level of the obligation to source renewable electricity each year using a headroom calculation. The
headroom calculation provides a set margin between the predicted generation (supply of ROCs) and the level of the
obligation (demand for ROCs). This helps reduce the possibility of supply exceeding the obligation in any given year and
therefore the market value of a ROC being diminished. See “Risk Factors Relating to The Business-Fluctuations in the
_demand for and supply of ROCs could result in the revenues we receive from the sale of ROCs to third-party suppliers being_
_substantially lower than anticipated”._

The RO provides for the price of buy-out payments to increase with the retail price index each year, beginning at
£30/MWh in 2002 and now at £45.58/MWh for the compliance period ending in March 2018.

Each RO compliance period begins on 1 April and lasts one year. Suppliers must comply with their obligation by
submitting ROCs for that compliance period (or ROCs for the immediately preceding compliance period that were not
previously submitted) by the September following the end of the compliance period. Ofgem then collects all the buy-out
payments and makes the payment to suppliers approximately one month later.


-----

There is a delay of approximately three months between the generation of a unit of renewable electricity and the
accreditation of the associated ROC in Ofgem’s Renewables and Combined Heat and Power Register. After this accreditation
the ROC can be traded.

From the generator’s perspective, the revenue received for each unit of electricity sold under the RO is comprised of
three main elements, which together constitute the RO all-in price. Each of these three elements has an independent value and
can be sold separately. The three elements are:

    - the revenue realised in the wholesale electricity market: the market price of electricity generated;

    - the revenue realised for selling the ROC: a fixed amount paid by a supplier for the ROC in question (traditionally a
percentage of the buy-out payment avoided by the supplier as a result of having acquired the ROC instead); and

    - the revenue realised from recycling: a share of the buy-out fund which is recycled back to suppliers and then
typically passed on to generators under the terms of the sale of ROCs.

The price realised for each of these elements must be bilaterally negotiated between the relevant generator and its
counterparty, or counterparties, in the market. Historically the price of ROCs has been similar to, and followed the price of,
buy-out payments.

_Grandfathering of support under the Renewables Obligation_

A banding system was introduced to regulate the RO in April 2009. This system provides that the numbers of ROCs
received by a generator per MWh of electricity produced differs depending on the type of renewable generation technology
deployed, the principle being that less developed technologies should receive a greater number of ROCs to encourage their
development. However, to mitigate the disturbance that could arise from banding (and changing ROC awards for projects
already in operation or under construction), the banding levels for most technologies are grandfathered. Grandfathering is a
Government policy that allows, once a generating station is accredited and receiving support under the RO, the level of
support received to remain unchanged for the lifetime of its support. Grandfathering gives generators sufficient certainty of
income to make investment in new renewable generation capacity.

The latest comprehensive banding review occurred in 2012 and provided a level of 1.0 ROC for every MWh of
renewable generation from converted biomass units and 0.9 ROC for every MWh of renewable generation from high-range,
or enhanced, co-firing units. Enhanced co-firing units are defined as units co-firing at least 85 per cent. biomass and fossil
fuels such as coal. In April 2013, grandfathering was extended to the biomass conversion and mid-range co-firing bands and
also to the high-range co-firing band in April 2014. For these bands, grandfathering operates so that, once the generating
station has been accredited under the RO, grandfathering applies to the level of support at the date that the combustion unit
moves into the mid-range, high-range or biomass conversion band. Grandfathering then applies for so long as the combustion
unit stays in that band and ceases to apply as soon as the combustion unit moves into another band. A combustion unit is
treated as moving into a new band from the moment it starts generating electricity in respect of which ROCs under that new
band are issued. However, since 12 December 2014, new biomass conversion units and combustion units already receiving
support under the RO Scheme that move for the first time into the mid-range co-firing, high-range co-firing or biomass
conversion bands, will no longer be covered by the Government’s grandfathering policy.

The Government can issue a public consultation to implement an emergency review of the banding levels at any time.
A banding review for biomass co-firing or conversion could be carried out if certain conditions were met; for example, if the
Government were satisfied that the costs had fallen significantly.

_The Renewables Obligation after 2017_

The RO closed to newly accredited renewable generation on 1 April 2017, following which generators are not able to
apply for support under the RO in respect of any new renewable generation (subject to certain grace periods for certain
projects and earlier closure dates for certain projects). All renewable generation plants which have been accredited before this
time are able to continue to receive ROCs based on their grandfathered bands (if grandfathered) and the headroom principle
continues to apply.

From 1 April 2027 to 31 March 2037, the current buy-out fund system is no longer intended to be in effect, and all
accredited projects that are still receiving ROCs at that time (for many projects, these are scheduled to end in 2027) will
simply receive a fixed payment of 110 per cent. of the buy-out price for their ROCs from a central body. This procedure is
still being finalised. The 2027 buy-out price will be fixed at this point but will continue to be indexed to the retail price index
throughout the remaining 10 years of the RO.

_Climate Change Levy_

The Climate Change Levy (“CCL”) is a tax on energy (electricity, gas, solid fuels) being supplied to non-domestic
customers in the UK, introduced in 2001. Non-domestic customers—to which the CCL applies—are in the following sectors:


-----

industry, commerce, agriculture or public services. The objective of the CCL is to create an incentive for efficiency in energy
usage and reduce CO2 emissions. In its initial form, the CCL exempted electricity generated from renewable and approved
combined heat and power schemes. This exemption was, however, removed from the regime in 2015. Until 1 August 2015,
generators of renewable source electricity received from Ofgem a specific number of levy exemption certificates (the
“LECs”) per MWh of renewable source electricity produced. Renewable energy generators could sell their LECs to
electricity suppliers who presented these to HM Revenue & Customs as proof that the electricity they supplied is CCLexempt.

_Carbon Price Floor_

The Carbon Price Floor was designed to incentivise investment in low-carbon electricity generation by providing
greater support and certainty to the carbon price in the UK’s electricity generation sector. It was introduced in response to
fluctuations in the price of carbon (in the form of EU ETS allowances) which resulted in uncertainty for investors in lowcarbon technologies. With effect from April 2013, the UK implemented a system of Carbon Price Support which is intended
to give investors long-term visibility of a rising carbon price in the UK, which will be reflected in the future price of UK
electricity.

The Carbon Price Support had an original starting level of £4.94/tonne of CO2 for 2013/14. It was originally expected
that the Carbon Price Support level would rise to £30/tonne of CO2 by 2020; however, it is currently capped at £18/tonne of
CO2 until 2020/2021. The Government is expected to review the position for 2021/2022 and provide further details for carbon
prices for the period 2022 to 2030 in the 2017 Autumn Statement.

_Small-Scale Feed-in Tariffs_

The SS-FiT scheme is a Government programme designed to promote the uptake of a range of small-scale renewable
and low-carbon electricity generation technologies and is available through licensed electricity suppliers. The SS-FiT scheme
requires tariff payments on both generation and supply of renewable and low-carbon electricity to be made by certain
suppliers. Tariff payment rates are index-linked and therefore increase or decrease with inflation.

**Overview of Electricity Market Reform**

The Electricity Market Reform package was announced in 2010 and is being steadily implemented over time.
Electricity Market Reform was designed to decarbonise electricity generation in the UK, secure the UK’s energy supply in a
capacity-constrained market place and minimise the cost of electricity to customers.

The four main components of the Electricity Market Reform package are:

    - the Carbon Price Support: this measure is already implemented (see “UK clean energy legislation—Carbon Price
_Floor”);_

    - CfDs: long-term contracts to support investment in new renewable energy projects;

    - the Capacity Market: this involves the award of capacity market agreements to generators which receive payments
in return for committing to generate at times of system stress; it also aims to encourage investment in demand-side
response capacity; and

    - the Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”): this will cap the amount of carbon emissions that a new fossil fuel
generation plant can emit.

The budget for low-carbon electricity investment across the various support schemes is currently controlled by the
Government’s framework for managing costs, the Levy Control Framework (running at £2.35 billion per annum and with an
increase to £7.6 billion per annum (in 2012 prices) by 2020). This effectively imposes a cap (managed by HM Treasury and
subject to an acceptable overshoot of 20 per cent.) on the amount of DBEIS’ energy schemes funded through levies on
electricity suppliers and ultimately paid for through customers’ energy bills. DBEIS is therefore able to reallocate its
expenditure between different support regimes (for example, from the RO Scheme to the CfD Regime), provided that the
total expenditure remains within the parameters set out in the Levy Control Framework. The Government in its Spring
Budget 2017 has stated that the Levy Control Framework will be replaced by a new set of controls, which it expects to set out
later in 2017.

_Contracts for Difference_

In 2011, the Government announced its intention to move from the RO to a scheme based on CfDs in “Planning our
electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity”. CfDs were introduced to provide efficient
and long-term support for low-carbon generation, and to increase revenue certainty for generators.

A CfD provides a variable top-up to the wholesale electricity price that a generator can theoretically achieve by selling
its electricity in the wholesale market. The CfD is entered into between a renewable electricity generator and the Low Carbon


-----

Contracts Company Limited, a limited company owned by the Government (the “LCCC”), as CfD counterparty, under
which payments are made by reference to a fixed price for each MWh of electricity produced by the generator, known as the
strike price. The generator sells the electricity in the wholesale market outside the CfD. When a specified market price
(which, for a baseload generator is calculated with a market reference wholesale electricity price based on season-ahead
prices) is:

    - below the strike price, if the generator generates, the generator receives a top-up payment from the LCCC for the
difference between the market reference electricity wholesale price and the strike price;

    - above the strike price, if the generator generates, the generator must pay back to the LCCC the difference between
the market reference electricity wholesale price and the strike price.

Strike prices under a CfD are indexed for inflation. The LCCC is funded by electricity suppliers, which pass the cost on
to customers.

As a result, the generator has stability in respect of the price of the electricity that it generates from renewable sources
for the term of the CfD, normally expected to be 15 years. The Government intends that the stabilisation of revenue under
CfDs will increase the rate of investment and lower the cost of capital, thereby reducing costs to customers.

CfDs are awarded through “allocation rounds”, each of which has a pre-determined budget for CfDs divided into three
“pots”, one each for established technologies, less-established technologies and biomass conversions, respectively.

The first allocation round of CfDs allocation concluded in February 2015 and resulted in the procurement of 2.1GW of
capacity at a total cost of £315 million. The second allocation round of CfD (Pot 2) opened on 3 April 2017 and covers
Offshore Wind, Advanced Conversion Technologies, Anaerobic Digestion, Dedicated biomass with CHP (combined heat and
power), Wave, Tidal and Geothermal. In November 2016, the Government announced its intention to release £290 million
worth of CfDs per year for projects to be commissioned in 2021/22 and a further £290 million for projects to be
commissioned in 2022/23. Biomass conversion projects are not eligible to bid in the second allocation round of CfDs.

_Investment Contracts_

To bridge the temporal gap between the RO Scheme and the awarding of CfDs under the CfD Regime, the Government
decided to issue an early form of CfDs called Investment Contracts pursuant to the FIDeR regime in advance of the full
implementation of the CfD Regime. Investment Contracts were introduced to avoid any major hiatus in investment during the
changes to the market under the Electricity Market Reform ahead of implementation of CfDs. Investment Contracts were
awarded if the Government considered that, without the Investment Contract, there was a significant risk that the electricity
generation to which that Investment Contract relates would not occur or would be significantly delayed.

In April 2014, DECC announced that eight renewable electricity projects received Investment Contracts, with strike
prices based on December 2013 strike prices. We received one of these Investment Contracts in respect of our third biomass
unit.

_Capacity Market_

The Capacity Market is designed to help address concerns about the future security of electricity supply. In Capacity
Market auctions, participants bid for capacity market agreements under which they commit to generate at times of system
stress. Under the capacity market agreements, the generators are entitled to fixed monthly payments which provide valuable
guaranteed revenue for the investors of generation plants. Generators are, however, subject to penalties if they do not deliver
energy during a system stress event, which occurs when the system operator has to resort to emergency actions in order to
balance supply. A forecast of future demand is made four years in advance. The net capacity required to meet a Governmentset reliability standard will then be procured through a Capacity Market auction.

Generation units which benefit from a CfD or an Investment Contract or which receive support under the RO Scheme
are not eligible to participate in the Capacity Market at the same time. Consequently, our biomass units are not eligible for
the Capacity Market, but two of our coal-fired units currently participate in the Capacity Market.

The auctions run under a descending clock format, starting with offers of £75/kW and gradually reducing until the
minimum price is reached at which the supply of capacity offered by bidders is equal to the volume required. One-year
capacity market agreements at the clearing price are offered to existing generators and demand-side responders that were
successful in the auction. The length of agreement can vary depending on the nature of investment, with new plants being
entitled to long-term agreements (15 years), to encourage investment in new generation assets, and refurbished plants being
offered three-year agreements. Other generators are offered 1-year contracts. During the delivery year, capacity providers
will receive monthly payments for their agreed obligation at the auction clearing price. Providers are expected to be available
to respond with their agreed generation volumes or to reduce their demand when called on by the System Operator at times of
system stress.


-----

The Government has acknowledged with respect to previous T-4 Capacity Market Auctions that clearing prices were
not sufficient to incentivise new electricity generating capacity to be built, in particular the inability to secure proposals of
new, large-scale, lower emission gas generation. In response, the Government has proposed to introduce several changes to
the Capacity Market mechanism. To reduce “speculative bids”, in 2016 the Government doubled the level of credit cover per
MW each bidder must have in place for the capacity it proposes, and raised termination fees for plants that wished to exit the
Capacity Market mechanism prior to the end of its existing capacity market agreements. Furthermore, the System Operator
revised upward its demand target for the upcoming auctions, leading to the market anticipating higher capacity payments
outturn.

The T-4 Capacity Market Auction in December 2016 secured 52.4GW of capacity for delivery in 2020-2021, at a
clearing price of £22.50/kW. Although higher than expected, consensus views the clearing price as insufficient to trigger
investments in new gas-fired generation. The first capacity market agreements had been intended to begin in the winter of
2018, but, citing a need for additional security of supply in winter 2017, the System Operator held a T-1 auction earlier than
scheduled in January 2017 with the stated aim of procuring capacity for the immediately following winter. This auction
secured 54.4GW of capacity for delivery at a clearing price of £6.95/kW (kilowatt).

_The Emissions Performance Standard_

The Energy Act 2013 introduced the EPS, which limits emissions from new fossil fuel power stations with an
electricity generating capacity above 50MW and received development consent after 18 February 2014. The EPS will
effectively ensure that no new coal-fired power stations may be developed, unless equipped with carbon capture and storage
(“CCS”) technology. CCS technology enables CO2 emissions from industrial plants to be captured and stored permanently
deep underground, thereby removing carbon emissions created by power stations from the atmosphere.

The operator of any new fossil fuel plant at or over 50MW will have a total tonnage allowance of CO2 within which it
must ensure that emissions from the plant remain. The EPS has initially been set at an annual limit equivalent to 450g of CO2
per kWh for a baseload (continuously operating) generating plant. The limit is intended to be reviewed every three years, but
plants operating at that point will remain subject to that standard until 2045.

The Energy Act 2013 and the Emissions Performance Standard Regulations 2015 also set out detailed circumstances in
which the EPS may be modified or suspended in order to maintain the UK’s security of supply, and provides powers for an
appropriate national authority to establish a monitoring and enforcement regime.

**OUR BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are an innovative vertically-integrated electricity generation and supply business with operations in the UK and the
U.S. We own and operate the largest power plant in the UK by generation capacity with an installed capacity of
approximately 4GW, mainly via our six 645MW generation units. Our business is comprised of three segments with an
integrated strategy where we source and produce fuel, generate and supply electricity, gas and wood pellets to end customers.

We are an important part of the UK’s energy infrastructure, supplying approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s electricity
in 2016. We generated approximately 16 per cent. of the UK’s renewable energy in 2015. Based on the 2015-2016
compliance period, we are also the UK’s largest single-site generator of renewable energy. We provide flexible and reliable
generation and produced 65 per cent. of our electricity for the year ended 31 December 2016 from sustainable biomass,
making us a core part of the UK’s decarbonisation strategy. Our three 645MW biomass-fired generation units receive
regulatory support, leading to enhanced earnings streams with a significant component of stable and predictable revenue. Our
three 645MW capacity coal-fired generation units provide important support services to the UK’s electricity system including
greater reliability and flexibility at times of low De-rated Reserve Margins and system stress. Our biomass-fired generation
assets are served by an efficient and reliable biomass supply chain comprising dedicated port handling infrastructure and rail
paths, thereby enhancing security of supply of fuel for our electricity generation activities. In response to the growth in
inflexible, intermittent renewable capacity on the electricity grid, we recently acquired four rapid-response OCGT
development projects with the potential to provide flexible and reliable electricity to the UK electricity system and diversify
our future energy generation capability.

Taken together, Haven Power and the Opus Group were, as of 31 October 2016, the fifth largest supplier of electricity
to businesses in the UK by volume. Haven Power and the Opus Group provide us with a direct route into the retail market for
much of the electricity we generate. We believe counterparties to retail sales place fewer credit restrictions on us than
wholesale market counterparties and selling to the retail market provides us with a more diversified counterparty base with
less overall counterparty credit risk.

We produce compressed wood pellets from sustainable sources in two plants in the southern United States and use
those pellets as fuel for our biomass-fired generation. We have recently announced our successful bid to acquire a third wood
pellet manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which we expect to complete by the end of April 2017. We expect the acquisition
to significantly increase our production capacity during 2018. We have also entered into long-term contracts with wood pellet
suppliers in North America and Europe to support a long-term, stable supply of biomass.

Drax Group plc is listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange under stock ticker “DRX”, and is part of
the FTSE 250 Index. Drax Group plc’s market capitalisation as at 13 April 2017 was approximately £1,290 million. Our pro
_forma consolidated net debt as at 31 December 2016 was £507.6 million._

The three segments of our business are:

    - Generation: Through our Generation segment, we play a significant role in providing reliable renewable baseload
electricity generation capacity, enhancing the security of the UK’s electricity supply and supporting the UK’s
transition to a low-carbon future. In 2016, we generated approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s electricity needs (of
which approximately 65 per cent. was generated from sustainable biomass) from the Power Station, located near
Selby, Yorkshire. In 2015 our sustainable biomass-fired generation units produced approximately 16 per cent. of the
UK’s renewable electricity at approximately 10 per cent. of the cost to consumers.

Our three biomass-fired generation units qualify for attractive regulatory support via the CfD and RO regimes which
provide the Power Station with financial support to facilitate the production of baseload electricity. The six
generation units at the Power Station are the largest in their class in the UK, with an output capacity of up to
645MW each, compared with the typical coal-fired thermal generation unit size for larger power stations in the UK
of approximately 500MW. Each of the generation units are operated independently and have the flexibility to
generate electricity between 200MW and 645MW. We have identified a growing need for system support services
and have signed and renewed a number of contracts with the System Operator to supply Ancillary Services systems
support. Furthermore, we recently acquired four rapid-response OCGT generation projects across England and
Wales which, if and when developed, we expect will benefit from the stable earnings afforded by capacity market
agreements.

    - Retail: We supply electricity and gas to businesses through Haven Power (Supplier of the Year at the 2016 Energy
Awards) and the Opus Group, which we acquired in February 2017. Both Haven Power and the Opus Group provide
us with a credit-efficient route to market for a proportion of the electricity we generate and the ROCs that our
Generation segment earns. The majority of Haven Power’s sales volumes are with larger I&C customers such as
Manchester Airport Group and Thames Water, while the Opus Group is focused on small and medium sized
enterprises (“SME”). Taken together, Haven Power and the Opus Group were, as of 31 October 2016, the fifth


-----

largest supplier of electricity to businesses in the UK by volume. We expect the Opus Group, a leading challenger
brand to the Big Six in the SME market, to enhance and broaden our retail offering in the SME market with a wider
product range than we previously offered, including, for example, gas. We also own Billington Bioenergy, a
biomass pellet supplier to businesses and households.

    - Biomass Supply: Through our Biomass Supply segment based in the southern United States, we manufacture and
supply compressed wood pellets from sustainably managed forests. We take low-grade wood and residues from
other wood processing industries and transform them into pellets that can be transported around the world to supply
low-carbon energy. We operate two wood pellet manufacturing facilities in Bastrop, Louisiana and Gloster,
Mississippi, both of which are certified under the Sustainable Biomass Program, an industry standard,
demonstrating that biomass is legally and sustainably sourced. Our manufacturing facilities have a combined annual
capacity of 900,000 tonnes, which we expect to increase through planned expansion to 1,050,000 tonnes by the end
of 2017. In addition, following the acquisition of a third wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania,
Louisiana (which we expect will complete by the end of April 2017), we expect to increase our combined annual
capacity by a further 450,000 tonnes during 2018. In 2016, our total biomass production was approximately 607,000
tonnes. We operate a port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which includes two 40,000 tonne storage domes to
transport pellets from our own manufacturing facilities and from approved third-party suppliers to the UK for use by
our Generation segment. The port facility can load more than 15,000 tonnes of pellets per day and can accommodate
Panamax Vessels.

**Our History**

The Power Station was originally built, owned and operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board and was
constructed in two phases, with the first three electricity generation units installed by 1974 and the second three units
installed by 1986. In 1988, flue-gas desulphurisation (“FGD”) equipment was fitted to all six units, enabling the Power
Station to operate within sulphur dioxide (“SO2”) emissions restrictions.

The Power Station was transferred to National Power as part of the structuring and privatisation of the UK electricity
supply industry under the Electricity Act 1989. In 1999, National Power sold the Power Station to AES Corporation, which
financed the acquisition partly with bank debt.

In 2003, we underwent a restructuring, with AES Corporation withdrawing from its ownership position. The creditors
voted to retain their interest and the final restructuring proposal was implemented in December 2003, with Drax Group
Limited as the ultimate holding company and our creditors as owners of Drax Group Limited.

In 2005, we completed a refinancing and Drax Group plc’s ordinary shares were listed and admitted to trading on the
London Stock Exchange on 15 December 2005.

In 2009, we acquired Ipswich-based Haven Power, which was launched in 2006 to specifically serve the electricity
needs of SME customers and to provide an alternative to the large multinational electricity suppliers. Since 2009, Haven
Power has grown its SME business and established a business in the large I&C sector.

In 2015, we commissioned our two wood pellet manufacturing facilities in the U.S. as well as the port facility in Baton
Rouge, Louisiana required to load and ship wood pellets to the Power Station.

In December 2016, we acquired four OCGT projects. In February 2017, we acquired the Opus Group, a UK businessto-business supplier of electricity and gas which is focused on the SME market.

In April 2017, we announced our successful bid to acquire the assets of Louisiana Pellets. Louisiana Pellets is the
owner and developer of a wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana. The auction price was
US$35.4 million. A court hearing approving the auction result was held on 4 April 2017 and completion of the sale is
expected to occur by the end of April 2017.

_Conversion to sustainable biomass_

Since 2012, we have transformed the Power Station into a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator, and have
converted three of our six generation units to burn sustainable biomass instead of coal.


-----

The first of the Power Station’s six generation units was converted to run on sustainable biomass in April 2013 with
support under the RO Scheme. The second unit ran as a high-range co-firing unit (burning more than 85 per cent. sustainable
biomass) from May 2014 and was fully converted to sustainable biomass in October 2014 (with support under the RO
Scheme). A third unit, which had been operating as a high-range co-firing unit since October 2015, fully converted to
generate using sustainable biomass on 21 December 2016 under the CfD Regime after the European Commission granted
state aid approval of our CfD for this unit conversion. For further information on the RO Scheme and the CfD Regime, see
“Industry Overview—UK clean energy legislation—The Renewables Obligation” and “Industry Overview—Overview of
_Electricity Market Reform—Contracts for Difference”._

**Strengths**

**_We are an important part of the UK’s energy infrastructure._**

We are a major provider of electricity in the UK, supplying approximately 7 per cent. of the UK’s requirements in
2016. We generated approximately 16 per cent. of the UK’s renewable energy in 2015. Based on the 2015-2016 compliance
period, we are also the largest single-site UK renewable energy generator through our biomass-fired generation units. As a
vertically-integrated business active in each of the sourcing, electricity generation and supply businesses, we are a significant
participant in the overall UK energy landscape.

Our primary generation facility, the Power Station, is the largest power station in the UK by generation capacity, with
approximately 4GW of installed capacity. The Power Station has six generation units, three generating electricity from
sustainable biomass and three from coal, meaning that we are not dependent on a single fuel source. These units each have an
output capacity of up to 645MW, compared to a typical coal-fired thermal generation unit size of approximately 500MW in
the UK, and are the most efficient units in their class in the UK, enabling them to run profitably at times when others cannot.
Each of the generation units can be operated independently to provide baseload electricity and has the flexibility to generate
between 200MW and 645MW, enabling them to provide a range of generation and system support services to the electricity
network.

During the last decade, the UK energy market has changed significantly due to the increase in inflexible, renewable
generation technology and the closure of significant volumes of thermal plants. De-rated Reserve Margins are significantly
lower now than they were ten years ago. As a result, there is a need for generation assets in the UK which can generate at any
point in time and which can alter their generation profiles to support the changing levels of intermittent generation. The
flexible, responsive and reliable characteristics of our coal-fired and biomass-fired generation units allow us to meet this need
and play an important role in the UK’s security of supply.

**_Our earnings benefit from a high degree of stability and visibility._**

Our earnings have a high degree of stability as a result of:

    - the support for our three biomass-fired generation units under the RO Scheme and CfD Regime;

    - opportunities for Ancillary Services revenues;

    - Capacity Market payments for two of our coal-fired generation units;

    - long-term fixed price formula biomass contracts;

    - retail margins; and


-----

    - a strong hedging policy.

Based on our past performance, we expect our gross margin to be derived predominantly from non-commodity exposed
sources of earnings in the future. As a consequence of this, the volatility of our earnings which characterised the cash flows
in previous years should be substantially reduced.

_Biomass-fired generation_

Generation from the Power Station’s existing biomass generation units benefits from a UK legislative and contractual
framework designed to support renewable energy sources. Our recently converted third biomass-fired generation unit
receives support through the CfD Regime, while our other two biomass-fired generation units are supported under the RO
Scheme. As a renewable fuel, biomass is exempt from the EU ETS and Carbon Price Support.

Our CfD is a private law contract between Drax Power and a government-owned entity, the Low Carbon Contracts
Company Limited. Under our CfD we are paid any shortfall, and repay any excess, between a strike price and a market
reference price calculated as the average market price for electricity in the UK market over a given period. Our CfD is
indexed to UK consumer price inflation and extends to March 2027. It provides an effective hedge against the electricity
price at current market prices and thereby supports earnings stability and visibility for our business.

The RO Scheme, established in 2002 to encourage the development of large-scale renewable electricity capacity in the
UK, places an obligation on licensed electricity suppliers either to source a proportion of the electricity they provide to
customers from eligible renewable sources or to make a buy-out payment. The sourcing of renewable energy is demonstrated
by the supplier presenting ROCs (equivalent in number to the supplier’s individual obligation) to the administrator of the RO
Scheme, Ofgem. ROCs are issued by Ofgem to renewable generators for each MWh of renewable electricity generated in
different proportions based on the type of technology used. Electricity suppliers can source ROCs from renewable electricity
generators. ROCs are tradable certificates with no fixed price and therefore the amount an electricity supplier pays for a ROC
is a matter for negotiation between the supplier and generator. However, the DBEIS sets the level of the obligation of a
supplier to source renewable electricity each year using a headroom calculation which provides a set margin between the
predicted generation (supply of ROCs) and the level of the obligation (demand for ROCs). This aims to reduce the possibility
of supply exceeding the obligation in any given year and therefore provides some stability to the price of ROCs. As a result
of the RO Scheme our Generation segment therefore receives ROCs for its biomass-fired generation that, as a verticallyintegrated renewable energy generator, we can use in our Retail segment or sell to third parties.

We currently receive one ROC for each MWh of generation from our first two biomass-fired generation units, on top of
the purchase price for the sale of electricity produced. ROC support for these two units extends until March 2027 and through
this period is grandfathered by the Government at the level of one ROC for each MWh of generation. The buy-out price for
ROCs includes an element of inflation indexation. A proportion of the underlying electricity that these two units produce is
sold on a forward basis in order to improve the stability and visibility of our cash flows.

_Ancillary Services_

The System Operator is required to balance supply and demand and to ensure the secure and stable operation of the
transmission system. It routinely contracts with generators to provide specific contracts for Ancillary Services including
adjusting electricity generation to balance the system. We are able to provide Ancillary Services to the System Operator such
as frequency response (altering output to ensure the frequency of electricity on the grid is within statutory limits) and
“reactive power” services (enabling the System Operator to manage the voltage profile of the transmission system within
certain parameters). Only a limited number of generators can provide some of these services in Great Britain, and we expect
this number of generators to reduce over time as further thermal plants close. As Great Britain transitions to greater, more
intermittent low carbon generation, the revenue that we receive from Ancillary Services is expected to be increasingly
important. We believe that the large, flexible characteristics of the generating assets we operate are well suited to offer these
services, providing an opportunity for further contract-based revenues.

_Capacity Market Agreements_

The UK has established a Capacity Market system to support security and reliability of supply for the end consumer.
The Capacity Market guarantees selected generators a fixed price for maintaining a specified generation capacity for a given
period of time through an auction system. Generators receive either a one-year capacity market agreement or 15-year
capacity market agreement depending on whether they are entering the auction for existing or potential new plants,
respectively. Existing plant requiring significant refurbishment may also be eligible for three-year capacity market
agreements.

All of our generation units which do not currently benefit from support under the RO Scheme or CfD Regime are
currently eligible to participate in Capacity Market auctions for one-year capacity market agreements. We currently have
capacity market agreements for two of our coal-fired units and the three small ancillary gas turbines located at the Power


-----

Station, which are expected to result in contract-based revenues in excess of £80 million between 2017 and 2021 in the
aggregate.

_Retail_

The Opus Acquisition added an established and profitable energy supplier in the SME market to our Group, in addition
to our Haven Power business. Opus enjoys industry leading customer retention levels and the potential for further growth; for
example, by allowing our Group to provide a dual fuel offering for the first time, while Haven Power is well established in
the I&C market and is seeking to increase its number of SME customers. The Opus Group increases our presence in the SME
market which is characterised by higher gross margins per MWh compared to the I&C market. Haven Power and the Opus
Group provide a direct route into the market for a significant amount of the electricity we generate and a significant
proportion of the ROCs issued to us.

_Hedging policy_

The earnings of our Generation segment are further supported by our strong hedging policy under which we sell
electricity generated by the Power Station up to two years ahead. This allows us to secure a margin on such electricity at
times when bark spreads or dark green spreads are attractive, thereby increasing visibility with respect to our future
Generation segment earnings. For example, as of February 2017, we had forward-sold approximately 17.8 TWh and 7.0 TWh
of electricity for delivery in the 2017 and 2018, respectively.

**_We enjoy relatively low levels of volatility in our fuel input costs through active management of our supply chain._**

We actively manage our biomass supply chain to enhance security of supply and support sufficient sourcing of wood
pellet volumes to generate electricity. Our wood pellet manufacturing facilities have a combined annual capacity of 900,000
tonnes, which we expect to increase through planned expansion to 1,050,000 tonnes by the end of 2017. In addition,
following the acquisition of a third wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana (which we expect will
complete by the end of April 2017), we expect to increase our combined annual capacity by a further 450,000 tonnes during
2018. Our first two facilities continue to play a growing role in the sourcing of our feedstock and our new facility is expected
to do the same. We also operate a U.S. port facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with an annual export capacity at 2,100,000
tonnes (with the scope to expand further to 3,000,000 tonnes), in excess of our current self-supply, allowing us to consolidate
supply from third-parties to drive further supply chain efficiencies.

Our Biomass Supply segment manufactures compressed wood pellets, from sustainably sourced feedstock, for use as a
low carbon, renewable fuel in our biomass-fired generation units. The U.S. operations are strategically positioned near one
another to optimise the time and cost of wood pellet deliveries to ports.

In 2016, our wood pellet manufacturing facilities shipped approximately 560,000 tonnes of wood pellets to the Power
Station, with the balance currently being sourced from third-party suppliers based in North America and Europe under a
series of predominantly long-term contracts from sources also certified as sustainable. We aim to increase the share of
internally sourced pellets to at least 30 per cent. in the future.

Our ability to source an increasing proportion of our biomass requirements internally via self-supply allows us to better
manage the quality of feedstock and the timing of deliveries. This self-supply enables us to optimise generation and reduce
the risk of fuel shortages and supply chain issues curtailing generation from the Power Station and to better ensure a stable
cost of biomass, thus reducing exposure to commodity price fluctuations. At the same time, we maintain the flexibility to
participate in the biomass spot market when biomass prices are attractive.

Our exposure to commodity prices is managed through a commercial hedging strategy which seeks to enter into
forward sales of electricity and purchases of associated fuel and the carbon emissions allowances. Additionally, to manage
the currency risks associated with our biomass purchase contracts, which are mainly in U.S. dollars, we actively hedge our
position and have put in place a rolling five-year hedging strategy to that effect.

Due to the conversion of three of our coal-fired generation units to biomass and our expected lower need for coal in the
future, we have reduced the level of coal stocks held on-site, and intend to further reduce such stocks over time.

**_We operate the most efficient coal/biomass-fired power station in its class in the UK._**

The Power Station’s biomass-fired and coal-fired generation units are the most efficient in their class in the UK, based
on the proportion of the energy content of the fuel that is ultimately converted into electricity. Our conversion of three coalfired generation units to biomass demonstrates our technological capabilities while proving our ability to take action in light
of changes in the regulatory framework.

The changes in the UK regulatory environment over the past decade provided a catalyst to upgrade our generation
assets by converting three of our six electricity generation units to biomass and improving our remaining coal-fired


-----

generation units to make them more efficient and to reduce operating costs. We continue to invest regularly in our asset base
to ensure that the Power Station maintains a high level of fuel efficiency.

Following the third successful conversion of one of our coal-fired generation units to biomass in 2016, we are now the
UK’s largest single-site renewable generator based on capacity. We have been able to achieve this without compromising our
ability to operate each unit independently, and we remain flexible to ensure we can continue to provide the essential services
required by the System Operator and can maximise the value of our generation business.

We operate a “safety first” business, and emphasise the health, safety and welfare of our employees and contractors, as
part of our vision in delivering operational excellence across the Group. Each business unit and corporate team has local
arrangements in place, reflecting the operating environment and hazards inherent in the various workplaces, to ensure that
high standards are set and maintained. Safety remains at the centre of our operational philosophy and we are continuing to
work to improve our performance across the Group.

**_Strong financial metrics and conservative financial policy_**

We have a conservative financial policy and have maintained a low leverage since we listed on the London Stock
Exchange in December 2005.

Over the last three calendar years, our average net leverage has been 0.7x. After the recent Opus Acquisition for a
consideration of £367 million, our pro forma CfD Adjusted net leverage as at 31 December 2016 only increased to 1.7x. We
are committed to maintaining leverage at a level that is consistent with our current credit rating, which supports our trading
strategy.

We are focussed on targeted selective investments which we expect to help us to continue to diversify our earnings and
cash flows sources within the framework of our conservative financial policy.

Following our decision to adapt the maintenance and upgrade schedule for our remaining coal-fired generation units to
reflect lower expected output and the anticipated end of electricity generation from coal by 2025, we expect our annual
maintenance capital expenditures to decrease to levels substantially lower than those seen during the previous two years. We
expect our maintenance future capital expenditures to primarily consist of investments to upgrade our facilities to, among
other things, comply with applicable regulatory regimes, which we expect to translate into greater operating cash flow going
forward.

**_We have a pioneering management team with proven experience in leading a successful business transformation._**

Our management team has proven its ability to lead our business through an evolving regulatory and commodity
market environment. We have successfully transformed what was initially a pure coal generation business into a verticallyintegrated generator and supplier of predominantly renewable electricity and now have industry-leading experience and
knowledge with respect to biomass and its related supply chain logistics.

Our management team is complemented by a skilled operating team who are at the forefront of biomass conversion
technology, including the mechanical, engineering, electrical and civil works required for conversion. We believe the
conversion of three of our generation units to biomass remains Europe’s largest decarbonisation project and was delivered on
budget.

Our operational experience in handling biomass is also market-leading. We have developed innovative fuel-handling
systems, logistics and storage solutions for biomass fuel as well as a bespoke technically-advanced covered rail wagon with a
specialised door design and a patented product flow control system to manage biomass during discharge.

As a result of the conversion project, we have developed an in-depth understanding of the scientific and technological
effects of burning a range of biomass fuels, as well as of the critical combustion characteristics of such fuels.

We have also put in place a biomass sustainability policy, which includes comprehensive carbon foot-printing across
our biomass supply chain and regular independent supplier audits. All of our biomass is procured in accordance with this
sustainability policy.

**Strategy**

Our strategy is to deliver a stronger, more predictable, long-term financial performance for the Group along with
greater diversification in the markets in which we operate. By doing so, we seek to continue to play an important role in the
way energy is generated, supplied and used as the UK moves to a low carbon future.

**_Maintain stable earnings visibility by focusing on contractual revenue streams_**

In the Generation segment, we plan to significantly further improve the visibility of future earnings and cash flows by
increasing the proportion of our contracted earnings through Ancillary Services and Capacity Market payments. We expect


-----

this, combined with the support we receive under the CfD Regime and ROC Scheme, will result in a reduced level of
commodity markets exposure and increased stability and visibility of earnings.

The Ancillary Services market is an important market for us. The flexible, dispatchable and responsive nature of our
generation assets positions us well to compete in the market. With the changing grid dynamic this market could grow
significantly.

Separately, we have secured capacity market agreements worth in excess of £80 million between 2017 and 2021 in the
aggregate. Both types of agreement ensure system stability and provide us with revenue streams independent of electricity
price fluctuations.

We believe that more rapid response power plants will be required to keep the UK’s electricity system stable in the
future. If we can secure attractive 15-year capacity market agreements to provide the base revenues required, we intend to
address this increased need for flexible electricity by developing the four recently acquired 299MW OCGT projects, while
simultaneously diversifying our generating capacity. Subject to completion of construction of these OCGT plants and their
ability to secure capacity market agreements, two of these plants could be generating electricity as early as 2020/21, and the
other two by 2023/24, which would, in total, add the potential for more than approximately 1.2GW of rapid response OCGT
generation into our generation portfolio.

We also stand ready to convert more of our coal-fired generation units to biomass subject to appropriate regulatory
support or economic conditions, and are actively engaged in research and development activities to identify and deliver
opportunities for low-cost biomass generation and supply chain activities.

**_Profitably grow our Retail segment_**

Our objective is to increase the proportion of revenue and earnings generated by our Retail segment by increasingly
focusing on the higher-margin SME market and by evaluating options for further margin enhancement such as product
alternatives and efficiency enhancement. We expect the Opus Acquisition to further enhance and broaden our retail offering
with a wider product range, including gas. Our efforts to integrate the Opus Group with the operations of our existing
supplier Haven Power are fully underway. To improve profitability, we are in the process of replacing the Opus Group’s
third-party supply arrangements with less expensive internal arrangements.

The Opus Group’s expertise in SME electricity and gas sales, combined with Haven Power’s track record in the I&C
market and our generation capacity and commodity risk management expertise provide us with a strong platform for growth
in the Retail segment. We believe the knowledge, resources and platforms shared by the combined business across both the
I&C and the SME markets will enable us to deliver new products and services and enhanced market coverage to drive market
share growth.

**_Expand wood pellet self-supply through targeted investments and acquisitions_**

We intend to supply the Power Station with at least 30 per cent. of its annual demand for wood pellets from our own
production in the future. To achieve this goal, we will consider targeted acquisitions if we can identify attractive
opportunities, including the potential acquisition of financially distressed pellet plants in the U.S. In addition to our expected
acquisition of our third wood pellet manufacturing facility in Urania, Louisiana, we intend to participate in an auction to
purchase a wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Woodville, Texas. We have also identified the opportunity to make
incremental capital investment in our existing U.S. wood pellet manufacturing facilities to increase capacity, allowing a
greater utilisation of the lowest cost residue material, helping to reduce the overall cost of biomass, at an estimated capital
cost of approximately US$15 million. We intend to deliver the increased 150,000 tonnes of capacity by the end of 2017. We
further intend to optimise supply chain and logistics operations for our Generation segment, and to utilise the flexibility of
self-supply to manage production, to allow it to benefit from attractively priced biomass cargoes in the spot market. We are
also exploring opportunities to pursue third-party supply contracts with respect to the wood pellets produced by our Biomass
Supply segment to further enhance the flexibility and value in our supply chain.

**_Continue to focus on operational excellence_**

We continue to work at improving our performance across all segments, and are a consistent top quartile performer for
safety performance. Having established ourselves as a leader in managing sustainable biomass based electricity generation
across the entire value chain, we aim to leverage this expertise to continue developing our business.

We are focused on improving the operational gains from our wood pellet manufacturing facilities, responding to
planned and unplanned events at the Power Station through seamless teamwork to maintain high availability and ensure an
excellent standard of customer service at our Retail segment. Safety and sustainability remain at the centre of our operational
philosophy, recognising that excellent safety performance at the Power Station and our biomass plants drives efficiency and
improves the productivity of our assets. All of our biomass is procured in line with our industry leading sustainability criteria
ensuring that the wood pellets we use for electricity generation are sustainable and low carbon.


-----

**Recent Developments**

In April 2017, we announced our successful bid to acquire the assets of Louisiana Pellets. Louisiana Pellets is the
owner and developer of a wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana. The auction price was
US$35.4 million. A court hearing approving the auction result was held on 4 April 2017 and completion of the sale is
expected to by the end of April 2017.

**Principal activities and markets**

Our three principal activities are:

    - the generation of electricity, which is carried out through our Generation segment;

    - the supply of electricity (predominantly low-carbon renewable energy), gas and wood pellets to business customers
in the retail market, which is carried out through our Retail segment; and

    - the production and supply of sustainable wood pellets at our processing facilities in the U.S., which is carried out
through our Biomass Supply segment.

**Generation**

We currently generate our electricity via our main asset, the Power Station, which is owned by Drax Power.

_The Power Station: General_

The Power Station is located in North Yorkshire, on the banks of the River Ouse, between the towns of Selby and
Goole. The Power Station site, comprising approximately 1,850 acres, is located close to supplies of cooling water and has
convenient road and rail access to nearby port capacity.

The Power Station is the largest power station in the UK, with approximately 4GW of connected installed capacity
from its six main generation units, each of which can be operated independently. Each of the Power Station’s six electricity
generation units have a capacity of 645MW of electricity. Between 2008 and 2012, all the high pressure and low pressure
turbines were upgraded to increase the efficiency of generation, reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Between
2013 and 2015, three of the six generation units were converted to run on sustainable biomass. Three OCGT generation units,
each with a capacity of 32MW, provide standby power to start up the main generating plant and to supply power to the
Transmission System if necessary.

The Power Station’s main generation units are able to burn a range of fuels, with three units burning coal and coal
derivatives, such as petroleum coke and coal mining residue “pond fines” (waste by-products of the quarrying process), and
three units running on sustainable biomass in the form of wood pellets. This diversification of fuel avoids reliance on a single
fuel, enables us to capture value from commodity market cycles and, in the case of sustainable biomass, avoids costs
associated with purchasing carbon emissions allowances under the EU ETS. In 2016 and 2015, for each MWh of electricity
generated from sustainable biomass, the Power Station emitted 86 per cent. and 80 per cent., respectively, less CO2 compared
to electricity generated from the Power Station’s coal fired units over the full life cycle. This calculation compares the supply
chain emissions for all biomass used by us against the CO2 emissions which would have been created through the combustion
of coal. For the purposes of this calculation, the biogenic CO2 emissions from burning sustainable biomass at the Power
Station are considered to be zero in line with the methodology developed by the UNFCCC and reflecting that the CO2
released in the process of burning sustainable biomass has been absorbed from the atmosphere during the growth of the
feedstock. We currently have three generation units converted to biomass, which are capable of burning approximately seven
to eight million tonnes of sustainable biomass per year. For further information on carbon emissions, see “Industry
_Overview—Electricity market: regulatory context—The EU Emissions Trading System” and “Industry Overview—UK clean_
_energy legislation”._

The UK electricity market that we operate in is changing. A greater amount of intermittent generating capacity is
becoming available to the market and at the same time older and less efficient thermal plants with the ability to generate
electricity more consistently are withdrawing. In this context, there is a greater need for forms of generation which are
flexible and responsive to the needs of the electricity grid. Generation systems that are able to turn up at times of peak
demand and down at times of excess supply provide certainty of electricity availability and flexibility, if necessary. All
generation units at the Power Station are capable of operating independently and flexibly with a high level of availability,
making them an important component of a stable, secure and well-functioning electricity grid.

Our recent acquisition of four OCGT development projects in December 2016 is expected to, if and when developed,
provide us with gas-fired generation capabilities, in addition to the standby OCGT units at the Power Station, that could be
used to provide quick response flexible generation to support the electricity system.


-----

_The generation process_

To generate electricity from either sustainable biomass or coal, the underlying fuel is pulverised into a powder and then
blown into boilers, where the fuel is burned like gas. The heat generated by the boiler turns de-mineralised water into superheated steam at 568 degrees Celsius, which is fed at high pressure through a series of turbines. The shafts of these turbines
are coupled to large cylindrical electromagnets known as rotors, which produce electricity as the turbine rotates. The
electricity generated is then increased from 23.5kV to 400kV, allowing for the export of electricity onto the Transmission
System. The electricity is eventually reduced to a voltage of 230V for use by customers.

The de-mineralised water in the boilers forms part of a closed system and, once turned into super-heated steam, is
subsequently condensed and recycled back into the boiler to increase the overall efficiency of the generation process. Excess
heat in the form of water vapour is released into the atmosphere by way of cooling towers.

Due to the Power Station’s design, each unit can operate full time as a baseload generator, or can turn up or down or be
taken off line and put back on line with minimal effect on the operating capabilities of the other units. Generation increases
when demand is high, units are available and it is economic for a unit, whether coal or sustainable biomass, to run. In the
competitive UK wholesale electricity market, the economics of running a unit are determined by the short-run marginal cost
of each technology, which is based on the variable cost of generating a unit of electricity for the relevant half-hour. When
there is demand for electricity supply, the generators that are available with the lowest short-run marginal cost operate until
the projected demand in that half-hour is met. As a result of lower wholesale electricity prices in the UK market over the last
two years, the Power Station’s coal-fired generation units are increasingly run to provide system support services—turning
up to meet peak demand periods or being available to provide flexible capacity (headroom and footroom), and turning up or
down according to the requirements of the System Operator. This is evidenced by the number of starts of the coal-fired
generation units increasing from approximately 150 in 2015 to approximately 400 in 2016. In contrast, the biomass-fired
generation units, which benefit from renewable energy support under either the RO Scheme or CfD Regime, are
predominantly delivering baseload electricity.

_Availability_

Availability of the Power Station’s units is influenced by planned maintenance outages, as well as unplanned or forced
outages, which may be required from time to time to rectify malfunctions or other failures. During 2016, the Power Station’s
availability was 77.1 per cent. compared to 85.1 per cent. in 2015, principally due to two major planned outages in 2016 (one
of which took longer to complete than anticipated due to an unplanned equipment failure) compared with one major planned
outage in 2015. In 2016, there were also four smaller planned outages for essential repair work. There were no recordable
injuries resulting in lost time during the outages.

To comply with the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations of 2000, our maintenance regime typically includes a major
planned outage for each of the six units once every four years to enable a detailed examination of each part of the pressure
system plant. Planned outages are usually undertaken during the summer months, when electricity demand is lower. There is
consequently an irregular pattern to planned outages and associated expenditure, since typically in two of every four years
two units will each undergo a major planned outage. Following the Government’s consultation on an end to unabated
electricity generation from coal by 2025, we put in place a leaner maintenance schedule for the three coal-fired generation
units and deferred certain maintenance work. In addition, a major outage that was originally planned for 2017 is now
expected to be undertaken in 2018. This reflects our preference for a single major planned outage in 2017 focused on the
biomass unit in receipt of our CfD.

Unplanned maintenance or forced outages occur on all units due to unexpected plant breakdown, such as boiler tube
leaks. Preventative maintenance is carried out to control and reduce forced outage rates. This work includes the monitoring,
inspection and replacement of operating equipment. The frequency of such work is dependent on the operating and failure
history of each equipment type and takes into account historical maintenance schedules and procedures, manufacturers’
recommendations and statutory inspection requirements. This approach is typical of the industry.

_Fuel Procurement_

The Power Station uses coal and sustainable biomass as fuel. Fuel costs are the most significant driver of cost in the
Generation segment, amounting to £1,180.1 million in 2016, compared to £1,320.5 million in 2015, representing 47.4 per
cent. of the Generation segment’s revenue in 2016.

_Sustainable Biomass_

In 2016, approximately 6.6 million tonnes of sustainable biomass was burned for electricity generation at the Power
Station. Our pellet manufacturing facilities supplied 7.7 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation from sustainable
biomass in 2016 and it is our intention to increase the share of sustainable biomass pellets sourced from our manufacturing
facilities to at least 30 per cent. in the future. To make up the shortfall between our own production capacity for sustainable


-----

biomass pellets and our requirements for sustainable biomass pellets, we have negotiated a portfolio of predominantly longterm biomass fuel supply contracts. Our top five suppliers are contracted to provide the majority of the 2017 volume that we
currently anticipate our operations to require. We do not depend on a sole supplier, and we own two of the three pellet
manufacturing facilities that each have the capacity to supply at least 450,000 tonnes per year of sustainable biomass to us.

In addition, where liquidity permits, we purchase supplemental volumes of sustainable biomass on the spot market each
year.

The sustainable biomass pellets sourced by us are required to meet the Power Station’s fuel specification which, in
turn, is designed to meet the Power Station’s operating requirements and certain sustainability criteria for the electricity
produced from them to be eligible for ROCs and CfD support. The RO Scheme and CfD Regime require, among other things,
that the wood pellets are sourced from sustainably managed forests. We also acquire a small amount of residual agricultural
products including oat husk and saw mill residue.

Supply contracts include penalty mechanisms if the fuel does not meet such specification. We also impose contractual
obligations on our sustainable biomass pellet suppliers requiring them to satisfy the relevant sustainability criteria and
conduct supplier audits using third-party auditors. In 2016, 12 new biomass pellet mills and eight existing suppliers were
audited through this independent process. These audits resulted in the identification of one high-priority issue involving one
potential supplier and we did not contract with this party as a result. In addition, numerous medium-priority issues and
improvement opportunities were identified. Out of the 23 medium-priority issues identified, 14 have been resolved, four are
in progress and five are yet to be actioned.

Most sustainable biomass pellets used by us are sourced from outside the UK and priced in either U.S. dollars,
Canadian dollars or euro. In 2016, 59 per cent. and 22 per cent. of our sustainable biomass supply was imported from the
U.S. and Canada, respectively. The remainder was sourced from various European countries, including Latvia (9 per cent.),
Estonia (5 per cent.), Portugal (3 per cent.) and the UK (2 per cent.). For further information with respect to foreign currency
exchange exposures inherent within the cost of biomass, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations of Drax—Significant Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Derivative Financial Instruments”._

_Biomass Supply Chain_

Biomass pellets are hygroscopic and so readily absorb moisture from the environment. As a result, pellets must be kept
dry and cannot be stored outside. These characteristics required us to develop and construct specialist storage and transport
facilities.

We import wood pellets into the UK via biomass import facilities at each of the ports of Tyne, Hull, Liverpool and
Immingham, together providing a combined total import capacity of more than 11 million tonnes per year. The development
of these large, specialised biomass storage and rail loading facilities at ports supports biomass in transit from the supplier to
the Power Station. Such biomass import facilities are scaled to provide for contingencies should there be rail problems en
route or plant problems at the Power Station.

Our total port storage capacity in the UK is approximately 400,000 tonnes. In addition to storage at ports, we have
approximately 300,000 tonnes of additional storage space available close to the ports and 300,000 tonnes available at the
Power Station.

Wood pellets are transported from ports to the Power Station primarily by rail. Rail paths between UK ports and the
Power Station have been secured to match the total import capacity (11 million tonnes per year). We have, in partnership
with industry specialists, developed a bespoke biomass rail wagon capable of carrying large volumes of biomass with
capacity of almost one third more than that of a coal rail wagon converted to transport biomass. The wagons have covers to
ensure that the biomass pellets are kept dry while moving and have fully automated top and bottom doors, which will allow
loading and unloading to be carried out while the trains are in motion, increasing efficiency in the rail transport operation. At
our UK port facilities and at the Power Station, the pellets are stored in technically advanced storage spaces with dust control
infrastructure to reduce the risk of fire and explosions.

_Coal_

In 2016, approximately 2.7 million tonnes of coal was burned for electricity generation at the Power Station. The
proportion of our generation from coal and coal derivatives has declined over the last three years as we converted three of the
Power Station’s six generation units to run on sustainable biomass. With the remaining three units generating electricity from
coal, we have the ability to burn up to five million tonnes of coal per year.

We purchase coal both on a forward basis and in the spot market to enable us to take advantage of favourable market
conditions, if available. Due to the lower utilisation of the coal units, we have reduced the level of coal stocks held on-site,
and intend to further reduce such stocks in the future. Coal is more readily available than sustainable biomass and the storage
requirements are less stringent, so stock can be held in smaller volumes to allow us to take advantage of short-term spot


-----

opportunities in the power market with spot purchases and deliveries of coal scheduled through the year to supplement stocks
should electricity demand require it.

We purchase coal from a range of sources with the objective of managing our commercial and credit exposure,
environmental obligations such as the IED and diversity of supply. In 2016, approximately 28 per cent. of the coal we used
was sourced from deep and surface mines in the UK and the remaining approximately 72 per cent. was sourced from major
supply basins from Colombia and the U.S. The proportion of coal sourced domestically has steadily decreased over recent
years due to, among other things, environmental regulation, declining domestic production volumes and our increasing
reliance on sustainable biomass to produce electricity. In the future, we expect that the vast majority of coal will continue to
be sourced from international suppliers. For further information, see “Industry Overview—Electricity market: regulatory
_context—Capacity constraints”. We try to avoid buying generic coals where the origin is uncertain._

We hedge our exposure against fluctuations in prices in this respect through financial derivatives contracts. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Drax—Significant Factors
_Affecting Results of Operations—Derivative Financial Instruments”._

_Electricity and ROC sales and trading strategy_

Electricity generated by the Power Station is sold to the wholesale market and via the Retail segment. In 2016 and
2015, the Generation segment derived revenues of £1,879.9 million and £2,163.4 million, respectively, from electricity sales.
Inter-segment sales from the Generation segment to the Retail segment accounted for £686.5 million or 36.5 per cent. and
£702.2 million or 32.5 per cent. of the revenue generated from electricity sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. In the
wholesale market, the majority of our revenues from the sale of electricity and ROCs is derived from sales to the Big Six.
These companies have a more robust credit profile than smaller independent suppliers, and their large supply portfolios
dictate that they naturally have demand for the output from the Power Station. We have robust credit policies in place to limit
the amount of concentration risk we have with any particular counterparty (noting that the counterparty’s appetite to trade
with us is itself based on its assessment of our credit profile) and sales to the Retail segment (as opposed to third-parties)
reduces the Generation segment’s exposure to third-parties by spreading credit risk across a wider customer base. For further
information on the Big Six, see “Industry Overview—The Big Six”. We derived revenues of £541.5 million and
£399.3 million in 2016 and £597.7 million and £468.0 million in 2015 from our top two customers in the Generation
segment, representing approximately 18 per cent. and 13 per cent. respectively, of our consolidated revenue in 2016 and
2015.

The price of electricity is affected by fluctuations in both supply and demand, which in turn are impacted by, among
other things, weather conditions (particularly the availability of wind generation assets) and fluctuations in the market price
of other commodities. To optimise our electricity trading, we utilise all three sub-markets of the wholesale electricity market:
(i) the long-term (predominantly bilateral) forward market, (ii) the short-term (predominantly exchange-traded) market (or
spot market) and (iii) the real-time market (the balancing mechanism). For further information, see “Industry Overview—
_Wholesale—Overview of the wholesale electricity market”._

_Trading sustainable biomass units_

Our strategy for trading our sustainable biomass units seeks to mitigate the volumetric and pricing risks associated with
the nascent third-party biomass supply market by entering into a long-term fuel hedge on sustainable biomass fuel costs.
Sustainable biomass is predominantly acquired on long-term contracts and the basis risk inherent in that contract (for
example, fluctuations in currency arising due to the purchase of volumes in U.S. dollars and/or fluctuations in fuel or freight
costs on transporting the sustainable biomass to the UK) is hedged to the extent we are able to do so, taking into account
market availability. Fibre costs and inflation risks are generally unhedged due to the lack of available hedging products;
however, costs are capped in fibre contracts wherever possible. The support provided by ROCs and our CfD is indexed to UK
inflation (RPI and CPI, respectively) and so provides a partial hedge against inflation.

Our margin is only secured, subject to underlying credit exposure, when the underlying electricity generated by the
Power Station (and, where applicable, the associated ROC) is sold, either on the wholesale markets or through our Retail
segment. This electricity will often be sold on a forward basis, although we retain flexibility to make electricity sales based
on the attractiveness of pricing, liquidity and collateral/credit efficiency. For further information, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Drax—Significant Factors Affecting Results of_
_Operations—Bark Spread and Dark Green Spread”._

For the first two generation units that have been converted to biomass under the RO Scheme, the ROCs arising from
the sustainable biomass generation are either utilised by the Retail segment or sold to third-parties (on a forward basis where
liquidity and pricing permit). For further information on the RO Scheme and ROCs, see “Industry Overview—UK clean
_energy legislation—Operation of the Renewables Obligation”._


-----

For the third unit that has been converted to biomass and benefits from our CfD, our trading strategy aims to ensure
that the price achieved from such sales is closely aligned to the CfD reference price.

The Generation segment sells a significant proportion of its generation to Haven Power, and commenced supplying
electricity to the Opus Group in March 2017. 30.1 per cent. of ROCs received by the Generation segment for the last full
ROC compliance period were sold to Haven Power and it is expected that ROCs will also be sold to the Opus Group.

For the sustainable biomass-fired generation unit that receives subsidy support via the CfD Regime, the mechanics of
the CfD provide a quasi-hedge against fluctuations in the long-term electricity price.

_Trading coal units_

Our strategy for trading our coal units is focused on obtaining attractive dark green spreads when available and having
the units available to capture value from providing Ancillary Services. Ancillary Services are a mix of mandatory services,
bilateral agreements with the System Operator and trades through the Balancing Mechanism. We currently seek to keep the
capacity of one unit for trading close to the time for physical delivery in the day-ahead or spot market, thereby reducing the
risk that electricity is not delivered in periods of a forced outage. The generation capacity of the two remaining coal-fired
generation units is generally offered in mid-term and short-term markets. For further information, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Drax—Significant Factors Affecting Results of_
_Operations—Bark Spread and Dark Green Spread”._

_Trading ROCs_

Two of our sustainable biomass-fired generation units receive support under the RO Scheme and the Power Station
(other than the unit receiving support under the CfD Regime) is accredited by Ofgem as a qualifying renewable plant. The
ROCs issued by Ofgem to the Power Station are held electronically on Ofgem’s registry and are transferred to purchaser
registry accounts when sales are completed.

We are eligible to receive ROCs in respect of our generation from sustainable biomass in our first and second
converted generation units until 2027. For further information on ROCs, see “Industry Overview—UK clean energy
_legislation—Operation of the Renewables Obligation”. In addition, until August 2015, we also received LECs for electricity_
generated from the generation units that had been converted to biomass which could be sold to electricity suppliers. Effective
1 August 2015, the CCL-exemption for the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources was withdrawn and we are
no longer eligible for LECs. During the compliance period between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016, the Power Station
received more ROCs than any other generation plant in the UK. Revenues from the sale of ROCs are, and prior to the
withdrawal of the CCL-exemption, revenues from the sale of LECs were an important part of the Generation segment’s total
revenues, amounting to £548.4 million in 2016 and to £451.8 million in 2015. ROCs and LECs sold to third-party electricity
suppliers contributed revenues of £366.7 million and £290.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. ROCs and LECs not
sold to third party electricity suppliers were sold to the Retail segment, and more specifically (prior to the Opus Acquisition)
to Haven Power. Such sales generated £181.7 million of inter-segment revenues in 2016 and £161.0 million in 2015. The
withdrawal of LEC support for electricity generated from renewable sources and the related loss of LECs had material
negative effects on our EBITDA. We estimate that such negative impact amounted to approximately £30 million in 2015 and
£60 million in 2016.

_Ancillary Services and Capacity Market Payments_

In the Generation segment, we also derive revenues from Ancillary Services, which amounted to £47.3 million in 2016
compared to £14.0 million in 2015. Ancillary Services comprise the provision of a range of system support services
contracted directly with the System Operator. For example, in 2016, we were awarded a 12-month contract to provide black
start capabilities, i.e. services in connection with the recovery of the Transmission System following a partial or total
shutdown of the Transmission System, to the System Operator. The type, length and value of these Ancillary Services will
depend on the requirements of the System Operator, but we expect that these services will become increasingly important due
to the evolving capacity dynamic with an increase in intermittent generation systems such as wind and solar power and a
reduction in flexible capacity.

We are also able to participate in Capacity Market auctions based on the capacity of our coal units. In Capacity Market
auctions, participants bid for capacity market agreements under which they commit to generate at times of system stress. We
have capacity market agreements for two of our coal-fired units. For further information on the Capacity Market, see
“Industry Overview—Overview of Electricity Market Reform—Capacity Market”. We currently hold the following capacity
market agreements:

1. a capacity market agreement paying £6.95 for each kW of capacity of two of the Power Station’s coal units
and three on-site OCGTs for the year commencing 1 October 2017;


-----

2. a capacity market agreement paying £19.40, in 2012 prices, for each kW of capacity of two of the Power
Station’s coal units and three on-site OCGTs for the year commencing 1 October 2018;

3. a capacity market agreement paying £18.00, in 2014/15 prices, for each kW of capacity of two of the Power
Station’s coal units and three on-site OCGTs for the year commencing 1 October 2019; and

4. a capacity market agreement paying £22.50, in 2015/16 prices, for each kW of capacity of two of the Power
Station’s coal units and three on-site OCGTs for the year commencing 1 October 2020.

**Retail**

Our Retail segment is active in the markets for electricity, gas and wood pellet supply through Haven Power
(electricity), the Opus Group (electricity and gas) and Billington Bioenergy (wood pellets). In 2016, the Retail segment
(excluding the Opus Group), had revenues of £1,326.4 million compared to £1,290.0 million in 2015. Opus had revenues of
£572.7 million and £524.3 million in the financial years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, respectively, and revenues of
£462.3 million and £401.4 million in the nine months ended 31 December 2016 and 2015, respectively.

_Haven Power_

Haven Power focuses on providing businesses with electricity supply contracts from a range of simple, flexible and
tailored contracts designed to meet businesses’ power requirements, backed by high standards of customer service. Haven
Power originally operated solely in the non-domestic SME sector, but since 2010 started supplying customers in the I&C
sector. As of 31 December 2016, Haven Power supplied approximately 14.6TWh, compared to 13.8TWh in 2015, and as at
31 October 2016 had a market share in the non-domestic electricity supply sector of 7.2 per cent. by volume of supply. In the
same year, sales amounted to £1,326.4 million, compared to £1,290.0 million in 2015. Haven Power currently has contracted
sales of approximately 13TWh for 2017.

Haven Power acquires a significant proportion of its electricity from the Power Station. This arrangement provides a
credit-efficient alternative route to market for electricity generated by the Power Station and for ROCs for electricity
generated from renewable sources. It also provides Haven Power with the ability to contract for electricity on a forward basis
in a market where independent suppliers can face liquidity issues in the absence of sole-offtake agreements.

In the SME sector, Haven Power offers contracts with diverse pricing to meet the needs and risk profile of its SME
customer base. Examples include the Haven Complete product, which has a fully fixed price designed to provide maximum
budget certainty, and the Haven Pass-Through product, which has a fixed energy cost but passes on certain third-party
charges to the customer entirely. The length of the contracts generally varies from 12 to 60 months.

In addition, Haven Power offers a number of more complex flexible products in the I&C sector, which allow the
customer to choose when to lock-in their electricity prices. Customers using such products may have the ability to fix prices
for electricity for up to five years in advance or to purchase their power at the prevailing market rates for the day or month
ahead.

Haven Power is based in Ipswich, where it leases an office building and employed approximately 382 employees as of
31 December 2016.

_The Opus Group_

We acquired the Opus Group, a UK supplier of electricity and gas with a focus on the SME market on 10 February
2017. As of 31 October 2016, the Opus Group was the sixth largest business power supplier in the UK by meter count with
over 241,000 electricity meters, representing approximately 127,000 customers and a market share in the non-domestic
electricity sector of approximately 9 per cent. by meter count and 2.4 per cent. by volume of supply, and over 52,000 gas
meters, representing approximately 52,000 customers and a market share in the non-domestic gas sector of approximately
5.9 per cent. by meter count and 0.8 per cent. by volume of supply.

The Opus Group delivered approximately 3.9TWh of electricity to its customers in the year ended 31 March 2016.

The Opus Group currently procures the electricity it supplies to its customers from within the Group (although some
legacy transactions with third-party suppliers (from small renewable generators) remain to be delivered to the Opus Group in
the future), thereby creating an additional, credit efficient route to market for the electricity and ROCs generated in the
Generation segment. In the renewable power purchase agreement sector, the Opus Group offers one to three-year contracts to
generators to purchase electricity from them. These contracts are fixed-price for smaller generators or bespoke for larger
generators. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Opus Group procures the gas it supplies to its customers from
third-party suppliers outside of the Group; however, we intend to terminate these supply agreements in 2017 and source gas
from the wholesale gas market.

The Opus Group obtains the majority of its customers via a network of TPIs supported by its own customer services
department. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry—The Opus Acquisition may impact our


-----

_relationship with our existing providers, customers and TPIs_ _which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business,_
_operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our_
_Business and Industry—Following the Opus Acquisition, our reliance on TPIs has increased. Increased reliance on TPIs and_
_termination of relations with them might have an adverse impact on our reputation and operations.”_

The Opus Group offers business customers electricity and gas contracts on standard terms. In the SME sector, the Opus
Group offers gas and electricity contracts on a diverse price basis to suit its customers’ risk profile. The terms of these
products range from one to four years and are designed to pass on third-party charges to customers. In the I&C sector, the
Opus Group offers electricity on a fixed and flexible contract basis on terms of up to three years. Corporate gas customers are
offered fixed-price products only.

The Opus Group is based primarily in Northampton, where it owns an office building. It also has premises in Oxford
and has recently opened a new office in Cardiff. As of 31 December 2016, Opus Group had 866 employees.

_Billington Bioenergy_

In 2015, we acquired Billington Bioenergy. Billington Bioenergy is an intermediary in the UK retail market for wood
pellets, supplying several thousand business and domestic customers. Billington Bioenergy delivered approximately 32,000
tonnes of sustainable, certified wood pellets to customers throughout the UK in 2016 and 26,000 tonnes in 2015. Billington
Bioenergy’s customers use these wood pellets mainly for renewable heating.

Billington Bioenergy has an extended national depot infrastructure which is integrated with the Group’s access to port
facilities. Its headquarters are located in Liverpool, where Billington Bioenergy employed 24 employees as of 31 December
2016.

**Biomass Supply**

Our generation units that have been converted to burn only sustainable biomass. To support this demand, we currently
own and operate two wood pellet manufacturing facilities and a port export facility in the U.S. In 2016, our own pellet
facilities supplied approximately 560,000 tonnes or approximately 7.7 per cent. of our internal requirements for generation
from sustainable biomass. We intend to increase the share of sustainable biomass pellets sourced internally from our own
production facilities to at least 30 per cent. in the future. In 2016, we also sought to improve our cost profile through
productivity gains, carefully managed raw fibre costs and increased asset utilisation.

The U.S. operations principally seek to optimise supply chain and logistics operations of the Generation segment and
ensure the timely delivery of sustainable biomass fuel to the Power Station. The headquarters of the Biomass Supply segment
is located in Atlanta, Georgia and the operations are located primarily in the U.S. Gulf region, geographically close to both
large and growing sustainably managed forests and deep-water ports to optimise the transportation of both feedstock and
biomass pellets within the U.S. and ultimately across the Atlantic Ocean to the Power Station. We have recently announced
our successful bid to acquire our third wood pellet manufacturing facility in the southern states of the U.S. Our original two
pellet manufacturing facilities are located near Bastrop, Louisiana and Gloster, Mississippi, and have a combined annual
capacity of 900,000 tonnes, which we expect to increase through planned expansion to 1,050,000 tonnes by the end of 2017.
In addition, following the expected acquisition of a third wood pellet manufacturing facility located in Urania, Louisiana
(which we expect will complete by the end of April 2017) we expect to increase our combined annual capacity by a further
450,000 tonnes during 2018. The original plants were commissioned in 2015 and together produced 279,000 tonnes and
607,000 tonnes of pellets in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Wood pellets are produced from sustainably sourced biomass in the form of primary sources such as thinnings, tops
and harvesting residues sourced from the surrounding forests or secondary sources such as wood chips, shavings or sawdust
sourced from other wood-based manufacturing facilities. Both pellet manufacturing facilities have achieved certification
under the Sustainable Biomass Program, an industry standard demonstrating that biomass is legally and sustainably sourced.

Procurement of raw materials is the main driver of costs in our Biomass Supply segment. The fibre is sourced from a
range of suppliers local to the manufacturing facilities (“Fibre Basket”), with a range of contract tenors. The plants are sited
within Fibre Baskets with well-established commercial forestry operations, which principally service the construction and
manufacturing markets and provide a large amount of the lower value residue material typically used for sustainable wood
pellets.

Wood pellets are transported by road and rail from our manufacturing facilities to our own port export facility located
on the banks of the Mississippi river in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This export facility consists of port-side storage and loading
capabilities, on property leased from the Port of Greater Baton Rouge. The export facility includes two 40,000 tonne storage
domes, which can store pellets, arriving by road or rail, from our manufacturing facilities and from third-party suppliers. Our
storage and loading facility dispatched 11 ships to the UK in 2016 carrying approximately 558,000 tonnes of pellets,
including the first Panamax Vessel, which carried over 61,000 tonnes of pellets.

**Research and development**

Our research and development efforts are focused on the production, handling and burning of sustainable biomass. In
recent years, we have worked on the commercial development of sustainable biomass technology in large-scale industrial
coal plants, working towards safe and reliable production of electricity from sustainable biomass and the wider resource,
infrastructure and supply chain innovations that contribute to improved technology and reduced costs.

Since 2003, we have deepened our understanding of sustainable biomass combustion chemistry by investing significant
resources in scientific and technological research aimed at increasing the usable range of sustainable biomass fuels in
response to the prospective demand for such fuels. This has led to the innovative injection of pulverised fuel ash (which is a
by-product of coal combustion and therefore readily available) at a specific point in the combustion zone to reduce corrosion
in our boilers.

In August 2016, we established a new research and development team to specifically assess how new technology can
support the entire Group. This team has over 50 research and innovation streams in progress, with a focus on the following
three main areas: supporting Haven Power’s new strategy from a technology perspective; working on long-term options for
our remaining coal units; and looking at ways to reduce the cost of sustainable biomass fuel (or offset the current cost via
value adding additional products).

**Environment**

_Environmental performance of the Power Station_

We strive towards reducing our impact on the environment and regard compliance with legislative and regulatory
requirements as the minimum level of achievement. Fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions from the Power Station fell from
22.7 million tonnes in 2012 to 6.0 million tonnes in 2016.

EU environmental legislation, notably the IED, imposes limits on, among other things, emissions of SO2 and NOx from
our generation units.

Effective January 2016, the IED sets an annual limit on the amount of NOx and SO2 that we can emit from the Power
Station. We must either ensure that our coal and biomass units operate within this limit or else purchase additional emissions
allowances from other generators equal to the shortfall.

The Power Station is also subject to short-term (24-hourly and monthly) emission limit values for SO2, NOx and
particulate matter. These limits reflect achievable emissions rates from plants such as the Power Station, and the Power
Station remains compliant with them.

The FGD system is designed to remove approximately 90 per cent. of SO2 emissions, enabling the Power Station to
operate within the SO2 emissions restrictions of the IED and to efficiently burn a mixture of fuels including coal, sustainable
biomass and petroleum coke, including in a manner that satisfies environmental requirements. NOx emissions are reduced
further through the boosted over-fire air technology that is fitted on the boilers, allowing the Power Station to operate within
the NOx restrictions of the IED. In addition, five of the Power Station’s six generation units have been fitted with selective
non-catalytic reduction technology. The installation of this new equipment, together with the increased use of sustainable
biomass and low-NOx coal as well as lower electricity output, contributed to a 53 per cent. reduction in NOx emissions from
the Power Station in 2016 compared to 2015.

By-products of the coal-combustion and FGD operations such as ash and gypsum are sold to the construction industry,
which both reduces disposal costs and creates revenue. Ash can also be used as mitigant to be fed into the Power Station’s
boilers along with biomass to reduce corrosion and slagging.

For further information, see “Industry Overview—Electricity Market: regulatory context—Capacity constraints”.


-----

_Environmental performance and compliance_

During 2016 we completed our plan to become a predominantly sustainable biomass-fuelled generator. In particular,
we converted our third generation unit to burn sustainable biomass in December 2016. Through increasing the amount of
sustainable biomass burnt in place of coal we are significantly reducing our carbon footprint.

We are required to disclose emissions from biologically sequestered carbon, which includes emissions released through
burning sustainable biomass to generate electricity. Through the strategy to become a predominantly sustainable biomassfuelled generator, there will be a rise in biologically sequestered carbon emissions.

Environmental compliance at the Power Station and associated landfill site is managed through an environmental
management system that is externally certified to the international standard ISO 14001 2015. It is audited twice every year.
There have been no material breaches of our environmental consents in the last three years.

**Health and safety**

We are committed to ensuring a safe working environment. In 2016, our safety statistics demonstrated good
performance over approximately five million hours worked with a 0.02 lost time injury rate (lost time injuries / hours worked
x 100,000), an improvement from the 2015 rate, and a consistent 0.22 total recordable injury rate ((lost time injuries + worse
than first aid injuries) / hours worked x 100,000), an improvement from the 2015 rate.

We retained our certification for the Health and Safety Management System to the internationally recognised
Occupational Health and Safety Standard, OHSAS 18001, at the Power Station. The standard is approved by Lloyd’s
Register Quality Assurance. Our U.S. operations are managed through integrated management systems ISO 9000 and 14000
to ensure employees operate in a safe working environment.

In addition, the Power Station was awarded the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents Gold Medal Award for
the 13th consecutive year. In 2016, we achieved the President’s Award for outstanding performance in health and safety at
work.

Safety performance is reported and reviewed regularly by local management teams, the Drax Group plc executive
committee and the Board. Each incident is comprehensively analysed and reviewed, lessons learnt are shared with the
employees and actions are taken to mitigate against future occurrences.

**Insurance**

We have in place insurance policies with major insurance companies covering items such as property damage and
business interruption, third-party liability, credit risk (at Opus only), terrorism, marine cargo, charterers and other financial
risks such as commercial crime and pension trustee liability. These insurance policies are maintained at a level that we
believe is reasonable. Other than as described below, we have not experienced any losses under our insurance policies due to
any significant supply event, interruption to our business or damage to our facilities due to fire, explosion or other causes. We
currently have a claim under our business interruption insurance for lost revenue arising from reduced generation due to a
longer than anticipated planned outage of one of our biomass generation units and other unplanned outages reducing the
availability of the Power Station’s biomass generation units in the second half of 2016. These policies are with major
insurance companies.


-----

**Employees**

As of 31 December 2016, we employed 1,488 people, an increase of approximately 2.5 per cent. compared to the
previous year, and Opus Group employed 866 people. Most of the workforce is employed full time on permanent contracts.
The number of employees by business unit as at 31 December 2016 are shown below:

**Group Employees as at 31 December 2016**

Approximately 23 per cent. of our employees (including Opus Group) are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
For the remainder, we have representative employee consultation and information arrangements in place.

**Licences**

Our UK operating companies hold a number of licences issued by Ofgem relating to their activities in the UK energy
sector, most notably:

Drax Power holds a generation licence in respect of its generation from the Power Station. This licence contains,
amongst other things, provisions relating to compliance with the grid code, the balancing and settlement code and other
industry codes and a requirement to offer terms for the provision of Ancillary Services when requested to do so by the
System Operator (albeit with no requirement to offer services at a price which is uneconomical).

Both companies in our Retail segment hold supply licences for the supply of electricity to their customers. These
licences contain, amongst other things, provisions relating to the continuity of supply, compliance with industry codes and
customer relations, including the provision of certain information to customers and a general duty to treat certain of their
customers fairly.

The Opus Group holds a supply licence for the supply of gas to its customers. This licence contains, amongst other
things, provisions relating to the continuity of supply, compliance with industry codes and the provision of certain
information to customers.

**Competition**

For competitive conditions with respect to our business, see “Industry Overview—The Big Six”.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are routinely involved in a number of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business involving employment,
commercial, intellectual property, environmental, and personal injuries and damages issues, among other matters. We are
currently not involved in any legal or administrative proceeding which we believe would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of the material terms of certain financing arrangements to which certain members of the_
_Group are a party does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the_
_underlying documents. For further information regarding our existing indebtedness, see “Use of Proceeds”,_
_“Capitalisation” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Opus”._

_Capitalised terms used in this section that are not otherwise defined in “Definitions” or “Business and Industry_
_Glossary” shall have the meanings assigned to them in this section._

Certain members of the Group have entered into financing arrangements which are summarised below.

**New Senior Facilities Agreement**

We entered into a revolving credit facility agreement on 20 December 2012 between, among others, Drax Power,
Barclays Bank PLC as facility agent and Drax Corporate Limited which was amended and restated on 8 December 2015 and
which will be, subject to customary conditions precedent, amended and restated pursuant to an amendment and restatement
agreement (the “A&R Agreement”) on or about the Issue Date (as amended and restated, the “New Senior Facilities
**Agreement”). The New Senior Facilities Agreement will comprise a £315 million committed multicurrency working capital**
and ancillary facility, including, without limitation, a letter of credit facility (the “New Revolving Facility”) and a
£35 million term facility (the “New Term Loan”). The New Revolving Facility can be drawn in sterling, euros or U.S.
dollars. The New Term Loan will be fully drawn on the Issue Date.

The original borrower under the New Senior Facilities Agreement is Drax Corporate Limited. The New Senior
Facilities Agreement provides for the flexibility of acceding (and subsequently resigning) subsidiaries of DGHL incorporated
in the UK or in the U.S. (subject to certain customary conditions) as additional borrowers.

**_Purpose_**

Each loan under the New Revolving Facility may be used (i) to provide cash collateral in favour of certain permitted
counterparties; (ii) to provide cash cover in favour of an issuing bank of a letter of credit or in respect of an ancillary facility
under the New Senior Facilities Agreement; and (iii) for the other general corporate purposes of the Group, including, but not
limited to, financing working capital requirements. There is a separate sub-limit of £200 million on cash drawings for general
corporate purposes under limb (iii) above.

**_Interest and fees_**

Interest is payable under the New Revolving Facility at a rate of LIBOR, or in the case of loans in euro, EURIBOR (in
each case subject to a zero floor) plus the applicable margin. Save for in circumstances where an event of default has
occurred and is continuing or the borrower has failed to notify the facility agent of a change in rating, the applicable margin is
determined by reference to a ratings matrix, ranging from a maximum of 2.75 per cent. where the rating of the debt incurred
under the New Revolving Facility is BB-/Ba3 or lower to a minimum of 1.25 per cent. where such rating is BBB/Baa2 or
higher.

A commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrear on the available but unused commitments under the New Revolving
Facility at a rate of 35 per cent. of the applicable margin. A utilisation fee is payable quarterly in arrear at a rate of (i) 0.20 per
cent. per annum for each day on which the aggregate amount of the utilised commitments under the New Revolving Facility
exceeds 50 per cent. of the total commitments under the New Revolving Facility; or 0.40 per cent. per annum for each day on
which the aggregate amount of the utilised commitments under the New Revolving Facility exceeds 75 per cent. of the total
commitments under the New Revolving Facility.

Interest is payable under the New Term Loan at a rate calculated by multiplying a fixed rate of 4.158 per cent. per
annum by the index ratio applicable to the relevant interest payment date multiplied by the outstanding principal amount of
the New Term Loan. The relevant index for calculation of the index ratio is the Non-revised Retail Price Index All Items in
the United Kingdom as published by the Office of National Statistics.

**_Availability and maturity_**

The New Revolving Facility is available to be drawn until one month prior to the final maturity date and letters of
credit may be issued up until the final maturity date (in each case, as such may be extended). The New Revolving Facility has
an initial maturity date of 30 April 2021, with an option to extend to 30 April 2022. The New Term Loan has a maturity date
of 31 March 2022.

The New Revolving Facility may be utilised by way of letter of credit, reducing the amount available for cash drawings
under the New Revolving Facility by an amount equivalent to the letters of credit issued.


-----

**_Prepayment_**

The New Senior Facilities Agreement contains customary provisions for the prepayment and cancellation of a
particular lender’s commitments in the case of a defaulting lender, additional payments being charged for tax reasons or
increased costs.

Subject to certain conditions, the borrowers under the New Revolving Facility may voluntarily prepay their utilisations
or permanently cancel all or part of the available commitments under the New Revolving Facility. Amounts voluntarily
prepaid may be re-borrowed during the availability period applicable to the New Revolving Facility. Subject to certain
conditions, the borrower of the New Term Loan may voluntarily prepay all or part of the New Term Loan at an amount equal
to the principal amount so prepaid multiplied by the index ratio as at the relevant prepayment date, plus a make-whole
amount (as described below).

Subject to certain thresholds and other qualifications, there are mandatory prepayments required to be made in respect
of the New Senior Facilities upon the occurrence of certain events such as change of control, illegality and sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Group. The New Senior Facilities Agreement also contains provisions for mandatory
prepayment on the occurrence of a Note Purchase Condition, as described below. There is also a mandatory prepayment
required to be made in respect of the New Term Loan in the event that the applicable index ceases to be published and no
appropriate successor index can be determined. The applicable make-whole amount, as described further below, is payable in
respect of prepayments under the New Term Loan.

The New Senior Facilities Agreement provides that no members of the Group may repay, purchase, defease or redeem
(or otherwise retire for value) any of the Notes using the proceeds of an Asset Disposition unless:

     - either:

 the aggregate principal amount of all Notes prepaid, purchased, defeased, redeemed (or otherwise
retired for value) or acquired since the Issue Date is less than or equal to 50% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes issued as of the Issue Date; or

 to the extent that members of the Group make prepayments, purchases, defeasances, redemptions
(or other retirements for value) or acquisitions that in the aggregate exceed 50% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes issued as of the Issue Date, the Group is obligated to match the
prepayment, purchase, defeasance, redemption (or other retirement for value) by a simultaneous
cancellation and, if necessary, repayment of an equal amount under the New Senior Facilities Agreement
in order that the total commitments under the New Senior Facilities Agreement are reduced by the same
proportion as the debt so repurchased relative to aggregate principal amount of Notes issued as of the
Issue Date; and

    - no default continuing or resulting from the prepayment, purchase, defeasance, redemption (or other retirement for
value).

The applicable make-whole amount in respect of prepayments under the New Term Loan is calculated by reference to
the excess, if any, of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest under the New Term
Loan with respect to the principal amount prepaid, over the amount of such principal prepaid. The applicable discount factor
is calculated by reference to the applicable percentage (which is determined by reference to the nature of the relevant
prepayment) plus the yield to maturity of the specified reference gilt.

**_Undertakings and covenants_**

The New Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain negative undertakings that are substantially similar to those in
the Indenture governing the Notes. The New Senior Facilities Agreement will also contain customary negative covenants,
subject to certain agreed exceptions, including, but not limited to, (i) restrictions on change of business, (ii) centre of main
interests, (iii) share capital, (iv) purchase or redemption of the Notes, (v) activities of DGHL, (vi) incurrence of certain
indebtedness by non-obligor subsidiaries, (vii) certain disposals of assets to non-obligor subsidiaries, (viii) change to Drax
Group plc’s year end, and (ix) parameters of the Secured Trade Line. The New Senior Facilities Agreement also requires
each obligor to observe certain affirmative undertakings subject to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions.

These affirmative undertakings include, but are not limited to, undertakings related to (i) compliance with relevant
laws, rules and regulations (including environmental, sanctions and anti-corruption), (ii) payment of taxes, (iii) the delivery
of certain financial statements, (iv) information reporting obligations in respect of the Secured Trading Line, (v) rating, (vi)
notice of default and material litigation, (vii) right to request information relating to our financial condition, (viii) insurance,
(ix) maintenance of assets and (x) compliance with and maintenance of material authorisations. There is also an affirmative
undertaking in relation to guarantor coverage (by reference to 85 per cent. of consolidated EBITDA and our consolidated
total assets), subject to certain exceptions.


-----

The New Senior Facilities Agreement will also require us to ensure compliance with a financial covenant requiring our
consolidated EBITDA for the prior 12 month period to be no less than £170 million as at any applicable semi-annual testing
date. This covenant will be tested only where either: (i) drawings of cash within the £200 million sub-limit on cash drawings
for general corporate purposes described above are 25 per cent. or more of the total commitments as at the relevant semiannual testing date; or (ii) any New Term Loan is outstanding.

**_Events of default_**

The New Senior Facilities Agreement contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed
thresholds, grace periods and qualifications), including non-payment, breach of other obligations, misrepresentation, crossdefault, insolvency, insolvency proceedings, creditors’ process, cessation of business, effectiveness of finance documents,
ownership of obligors and proceedings. In addition to these customary events of default, the New Senior Facilities
Agreement contains events of default reflective of the nature of our business, relating to the generation licence granted to
Drax Power pursuant to the Electricity Act 1989, nationalisation, and the Secured Trading Line. At any time after the
occurrence of an event of default, the facility agent may, and on the instruction of majority lenders must, cancel all or any
part of the total commitments and/or declare that amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable and/or payable on
demand. In addition, after the occurrence of an event of default following a breach of the financial covenant described above,
the lenders under the New Term Loan and the majority lenders under the New Revolving Facility each have a separate right
(in respect of the New Term Loan and the New Revolving Facility, respectively) to cancel all or any part of the commitments
and/or declare that amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable and/or payable on demand.

**_Security, guarantee and indemnity_**

It is intended that the New Senior Facilities will be secured by the same Collateral as for the Notes as set out under
“Description of Notes—Security.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds from any distressed disposal and from any enforcement
of the Collateral will be applied to repayment of the New Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations (including our
obligations under the Secured Trading Line in priority to repayment of the Notes.

The provision and the terms of the Collateral will in all cases be subject to certain limitations and are at all times and in
all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters set out in the New Senior Facilities Agreement.
Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and our Capital Structure—Each Guarantee and
_security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to_
_certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

The New Senior Facilities will be guaranteed by the Guarantors (other than Drax Corporate Limited) and the Issuer.
Each guarantor under the New Senior Facilities Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

    - guarantees to each finance party punctual performance by each other obligor of all that obligor’s obligations under
the New Senior Facilities Agreement;

    - undertakes with each finance party that whenever another obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in
connection with any finance document relating to the New Senior Facilities Agreement, that Guarantor shall
immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and

    - indemnifies each finance party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability suffered by that finance
party if any amount claimed by a finance party under the guarantee is not recoverable from the guarantor on the
basis of the guarantee. The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the amount which that finance party
would otherwise have been entitled to recover.

**_Governing law_**

The New Senior Facilities Agreement is governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with English law,
although the incurrence covenants contained therein, which largely replicate the relevant covenants from the Notes, shall be
interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.


-----

**_Agreed Security Principles_**

The Agreed Security Principles embody recognition by all parties to the New Senior Facilities Agreement that there
may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining security and guarantees from all the guarantors under the New
Senior Facilities Agreement in every jurisdiction in which such guarantors are incorporated. The Agreed Security Principles
provide that guarantees will not be given and security shall not be granted in certain circumstances, in particular to the extent
that:

    - it would result in a breach of general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, “thin capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”, transfer pricing, capital
maintenance, retention of title claims and similar principles, laws or regulations;

    - it would result in costs (including tax disadvantages) to the Group that would be disproportionate to the benefit
accruing to the secured parties;

    - the relevant assets are subject to third-party arrangements which prevent those assets from being charged or would
give a third-party termination or other rights in respect of arrangements relating to those assets; or

    - it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant member of the Group or would conflict with any relevant fiduciary
duties or contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition.

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when determining the extent of
the guarantees and the security to be provided and certain additional principles which will be reflected in any security taken.

**Secured Trading Line and Hedging**

Drax Power has entered into ISDA agreements (the “STL Master Agreements”) with a number of financial
institutions (the “STL Counterparties”), under which Drax Power can trade UK power, dark green spreads and gas on a
senior secured basis without the requirement for Drax Power to post collateral (the “Secured Trading Line”). Certain
minimum rating requirements are imposed on the STL Counterparties under the ISDA agreements, and STL Counterparties
that fail to meet such requirements shall post collateral to Drax Power to the extent of any exposure Drax Power faces on
transactions with that STL Counterparty.

The tradable volumes and maximum exposure permitted under the Secured Trading Line are set on a seasonal basis,
based upon parameters set out in the New Senior Facilities Agreement. Trading is limited at any time to five consecutive sixmonthly seasons, commencing with winter 2017/18 and subject to extension by Drax Power at its discretion at the end of
each season, within the parameters of the New Senior Facilities Agreement. Under the terms of the New Senior Facilities
Agreement, the potential future exposure under the Secured Trading Line for each combination of tradable products must be
less than £200 million as determined on a seasonal basis, with the maximum seasonal trading volume being up to 600MW (or
equivalent). The £200 million cap, for each combination of tradable products, remains in effect to control the voting rights of
the STL Counterparties only, and does not limit their super senior secured claims under the STL, which will be determined in
accordance with the terms of the underlying STL documents and which are uncapped.

Potential future exposure under the Secured Trading Line is calculated on the basis of the net aggregate mark-to-market
exposure of all transactions entered into under the Secured Trading Line and the net aggregate forecast mark-to-market
exposure as if the maximum seasonal trading volume were to be traded for each of the relevant seasons. However, the actual
day to day level of exposure will fluctuate and may cross the £200 million threshold should the forecast exposure fall short of
actual levels.

The STL Counterparties’ right to terminate all or any part of a transaction entered into with Drax Power under the
relevant STL Master Agreement is prescribed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the New Senior Facilities Agreement.
These extend beyond the usual termination rights under an ISDA agreement, for instance the right to terminate if Drax Power
enters into a transaction under the STL Master Agreement which results in the maximum seasonal trading volume threshold
being exceeded.

The STL Counterparties will benefit from the same Collateral as the Notes, the New Senior Facilities Loan as referred
to above and set out under “Description of Notes—Security”.

In addition, we have outstanding currency rate hedging arrangements and have the ability to enter into additional
currency, interest rate and inflation rate hedging arrangements on a secured basis, with the Hedge Counterparties also
benefiting from the same Collateral as referred to above.

These arrangements are in addition to any commodities and/or currency and interest rate trading that we undertake on
an unsecured and/or title transfer collateral basis.

**Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Opus Revolving Credit Facility_**

Pursuant to a credit agreement dated 1 July 2014 (as most recently amended and restated on 16 March 2017) between,
among others, Opus Energy Limited (as borrower and guarantor), Opus and certain members of the Opus Group (each as
guarantors of the obligors’ obligations under the credit agreement), Barclays Bank PLC and HSBC Bank plc (as lenders and
arrangers) and Barclays Bank PLC (as agent) (the “Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement”), the lenders have made
available a £35 million revolving credit facility (the “Opus **Revolving Credit Facility”). As at 31 March 2017, there was**
£2 million outstanding under the Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Each loan under the Opus Revolving Credit
Facility may be applied towards the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Opus Group.

**_Interest and fees_**

Interest is payable under the Opus Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of LIBOR plus the applicable margin. A
commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrear on the available but unused commitments under the Opus Revolving Credit
Facility at a rate of 0.70 per cent. of each lender’s available commitment.

**_Availability and maturity_**

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility is available to be drawn until one week prior to the termination date. The Opus
Revolving Credit Facility currently has a termination date of 15 December 2017.

**_Prepayment_**

Subject to certain thresholds and other qualifications, there are mandatory prepayments required to be made in respect
of the Opus Revolving Credit Facility upon the occurrence of certain events, such as change of control, illegality and sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Opus Group.

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary provisions for the prepayment and cancellation of a
particular lender’s commitments in the case of additional payments being charged for tax reasons or increased costs.

**_Undertakings and covenants_**

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain negative undertakings that are customary for debt
facilities of this nature, subject to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions. These include, but are not limited
to, restrictions on (i) mergers, (ii) change of business, (iii) change to centre of main interest, (iv) acquisitions, (v) joint
ventures, (vi) creation of security interests, (vii) disposals, (viii) loans, (ix) guarantees or indemnities, (x) financial
indebtedness, (xi) issuance or redemption of share capital, and (xii) treasury transactions.

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires each obligor to observe certain affirmative undertakings
subject to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions. These affirmative undertakings include, but are not limited
to, undertakings related to (i) compliance with relevant laws, rules and regulations (including environmental, sanctions and
anti-corruption), (ii) payment of taxes, (iii) the delivery of certain financial statements, (iv) notice of default and material
litigation, (v) right to request information relating to the financial condition of the Opus Group, (vi) insurance, (vii)
maintenance of assets, (viii) maintenance of pension schemes and (ix) compliance with and maintenance of material
authorisations. There is also an affirmative undertaking in relation to guarantor coverage (by reference to 90 per cent. of
aggregate EBITDA, aggregate total assets and aggregate turnover of the Opus Group)), subject to certain exceptions.

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Opus Group to ensure compliance with certain
financial covenants in respect of leverage (measuring the total net debt of the Opus Group against its EBITDA), interest
cover (measuring the EBITDA of the Opus Group against its net financing charges) and minimum consolidated tangible net
assets (requiring the consolidated tangible net assets of the Opus Group to meet certain thresholds). The financial covenants
are each tested semi-annually on a 12-month look-back basis.

**_Events of default_**

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed
thresholds, grace periods and qualifications), including non-payment, breach of other obligations, misrepresentation, crossdefault, insolvency, insolvency proceedings, creditors’ process, cessation of business, repudiation of finance documents,
ownership of obligors and material adverse change. In addition to these customary events of default, the Opus Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement contains events of default reflective of the nature of the Opus Group’s business, relating to
commitments under supply agreements, and obligations in respect of renewables obligations under the Electricity Act 1989
and the climate change levy created by the Finance Act 2000. At any time after the occurrence of an event of default, the
facility agent may, and on the instruction of majority lenders must, cancel all or any part of the total commitments and/or
declare that amounts outstanding are immediately due and payable and/or payable on demand.


-----

**_Guarantee and indemnity_**

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility is unsecured.

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain members of the Opus Group. Pursuant to a deed dated
15 March 2017, DGHL has granted a guarantee in favour of Barclays Bank PLC (as security agent for, inter alia, the lenders
under the Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) as security for the obligations of the obligors under the Opus
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

DGHL and each member of the Opus Group which is a guarantor under the Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

    - guarantees to each finance party punctual performance by each other obligor of all that obligor’s obligations under
the Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement;

    - undertakes with each finance party that whenever another obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in
connection with any finance document relating to the Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, that Guarantor
shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and

    - indemnifies each finance party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability suffered by that finance
party if any obligation guaranteed by it pursuant to the Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is or becomes
unenforceable, invalid or illegal. The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the amount which that
finance party would otherwise have been entitled to recover.

**_Governing law_**

The Opus Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection
with it are governed by English law.

**Drax Biomass Inc. Uncommitted Line of Credit**

Pursuant to an uncommitted line of credit agreement dated 7 April 2017, Bank of America N.A. made available a
US$25 million uncommitted line of credit to Drax Biomass Inc. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the
uncommitted line of credit was undrawn. Proceeds of any loans under the uncommitted line of credit are to be used for
general working capital purposes.

Interest is payable on loans under the uncommitted line of credit at a rate per annum initially equal to the applicable
LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The interest rate is subject to change at the lender’s sole discretion at any time. The
uncommitted line of credit matures on 7 April 2018 and may be terminated early in the case of a payment default by, or
insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding being filed by or against, Drax Biomass Inc. The uncommitted line of credit is
supported by a comfort letter from Drax Group plc.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

In connection with the issuance of the Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes”) and the entering into the New Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Issuer, the Guarantors and certain other subsidiaries of the Issuer will enter into an intercreditor
agreement on or around the Issue Date to govern the relationships and relative priorities among: (i) Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch acting as security agent for the secured parties (the “Security Agent”); (ii) Barclays Bank plc acting as agent
under the New Senior Facilities Agreement (the “Original Credit Facility Agent”); (iii) the lenders under the New Senior
Facilities Agreement (the “Original Lenders”); (iv) the Trustee, on its behalf and on behalf of the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Noteholders”) (the “Senior Secured Notes Trustee”); (v) the counterparties to certain
hedging arrangements (the “Hedging Agreements”), such persons being referred to in such capacity as the “Hedge
**Counterparties”); (vi) the counterparties to certain Secured Trading Line arrangements (the “STL Agreements”), such**
persons being referred to in such capacity as the “STL Counterparties”; (vii) Intra-Group creditors and debtors; (viii) Drax
Group plc (the “Parent”) and the Group; and (ix) those persons who accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance
with its terms.

DGHL and each of its subsidiaries that incurs liabilities above a prescribed limit or provides any guarantee under the
New Senior Facilities Agreement or the Indenture are each referred to in this description as a “Debtor” and are referred to
collectively as the “Debtors”.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out:

    - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

    - the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;


-----

    - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

    - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

    - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency
events;

    - provisions in respect of control of the enforcement process (if undertaken);

    - turnover provisions; and

    - when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of any assets subject to transaction security (the
“Collateral”).

For the purposes of this section only:

    - the New Senior Facilities Agreement and “Credit Facility” means, on or prior to the later of the date on which
(i) the New Senior Facilities Agreement and (ii) any additional credit facility (an “Additional Credit Facility”) not
prohibited under the Indenture and entered into with the consent of the Original Lenders, is discharged (the
“Original Lender Discharge Date”), the New Senior Facilities Agreement and any Additional Credit Facility, and
thereafter, any credit facility as permitted under the Pari Passu Debt Documents (as defined below);

    - the “Group” means Drax Group Holdings Limited (“DGHL”) and its Restricted Subsidiaries; and

    - “Creditor Representative” means:

 in relation to certain of the Original Lenders, the Original Credit Facility Agent;

 in relation to the Credit Facility lenders under any other Credit Facility, the facility agent (or
equivalent) in respect of that Credit Facility;

 in relation to the Senior Secured Noteholders, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee; and

 in relation to any other Pari Passu Creditors (as defined below), the entity that accedes to the
Intercreditor Agreement as the “Creditor Representative” of such Pari Passu Creditors.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred by the Issuer and
the Guarantors that is permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Hedging Agreements, the STL Agreements, any Finance
Document under and as described in the Credit Facility Agreement (the “Credit Facility Documents”), the Pari Passu Debt
Documents (as defined below), the Security Documents (as defined below) and any agreement evidencing the terms of any
Parent Liabilities (as defined below) or Intra-Group Liabilities as well as any document designated as such by the applicable
Security Agent and DGHL (together, the “Debt Documents”) that are not subordinated in right of payment to any Super
Senior Liabilities (as defined below) or the Pari Passu Liabilities (as defined below), to be secured by the Collateral, subject
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Such future indebtedness may be incurred pursuant to an indenture or a facility agreement, and with the Senior Secured
Indenture are referred to as “Pari Passu Debt Agreements”. Each document required to implement the issuance of Senior
Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Note Documents”) and such future indebtedness (together with the Senior Secured
Note Documents, the “Pari Passu Debt Documents”) evidence the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the holders of the
Senior Secured Noteholders (the “Senior Secured Note Liabilities”) and creditors (together with the Senior Secured
Noteholders, the “Pari Passu Creditors”) under such future indebtedness (together with the Senior Secured Note Liabilities,
the “Pari Passu Liabilities”).

The liabilities owed by the Debtors to creditors under the Super Senior Documents (as defined below) are referred to as
the “Super Senior Liabilities”, and the creditors under those documents are referred to as the “Super Senior Creditors”.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions empowering the Security Agent to appoint a delegate or co-security
agent to perform its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
override anything in the Credit Facility Documents, the Hedging Agreements and STL Agreements (together, the “Super
**Senior Documents”) or the Pari Passu Debt Documents. By accepting a Senior Secured Note, holders of the Senior Secured**
Notes shall be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement and to have
authorised the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on their behalf.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.
It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety, and we urge you to read that document because it, and not the
description that follows, defines your rights as holders of the Senior Secured Notes.


-----

**_Ranking and Priority_**

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities owed by Debtors to the Super Senior Creditors and
the Pari Passu Creditors (the “Primary Creditors”) shall rank in right and priority of payment pari passu and without any
preference between them. The liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Parent or intra-Group shall be postponed and
subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors. The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to
rank any of the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Parent or intra-Group as between themselves. Subject to the order of
payment set out in “—Application of Proceeds”, nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement prevents payment by the Parent or
any Debtor of fees, costs and expenses payable to Creditor Representatives (the “Creditor Representative Amounts”).

**_Transaction Security_**

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement will agree in the Intercreditor Agreement that the security provided by the
Debtors and the Parent for the Super Senior Liabilities and the Pari Passu Liabilities (the “Transaction Security”) will,
subject to the order of payment set out under “—Application of Proceeds”, rank and secure all such liabilities pari passu and
without any preference between them. The Transaction Security will be subject to customary limitations on security as set out
under “—Agreed Security Principles”.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Debt
Document or in connection with the realisation or enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security shall be held by
the Security Agent on trust and applied in the following order of priority:

(a) in discharging any sums owed to the Security Agent, any receiver or delegate and in payment of the Creditor
Representative Amounts to the Creditor Representatives;

(b) in discharging all costs and expenses incurred by any Primary Creditor in connection with any realisation or
enforcement of the Transaction Security taken in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or
any action taken at the request of the Security Agent;

(c) in payment or distribution to:

(i) each Creditor Representative in respect of any liabilities owed by any Debtor under the Credit
Facility Documents (the “Credit Facility Liabilities”);

(ii) the Hedge Counterparties in respect of any liabilities owed by any Debtor under the Hedging
Agreements (the “Hedging Liabilities”); and

(iii) the STL Counterparties in respect of any liabilities owed by any Debtor under the STL Agreements
(the “STL Liabilities”),

for application towards the discharge of:

(iv) the Credit Facility Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility Documents) on a
_pro rata basis between the Credit Facility Liabilities incurred under separate Credit Facility_
Agreements;

(v) the Hedging Liabilities (on a pro rata basis between the Hedging Liabilities of each Hedge
Counterparty); and

(vi) the STL Liabilities (on a pro rata basis between the STL Liabilities of each STL Counterparty),

on a pro rata basis between paragraph (A), paragraph (B) and paragraph (C) above;

(d) in payment or distribution to the Creditor Representatives in respect of any Pari Passu Liabilities on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Pari Passu Creditors for which it is the Creditor Representative for application
towards the discharge of:

(i) the Pari Passu Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents)
on a pro rata basis between Pari Passu Liabilities under separate Pari Passu Facility Agreements; and

(ii) the Pari Passu Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents)
on a pro rata basis between Pari Passu Liabilities under separate Pari Passu Note Indentures,

on a pro rata basis between paragraph (i) and paragraph (ii) above;

(e) if none of the Debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any Super Senior Document or
Pari Passu Debt Document, in payment or distribution to any person to whom the Security Agent is obliged to
pay or distribute in priority to any Debtor; and


-----

(f) the balance, if any, in payment or distribution to the relevant Debtor or other person entitled to it (which other
person shall include the trustees of the Drax Pension Scheme where required pursuant to the Pension Trustee
Priority Deed).

**_Permitted payments_**

_Permitted Payments: Credit Facility Liabilities and Pari Passu Debt Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement permits the Debtors to make payments in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities and the
Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (which includes the Senior Secured Note Liabilities) at any time in accordance with the terms of
the relevant Debt Documents if at the time of payment no acceleration event has occurred, at which point payments may only
be made from the proceeds of enforcement in the order of payment set out in “—Application of Proceeds” other than any
distribution or dividend out of any Debtor’s unsecured asset (pro rata to each unsecured creditor’s claim) made by a
liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer appointed in respect
of any Debtor or any of its assets.

_Permitted Payments: Hedging Liabilities_

(a) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Credit
**Facility Lender Discharge Date”), the Debtors may not pay, and no Hedge Counterparty may receive and**
retain payment of, any amount under a Hedging Agreement unless the payment is due and payable under that
Hedging Agreement and made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. On or following an
acceleration event, if any amount (following application of payment netting, close-out netting and crossaffiliate netting) falls due from a Hedge Counterparty to any Debtor under the Hedging Agreements, that
amount shall be paid to the Security Agent and applied in accordance as set out in “—Application of
_Proceeds”. Following the occurrence of an acceleration event, no member of the Group may make payments_
of the Hedging Liabilities except from enforcement proceeds distributed as set out in “—Application of
_Proceeds” other than any distribution or dividend out of any Debtor’s unsecured asset (pro rata to each_
unsecured creditor’s claim) made by a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory
manager or other similar officer appointed in respect of any Debtor or any of its assets. The Intercreditor
Agreement prevents the Hedge Counterparties and the Debtors, prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge
Date, terminating or closing out any part of any hedging transaction prior to its originally stated maturity date
unless it is able to do so under the relevant Hedging Agreement or with the agreement of the other party
thereto and:

(i) (Non-payment) the termination or close-out is by a Hedge Counterparty in circumstances where any
Hedging Liabilities have not been paid to that Hedge Counterparty on the due date for payment
under that Hedging Agreement and the non-payment has not been remedied or waived (x) within 10
business days after the Hedge Counterparty gave notice of the non-payment in writing to the Security
Agent and the Debtor which failed to make the payment, and (y) by the time of such termination or
close-out;

(ii) (Overhedging) the net aggregate amount of notional amounts of any interest rate Hedging
Transactions is in respect of any secured obligations exceeds 100 per cent. of the principal amount of
all loans, notes, bonds or other similar debt instruments (other than drawings by way of “Letters of
Credit” as defined in the Credit Facility Agreement (in each case which carries a floating rate of
interest) outstanding in respect of that Secured Obligation (such excess, the “Overhedged
**Amount”), in which case:**

(A) the relevant Debtor may terminate all or any part of the relevant Overhedged Amount; and

(B) a Hedge Counterparty may terminate such proportion of the Overhedged Amount (not
otherwise terminated pursuant to paragraph (A) above within three business days of the
Hedge Counterparty giving notice to the relevant Debtor of its intention to terminate pursuant
to this paragraph (B)) as the net aggregate of notional amounts of its interest rate Hedging
Transactions in respect of that Secured Obligation bears to the net aggregate of the notional
amounts of all interest rate Hedging Transactions in respect of that Secured Obligation;

(iii) (Refinancing) the termination or close-out occurs on or immediately following a refinancing (or
repayment) and cancellation in full of any Credit Facility Liabilities or Pari Passu Liabilities.

(iv) (Net Receipt by a Debtor) subject to compliance by the Debtors with their obligations (if any)
relating to hedging transactions in the Credit Facility Documents, if the termination or close-out of
such hedging transaction (or such part thereof) is by a Debtor and would result in a net termination or
close-out amount in respect of such termination or close-out being payable to the relevant Debtor;


-----

(v) (Other termination by a Debtor) subject to compliance by the relevant Debtor with its obligations (if
any) relating to hedging transactions under the Credit Facility Documents, the termination or closeout is by a Debtor and:

(A) an event of default (however described) has occurred and is continuing in respect of the
Hedge Counterparty (or the Hedge Counterparty’s “Credit Support Provider” (as defined in
the relevant Hedging Agreement), if any) under the relevant Hedging Agreement;

(B) an Additional Termination Event (as defined in the relevant Hedging Agreement) has
occurred and is continuing as a result of the relevant Hedge Counterparty failing to procure
the provision of a guarantee, collateral or other credit support document in accordance with
the terms of the relevant Hedging Agreement; or

(C) is made with the consent of the relevant Hedge Counterparty;

(vi) (Following a Distress Event) if a Distress Event has occurred;

(vii) (Following certain Termination Events) if the payment arises from a termination or close-out in
respect of an Affected Transaction (as defined the relevant Hedging Agreement) as a result of force
majeure with respect to that hedging transaction, such as an Illegality, Tax Event, Tax Event Upon
Merger or Force Majeure Event (each as defined in the relevant Hedging Agreement);

(viii) (Bankruptcy) if the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a result of a close-out
or termination instituted by the Hedge Counterparty and an event of default has occurred and is
continuing under the relevant Hedging Agreement as a result of an event or circumstance described
in:

(A) section 5(a)(vii) (Bankruptcy) of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (if the relevant Hedging
Agreement is based on a 1992 ISDA Master Agreement);

(B) section 5(a)(vii) (Bankruptcy) of the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (if the relevant Hedging
Agreement is based on a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement); and

(C) any provision of a Hedging Agreement which is similar in meaning and effect to any
provision listed in paragraphs (A) or (B) above (if the Hedging Agreement is not based on an
ISDA Master Agreement);

(ix) (Instruction from the Security Agent) if the termination or close-out is by a Hedge Counterparty and
the Security Agent has instructed it to terminate or close-out in accordance with paragraph (b) below;
or

(x) if, prior to a Distress Event (as defined below), DGHL has certified to the Hedge Counterparty that
that termination or close-out would not result in a breach of any term of a Credit Facility Document
or a Pari Passu Debt Document.

(b) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, a Hedge Counterparty must not demand or receive
payment for, and the Debtors will not pay or otherwise discharge, any of the Hedging Liabilities in cash or in
kind except for:

(i) scheduled payments due under and in accordance with the Hedging Agreements paid by the Debtors
in cash;

(ii) payments to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a result of
the operation of:

(A) any of sections 2(d) (Deduction or Withholding for Tax), 2(e) (Default Interest; Other
_Amounts), 8(a) (Payment in the Contractual Currency), 8(b) (Judgments) and 11 (Expenses)_
of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (if the Hedging Agreement is based on a 1992 ISDA
Master Agreement);

(B) any of sections 2(d) (Deduction or Withholding for Tax), 8(a) (Payment in the Contractual
_Currency), 8(b) (Judgments), 9(h)(i) (Prior to Early Termination) and 11 (Expenses) of the_
2002 ISDA Master Agreement (if the Hedging Agreement is based on a 2002 ISDA Master
Agreement); or

(C) any provision of a Hedging Agreement which is similar in meaning and effect to any
provision listed in paragraphs (A) or (B) above (if the Hedging Agreement is not based on an
ISDA Master Agreement);


-----

(iii) payments due out of the proceeds of enforcement of the security in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iv) payments due under the relevant Hedging Agreement in relation to any termination or close-out
permitted as set out above,

and provided that:

(a) subject to sub-paragraph (b) below, in the event of any termination or close-out by a Hedge
Counterparty pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) (Non-payment), above, which results in a
termination or closeout amount payable by the relevant Debtor (after the application of closeout netting) which exceeds £20 million (or its currency equivalent), without prejudice to the
Hedge Counterparty’s right to demand payment, the Debtors must not pay or otherwise
discharge, and the Hedge Counterparty must not receive payment for, such termination or
close-out amount unless and until 10 business days have elapsed from the date of such
termination or close-out; and

(b) on or following the occurrence of a Distress Event, without prejudice to a Hedge
Counterparty’s right to demand payment, no Hedging Liabilities shall be paid or otherwise
discharged (in the case of an insolvency event, to the extent the Hedging Liabilities are owed
by the insolvent Debtor) except pursuant to the receipt of payments referred to in subparagraph (iii) above and, in the event of any such payment or discharge other than pursuant
to the receipt of payments referred to in sub-paragraph (iii) above, the turnover arrangements
in the Intercreditor Agreement shall apply.

(c) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, a Hedge Counterparty must not make any
demand against a Debtor in relation to any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against
loss received by that Hedge Counterparty in respect of the Hedging Liabilities owing to it
(other than any indemnity contained in an ISDA Master Agreement), before the termination
or close-out of all hedging transactions of that Hedge Counterparty.

(d) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, no Hedge Counterparty or Debtor may,
subject to paragraph (e) below, allow any Hedging Liabilities or any amounts owing from a
Hedge Counterparty to a Debtor under or in connection with the Hedging Agreements to
which they are a party to be discharged by set-off, any right of combination of accounts or
otherwise.

(e) Paragraph (d) above does not apply to any such discharge:

(i) pursuant to the exercise of any payment netting, close-out netting or cross-affiliate
netting;

(ii) pursuant to the exercise by a Debtor of any right of set-off or netting:

(A) in circumstances where an event of default (however described) has
occurred in respect of that Hedge Counterparty (or that Hedge
Counterparty’s “Credit Support Provider” (as defined in the relevant
Hedging Agreement), if any) under the Hedging Agreements to which it is a
party and where no event of default (however described) is outstanding
under the Credit Facility Documents or Pari Passu Debt Documents; and

(B) other than against any Credit Facility Debt or Pari Passu Debt owing to that
Hedge Counterparty,

and for the purposes of sub-paragraph (A) above a Hedge Counterparty shall be
entitled to assume that no event of default (however described) is outstanding under
the Credit Facility Documents or Pari Passu Debt Documents unless and until it has
received written notice of an event of default from a Debtor or from the Security
Agent; or

(iii) following an acceleration event, pursuant to the exercise by the Security Agent or by
a Debtor at the request of the Security Agent or by the Hedge Counterparty (in each
case if the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as defined below) have consented) of
any right of set-off or netting of a Debtor or Hedge Counterparty.


-----

“Majority Super Senior Creditors” means, at any time, those Super Senior Creditors whose credit participations with
respect to Super Senior Liabilities at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the total credit participations with respect
to Super Senior Liabilities at that time.

“Majority Pari Passu Creditors” means, at any time, those Pari Passu Creditors whose credit participations with
respect to Pari Passu Liabilities at that time aggregate more than 50 per cent. of the total credit participations with respect to
Pari Passu Liabilities at that time.

_Permitted Payments: STL Liabilities_

(a) Prior to the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, the Debtors may not pay, and no STL Counterparty may
receive and retain payment of, any amount under a STL Agreement unless the payment is due and payable
under that STL Agreement and made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. On or following an
acceleration event, if any amount (following application of payment netting, close-out netting and crossaffiliate netting) falls due from a STL Counterparty to any Debtor under the STL Agreements, that amount
shall be paid to the Security Agent and applied in accordance the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement as
set out in “—Application of Proceeds”. Following the occurrence of an acceleration event, no member of the
Group may make payments of the STL Liabilities except from enforcement proceeds distributed as set out in
_“—Application of Proceeds” other than any distribution or dividend out of any Debtor’s unsecured asset (pro_
rata to each unsecured creditor’s claim) made by a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator,
compulsory manager or other similar officer appointed in respect of any Debtor or any of its assets. The
Intercreditor Agreement prevents the STL Counterparties and the Debtors, prior to the Credit Facility Lender
Discharge Date, terminating or closing out any part of any hedging transaction prior to its originally stated
maturity date unless it is able to do so under the relevant STL Agreement or with the agreement of the other
party thereto and:

(i) (Non-payment or non-delivery) the termination or close-out is by a STL Counterparty in
circumstances where any STL Liabilities have not been paid or any delivery under a STL Agreement

-----

Subject to “—Enforcement Decisions” below, the Instructing Group may give or refrain from giving instructions to the
Security Agent to take action as to enforcement in accordance with the Enforcement Principles as they see fit by way of
giving instructions to the Security Agent.

“Instructing Group” means:

(a) subject to paragraph (b) below, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu Creditors;
and

(b) in relation to instructions as to enforcement, the group of Primary Creditors entitled to give instructions as to
Enforcement as set out in “—Enforcement Decisions”.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security is being enforced or other action as to enforcement is being taken as set out in “—
_Enforcement Instructions” above, the Security Agent shall enforce the Transaction Security or take other action as to_
enforcement in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator (or any analogous officer in any
jurisdiction) of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as the Instructing Group shall instruct, provided that such
instructions are consistent with the Enforcement Principles or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent
considers in its discretion to be appropriate and consistent with the Enforcement Principles. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, the applicable Security Agent will not be required to take any action.

_Enforcement Decisions_

(a) If either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors wish to issue enforcement
instructions as described in “—Enforcement Instructions” above, the Creditor Representatives (and, if
applicable, Hedge Counterparties and/or STL Counterparties) representing the Primary Creditors comprising
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Pari Passu Creditors (as the case may be) shall deliver a copy
of those proposed enforcement instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and the
Security Agent shall promptly forward such Initial Enforcement Notice to each Creditor Representative, each
Hedge Counterparty and each STL Counterparty which did not deliver such Initial Enforcement Notice.

(b) Subject to paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) below, the Security Agent will act in accordance with enforcement
instructions received from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors.

(c) If:

(i) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either:

(A) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security
Agent to pursue (and notified the Security Agent of that determination in writing); or

(B) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination,

within three months of the date of the Initial Enforcement Notice; or

(ii) the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the date of the Initial
Enforcement Notice,

then the Security Agent will act in accordance with Enforcement Instructions received from the Majority
Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

(d) If an insolvency event (other than an insolvency event directly caused by any enforcement action taken by or
at the request or direction of a Super Senior Creditor or Pari Passu Creditor) is continuing with respect to a
Debtor then the Security Agent will, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors elect to provide such
enforcement instructions, act in accordance with enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super
Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

(e) If the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either:

(i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to
pursue (and notified the Security Agent of that determination in writing); or

(ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination,

and the Majority Super Senior Creditors:

(A) determine in good faith (and notify the other Creditor Representatives, the Hedge
Counterparties, the STL Counterparties and the Security Agent) that a delay in issuing
enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on


-----

the ability to effect a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or on the expected realisation
proceeds of any enforcement; and

(B) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the
Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the
Enforcement Objective before the Security Agent has received any Enforcement Instructions
from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors,

then the Security Agent will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority
Super Senior Creditors until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

“Super Senior Discharge Date” means the first date on which all Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally
discharged to the satisfaction of the relevant Creditor Representative(s) (acting reasonably) (in the case of the Credit Facility
Liabilities), each Hedge Counterparty (acting reasonably) (in the case of its Hedging Liabilities) and each STL Counterparty
(acting reasonably) (in the case of its STL Liabilities), whether or not as the result of an enforcement, and the Super Senior
Creditors are under no further obligation to provide financial accommodation to any of the Debtors under the Super Senior
Documents.

_Enforcement Principles_

The Instructing Group may only give enforcement instructions that are consistent with certain security enforcement
principles (the “Enforcement Principles”), including that:

(a) It shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement to maximise, to the extent consistent with a
prompt and expeditious realisation of value, the value realised from enforcement (the “Enforcement
**Objective”).**

(b) The Transaction Security will be enforced and other action as to enforcement will be taken such that either:

(i) to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, all proceeds of
enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution as set out in “—Application
_of Proceeds”; or_

(ii) to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, either:

(A) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for distribution as set
out in “— _Application of Proceeds”; or_

(B) sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received by the Security Agent in cash to
ensure that, when the proceeds are applied as set out in “—Application of Proceeds”, the
Super Senior Discharge Date will occur (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree
otherwise).

(c) On:

(i) a proposed enforcement in relation to assets subject to Transaction Security other than shares in a
member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds £5 million (or its
equivalent in any other currency or currencies); or

(ii) a proposed enforcement in relation to assets subject to Transaction Security comprising some or all
of the shares in a member of the Group,

which, in either case, is not being effected through a public auction, the Security Agent shall, if requested by
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, appoint a financial adviser to
provide an opinion that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with that enforcement are fair from a
financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances (a “Fairness Opinion”) in relation to
that enforcement, provided that the Security Agent shall not be required to appoint a financial adviser nor
obtain a Fairness Opinion if a proposed enforcement:

(A) would result in the receipt of sufficient enforcement proceeds in cash by the Security Agent to ensure
that, after application as set out in “—Application of Proceeds”:

(1) in the case of an enforcement requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Final
Discharge Date would occur; or

(2) in the case of an enforcement requested by the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, the Super
Senior Discharge Date would occur.

(B) is in accordance with any applicable law; and

(C) complies with the process set out in “—Distressed Disposals” below.


-----

(d) The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a financial adviser or to seek the advice of a
financial adviser unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement.

(e) The Fairness Opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Enforcement Objective has been met.

**_Option to Purchase and Hedge/STL Transfer: Pari Passu Creditors_**

Some or all of the Pari Passu Creditors (the “Purchasing Secured Creditors”) may, following any of: (a) an
acceleration event in relation to a Credit Facility or Pari Passu Debt; or (b) the enforcement of any Transaction Security (a
“Distress Event”), after having given all Pari Passu Creditors the opportunity to participate in such purchase, by giving not
less than ten days’ notice to the Credit Facility Agent, require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees) of all (but
not part only) of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Credit Facility Liabilities under the Credit Facility
Documents.

If more than one Purchasing Secured Creditor wishes to exercise the option to purchase the Credit Facility Liabilities,
each such Purchasing Secured Creditor shall acquire the Credit Facility Liabilities pro rata, in the proportion that its credit
participation under the Pari Passu Debt Documents bears to the aggregate credit participations under the Pari Passu Debt
Documents of all the Purchasing Secured Creditors.

The Purchasing Secured Creditors may, at the same time as effecting a Credit Facility Liabilities transfer, or at any
time on or after the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, by giving not less than ten days’ notice to the Security Agent,
require the transfer of all or, with the agreement of the relevant Hedge Counterparty or STL Counterparty, as applicable,
some, of the Hedging Agreements and STL Agreement and all rights in respect of the Hedging Liabilities and STL
Liabilities.

**_Release of the Security_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in the case of a Non-Distressed Disposal (as defined below) the Security
Agent is irrevocably authorised (A) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over
that asset; (B) where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a member of the Group (or a holding company of any
member of the Group, which holding company is itself a member of the Group), to release the Transaction Security (as
applicable) or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that member of the Group’s and its subsidiaries’ property;
and (C) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of Transaction Security (as applicable) or any claim described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) above and issue any certificates of non-crystallisation of any floating charge or any consent to dealing
that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable.

If a member of the Group is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of each of the Credit
Facility Documents and Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised and obliged to release the
Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that member of the Group and its subsidiaries’
assets.

If a guarantor of a Credit Facility is released from its guarantee liabilities in accordance with the terms of each of the
Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents and does not have any actual or prospective borrowing
liabilities, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised and obliged (at the request in writing by, and at the cost of, the
relevant Debtor or DGHL and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor to
release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that guarantor of Credit Facility
assets.

In the event of a Non-Distressed Disposal or designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary, each release of Transaction
Security or any claim described above shall be contingent upon that Non-Distressed Disposal or resignation being effected,
and in the event that such Non-Distressed Disposal is not effected or the conditions for such release are not fulfilled (as
relevant), the Transaction Security shall not be released.

In the event that any security granted pursuant to the Security Documents is permitted to be released pursuant to the
terms of each of the Credit Facility Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorised and obliged (at the request in writing by, and at the cost of, the relevant Debtor or DGHL and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Debtor) to release such Transaction Security or any other
claim (relating to a Debt Document).

If any disposal proceeds are required to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Credit Facility Liabilities or the
Pari Passu Liabilities then those disposal proceeds shall be applied in accordance with the relevant debt documents and the
consent of any other party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be required for that application.


-----

A “Non-Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group or an asset which is subject to the
Transaction Security to:

outside the Group, in each case, where:

(i)

(1) DGHL confirms in writing to the Security Agent that such disposal, and if the disposal is of
assets subject to the Transaction Security, the release of Transaction Security, is not
prohibited by the terms of any Credit Facility Document or Pari Passu Debt Document (or, if
such disposal and/or release is prohibited by the terms of any such Debt Document, that it has
requested that the relevant Creditor Representative(s) in respect of such Debt Document
under which such disposal and/or release is prohibited notify the Security Agent that such
disposal and/or release is authorised); and

(2) the Creditor Representative in respect of each Credit Facility Document and Pari Passu Debt
Document that prohibits such disposal, and/or release of Transaction Security, notifies the
Security Agent that that disposal and/or release is authorised under its Debt Document; and

(ii) that disposal is not a Distressed Disposal.

(a) to release the Transaction Security, or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any
release of that Transaction Security, or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallisation of any floating charge
or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or
desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release: (1) that Debtor and
any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (2) any
Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets; and (3) any
other claim of a Parent Entity, an Intra-Group Lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the
assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant Creditors and Debtors;

borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (2) any Transaction Security granted by any subsidiary of that
holding company over any of its assets; and (3) any other claim of a Parent Entity, an Intra-Group Lender or

-----

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed
by English law.

**Proceeds Loans**

The proceeds loan with respect to the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Fixed Rate Proceeds Loan”) will be documented under
an English law governed loan agreement made between the Issuer, as lender, and Drax Corporate Limited, as borrower (the
“Fixed Rate Proceeds Loan Agreement”). Pursuant to the Fixed Rate Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Issuer will lend to
Drax Corporate Limited the proceeds from the issuance of the Fixed Rate Notes. The proceeds loan with respect to the
Floating Rate Notes (the “Floating Rate Proceeds Loan”) will be documented under an English law governed loan
agreement made between the Issuer, as lender, and Drax Corporate Limited, as borrower (the “Floating Rate Proceeds Loan
**Agreement” and, together with the Fixed Rate Proceeds Loan Agreement, the “Proceeds Loan Agreements”). Pursuant to**
the Floating Rate Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Issuer will lend to Drax Corporate Limited the proceeds from the issuance
of the Floating Rate Notes.

Each Proceeds Loan will be denominated in pounds sterling and will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest
rate of the relevant series of Notes for which the Proceeds Loan relates.

Interest on the Fixed Rate Proceeds Loan will be payable in cash semi-annually, concurrently or prior to the relevant
interest payment dates for the Fixed Rate Notes. Interest on the Floating Rate Proceeds Loan will be payable in cash
quarterly, concurrently or prior to the relevant interest payment dates for the Floating Rate Notes. All amounts payable under
the Proceeds Loans will be payable to such account or accounts with such person or persons as the Issuer may designate from
time to time. The maturity date of the Proceeds Loans will be the same date as the maturity date of the relevant series of
Notes. The Proceeds Loans will be unsecured obligations of Drax Corporate Limited.

Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreements will be made without
deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that Drax Corporate Limited is required to
make any such deduction or withholding, it shall pay such additional amounts to the Issuer as may be necessary to ensure that
the Issuer receives and retains, in the aggregate, a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received under the
Proceeds Loan Agreements had no such deduction or withholding been made.

The Proceeds Loan Agreements will provide that, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Drax Corporate Limited shall
repay the Proceeds Loans in such amounts and on such days so as to ensure that the Issuer can make payments in respect of
repayments, redemptions or repurchases of the relevant series of Notes. The Proceeds Loan Agreements will provide that,
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Drax Corporate Limited shall pay the Issuer on demand any amounts under the
Proceeds Loans required to allow the Issuer to pay additional amounts due under the Indenture governing the Notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Security—Proceeds Loans.”

The Proceeds Loans will be assigned by way of security to the Security Agent for the benefit of holders of the Notes,
the lenders under the New Senior Facilities Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements (including under the
Secured Trading Line). See “Description of the Notes—Security—Proceeds Loans.”

**ROC Agreements**

Drax Power has entered into separate receivable purchase agreements with each of HSBC Bank PLC, Lloyds Bank
Commercial Finance Limited and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the “ROC Agreements”) in respect of the sale by
Drax Power (on an uncommitted, non-recourse basis) of invoices relating to ROCs issued to Drax Power and sold by it to its
counterparties.

**Haven Power MRTSA**

Haven Power has entered into a master receivables and transfer and servicing agreement (“Haven Power MRTSA”),
under which Haven Power as seller and servicer, sells trade receivables (on a non-recourse basis) to Ester Finance Titrisation
as purchaser, with Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank as the arranger and calculation agent and Eurotitrisation
as the programme agent.

Drax Power guarantees Haven Power’s obligations under the Haven Power MRSTA.

**Pension Trustee Priority Deed**

The trustees of the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme (the “Pension Trustees”) will be granted second-ranking
security over the Collateral pursuant to second-ranking security documents (on substantially similar terms as the Security
Documents, save for ranking) (the “Second Ranking Security”). The ranking of the Second Ranking Security will be


-----

governed by the terms of an amended and restated second ranking security priority deed (the “Pension Trustee Priority
**Deed”) to be entered into by the Pension Trustees, the Security Agent and Drax Group plc and certain of its subsidiaries.**

The Pension Trustee Priority Deed will provide that, amongst other things:

     - the security constituted by the Security Documents, which secures the Notes, the New Senior Facilities and
the secured hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), shall rank senior
in order of priority to the Second Ranking Security;

      - prior to the discharge of the Notes, the New Senior Facilities and the secured hedging obligations (including
the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) secured by the Collateral, the Pension Trustees shall not take
any action to enforce the Second Ranking Security without the prior written consent of the Security Agent;
and

      - the Second Ranking Security shall not be amended in a manner which might reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the interests of the Security Agent or the security constituted by the Security Documents,
except with the prior written consent of the Security Agent.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalised terms used in this “Description _of_ _Notes” under the heading “—Certain_
_Definitions”. For the purposes of this “Description_ _of_ _Notes”, references to (i) the Issuer refer to Drax Finco plc only and not_
to its Subsidiaries (if any) and (ii) DGHL refer to Drax Group Holdings Limited only and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue £350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the “Fixed
**Rate Notes”) and £200.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Secured Notes due 2022 (the “Floating**
**Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated**
as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors, BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited,
as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the “Security Agent”), The Bank of New
York Mellon, London Branch, as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) and as calculation agent, and The Bank of New York
Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch, as transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) and as registrar (the “Registrar”), in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Indenture will not be
qualified under, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. The Issuer urges
you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, because they, and not this
description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the forms of the Notes, the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption
“Available _Information”._

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Group, together with drawings
under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, (i) to repay in full the Existing Term Debt, (ii) to repay in full the Bridge
Facility, (iii) to pay costs, expenses and fees (legal, accounting or otherwise) in connection with the Refinancing and (iv) for
general corporate purposes as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use _of_ _Proceeds”._

The Issuer may from time to time after this Offering issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes having
identical terms and conditions as the Notes (the “Additional Notes”). The Fixed Rate Notes (together with any additional
Fixed Rate Notes issued from time to time (the “Additional Fixed Rate Notes”)) and the Floating Rate Notes (together with
any additional Floating Rate Notes issued from time to time (the “Additional Floating Rate Notes”)) will constitute separate
series of Notes, but shall be treated as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments
and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series. The Issuer will only be permitted to issue
Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the covenant restricting the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation_ _on_ _Indebtedness” and “—_ _Certain_ _Covenants—Limitation_ _on_ _Liens”, respectively). Except as_
otherwise provided in the Indenture, the Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under
the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect
to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description _of_
_Notes”, references to the “Notes” include any Additional Notes that are actually issued._

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements.
The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of Indebtedness and security,
the ability to make payments in respect of the Indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the
subordination of certain Indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees and the payment waterfall for
amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement”_
for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have
rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of Notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer and will:

     - rank pari _passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not expressly_
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including Indebtedness Incurred under the New Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Opus Facility and certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading
Line);

    - be senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes;


-----

    - be secured by the Collateral on and from the Issue Date, but the Holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds
from the enforcement over the Collateral and certain distressed disposals after certain obligations of DGHL and its
Subsidiaries, including the Indebtedness under the New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging
Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), have been repaid and discharged in full;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by property or assets
that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligations; and

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of DGHL.

The Notes will be represented by one or more registered Notes in global registered form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes. See “Book-Entry; _Delivery_ _and_ _Form”._

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the Holders of the
Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral or from certain distressed disposals of the Collateral only
after (i) the lenders under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, (ii) counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (including
the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), (iii) lenders or creditors under certain other Indebtedness permitted to be
Incurred on a super priority basis under the Indenture (including any Indebtedness that refinances the New Senior Facilities
Agreement) and (iv) certain amounts owing to the Security Agent, any receiver and certain creditor representatives (including
the Trustee) have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on the Issue Date. In addition, if required by the covenant described
under “—Certain _Covenants—Additional_ _Guarantees”, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in_
the future.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will be a general, joint and several, senior obligation of that Guarantor to
guarantee unconditionally and in full the principal of, premium on (if any), interest and additional amounts (if any) on, the
Notes and will:

    - rank pari _passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that are not expressly_
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including Indebtedness Incurred under the New Senior
Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line);

    - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

    - be secured by the Collateral as set forth under “—Security”, but the Holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds
from the enforcement over the Collateral and certain distressed disposals after certain obligations of DGHL and its
Subsidiaries, including the Indebtedness under the New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging
Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), have been repaid and discharged in full;

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of any Subsidiaries of DGHL that are not
Guarantors or the Issuer; and

    - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are secured by property or
assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
obligations.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and the Security Interests it has granted to secure its Note
Guarantee, if any, will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of
share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the
Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations,
see “Certain _Insolvency_ _Considerations_ _and_ _Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_ _Enforceability_ _of_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _Security”. By_
virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee and its Security Interests, if any, could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes. See also “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the_
_Guarantees_ _and_ _Our_ _Capital_ _Structure—Each_ _Guarantee_ _and_ _security_ _interest_ _will_ _be_ _subject_ _to_ _certain_ _limitations_ _on_
_enforcement_ _and_ _may_ _be_ _limited_ _by_ _applicable_ _law_ _or_ _subject_ _to_ _certain_ _defences_ _that_ _may_ _limit_ _its_ _validity_ _and_
_enforceability”._

**_General_**

The Issuer is a special purpose vehicle and has no material liabilities (including any financial indebtedness) or assets
other than, following the Issue Date, its liabilities under the Notes and the Indenture, its guarantee under the New Senior
Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) and its
claims under the Proceeds Loan Agreements pursuant to which the proceeds from the issue of the Notes will be on lent to


-----

Drax Corporate Limited. Accordingly, the Issuer is dependent on payments under the Proceeds Loans to meet its obligations,
including under the Indenture and the Notes. All of the operations of Drax Corporate Limited will be conducted through its
Subsidiaries and, therefore, Drax Corporate Limited will in turn depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its
obligations, including its obligations under its Note Guarantee and the Proceeds Loan Agreements.

Certain Restricted Subsidiaries, which include Drax Biomass Holdings Limited, Drax Holdings Limited, Drax Ouse,
Drax GCo Limited, Drax Pension Trustees Limited, Drax Group Project Services Limited, Drax CCS Limited, Drax
Generation (Selby) Limited, Abergelli Power Limited, Hirwaun Power Limited, Millbrook Power Limited, Pike Bioenergy
LLC Progress Power Limited, Opus Energy Marketing Limited, Opus Gas Limited, Select Energy Limited, Domus Energy
Limited and Opus Water Limited will not guarantee the Notes. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of
any of the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-Guarantor Subsidiary’s bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganisation (and
the consequent right of the Holders of Notes to participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to that nonGuarantor Subsidiary’s Indebtedness and other obligations (including trade payables, preference shares and lease obligations,
if any), except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognised as a creditor of the non-Guarantor
Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be effectively
subordinated to any obligations secured over the assets of the non-Guarantor Subsidiary and subordinated in right of payment
to any Indebtedness of the non-Guarantor Subsidiary that is senior to the claims held by the Issuer or such Guarantor. See
“Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _Our_ _Capital_ _Structure—The_ _Notes_ _and_ _each_ _of_ _the_
_Guarantees_ _will_ _be_ _structurally_ _subordinated_ _to_ _present_ _and_ _future_ _liabilities_ _of_ _DGHL’s_ _non-Guarantor_ _subsidiaries”._

For the year ended 31 December 2016, after giving pro forma effect to the Opus Acquisition, the Guarantors generated
£303.9 million representing 100 per cent., of the Group’s Pro Forma CfD Adjusted EBITDA. As of 31 December 2016, the
total assets of the Guarantors (other than Guarantors that were members of the Opus Group at that date) were £3,443.0
million (excluding goodwill), representing 100 per cent. of the Group’s total assets excluding goodwill of £14.5 million as of
that date. As of 31 December 2016, the total assets of the Guarantors that were members of the Opus Group at that date were
£179 million (calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding intra-group items, goodwill and investments in
subsidiaries of Opus), representing 100 per cent. of the Opus Group’s total assets excluding goodwill as of 31 December
2016. As of December 31, 2016, after giving pro _forma effect to the Refinancing as if it had occurred on that date, DGHL_
and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have had £597.1 million of Indebtedness outstanding, of which £550.0 million is
represented by the Notes and £35.0 million is represented by the New Senior Facilities Agreement. As of December 31,
2016, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing as if it had occurred on that date, the Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL
that will not guarantee the Notes would have had no outstanding third-party Indebtedness. The Guarantees of the Guarantors
may be released as set forth under “Note _Guarantees—Releases_ _of_ _the_ _Notes_ _Guarantees”._

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of DGHL’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture.
However, under the circumstances described below under the definition of “Unrestricted _Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be_
permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will
not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. Further, Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not
guarantee the Notes.

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue £350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes and £200.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of Floating Rate Notes on the Issue Date. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on 1 May 2022 and the
Floating Rate Notes will mature on 1 May 2022. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in
integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at a rate of 4.250% per annum and will:

    - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrear on 1 May and 1 November of each year, commencing on 1 November
2017;

    - be payable to the Holder of record of such Fixed Notes on 15 April or 15 October of each year, immediately
preceding the related interest payment date; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Fixed Rate Notes are subject to the applicable
procedures of the common depositary and Euroclear and Clearstream.


-----

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to
the sum of (i) GBP LIBOR, which is subject to a zero per cent. floor, plus (ii) 4.000%, as determined by the calculation agent
(the “Calculation Agent”), which shall initially be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. Interest on the Floating
Rate Notes will:

    - be payable in cash quarterly in arrear on 1 February, 1 May, 1 August and 1 November of each year, commencing
on 1 August 2017;

    - be payable to the Holder of record of such Floating Rate Notes on 15 January, 15 April, 15 July and 15 October of
each year, immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Interest Period.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on
the Floating Rate Notes.

“Determination Date”, with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is the first day of such Interest Period or,
if such day is not a Business Day, the last Business Day immediately preceding such day.

“GBP LIBOR”, with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits
in pounds sterling for a three-month period beginning on (and including) the Determination Date that appears on Reuters
Page LIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. London time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page LIBOR01 does not include such a
rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of four
major banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent to provide such bank’s offered quotation
(expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, to prime
banks in the London interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in pounds sterling for a three-month period
beginning on (and including) the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the
Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the rate for
the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates quoted by major banks in London, selected by the Calculation
Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Determination Date for loans in pounds sterling to leading
European banks for a three-month period beginning on (and including) the Determination Date and in a Representative
Amount. If the relevant GBP LIBOR rate is still not determined on the relevant Determination Date in accordance with the
foregoing procedures, then the GBP LIBOR for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately
preceding Interest Period. Under no circumstances will GBP LIBOR be lower than zero.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest
Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include 31 July 2017.

“Representative Amount ” means the greater of (1) £1.0 million and (2) an amount that is representative for a single
transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters **Page** **LIBOR01” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that**
page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (London time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest
Period (the “Interest **Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal**
amount of each Floating Rate Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount
by the actual amounts of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365. All percentages resulting from any of the
above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five onemillionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or
.0487655)). All pound sterling amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest pence (with
one-half pence being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the
Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of wilful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no
event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law,
_provided,_ _however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Floating_
Rate Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes will be payable by one or more
Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the registered Holder thereof
(being the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee).


-----

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive **Registered**
**Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in the**
City of London. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by cheque
mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive Registered
Notes. See “— _Paying_ _Agent_ _and_ _Registrar_ _for_ _the_ _Notes”._

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Note is not a Business Day at the place at which
such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain a Paying Agent for the Notes in the City of London. The initial Paying Agent will be The
Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain a Registrar in Luxembourg, and a Transfer Agent in Luxembourg. The initial Registrar
will be The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch, and the initial Transfer Agent will be The Bank of New
York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg Branch. The Registrar, the Paying Agent and Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain
a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate
transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders
of Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a
daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger _Wort) or, to the extent_
and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu). The Issuer, DGHL or any of its other Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in global registered form without interest coupons, as follows:

    - Fixed Rate Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A **Fixed Rate Global Notes”). Floating Rate Notes sold within the United States to**
qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by
one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Floating Rate Global
**Notes” and, together with the 144A Fixed Rate Global Notes, the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes**
will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for
the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

    - Fixed Rate Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S
**Fixed Rate Global Notes”). Floating Rate Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the**
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Floating Rate Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Fixed Rate
Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be
deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

The 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global Notes”.
Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to Persons that have accounts with
Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer
and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully under “Notice _to_ _Investors”. In addition, transfers_
of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and
Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes of a given series of Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes of the same
series (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S.


-----

Securities Act. Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note of a given series of Notes may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Note of the same series only upon delivery
by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under
“Notice _to_ _Investors” and such transfer is in compliance with applicable securities laws of any jurisdiction._

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in
the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If any Definitive Registered Notes are issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Notes, they will be
issued only in minimum denominations of £100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof, in
each case upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation
required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in
exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarised
below and described more fully under “Notice _to_ _Investors”._

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred
or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of
£1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or
exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information
regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made
without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes of the relevant series:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes of such series;

(2) for a period of 15 days prior to the date fixed for selection of the Notes of such series to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date with respect to such
Notes; or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control
Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Security Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to
treat the registered Holders of the Notes as the owners thereof for all purposes.

**_Releases of Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor will be released automatically:

    - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant
Subsidiary Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or other disposition
(including by way of a consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor, if
the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation_
_on_ _Sales_ _of_ _Assets_ _and_ _Subsidiary_ _Stock” and the Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of_
DGHL as a result of the sale or other disposition;

    - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes, legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction _and_
_Discharge”;_

    - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including upon an
enforcement action;

    - as described under “—Amendments _and_ _Waivers”;_

    - as described in the covenant described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Additional_ _Guarantees”;_


-----

    - upon written notice from DGHL to the Trustee, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
_provided that, after giving pro_ _forma effect to such release, DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries are in compliance_
with the covenant described below under “— _Certain_ _Covenants—Additional_ _Guarantees”;_

    - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation; or

    - as a result of any transaction permitted by “— _Certain_ _Covenants—Merger_ _and_ _Consolidation”._

The Note Guarantee of DGHL will be released automatically:

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes, legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction _and_
_Discharge”;_

    - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including upon an
enforcement action;

    - as described under “—Amendments _and_ _Waivers”;_

    - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation; or

    - as a result of any transaction permitted by “—Certain _Covenants—Merger_ _and_ _Consolidation”._

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions, if any, including the granting of releases or waivers
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by DGHL to effectuate
any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders or any other action or
consent on the part of the Trustee (and each holder of the Notes will be deemed to have irrevocably authorised the Trustee
and the Security Agent to execute and deliver (and, at the request and cost of DGHL, each of the Trustee and the Security
Agent will execute and deliver) any document to the extent necessary or reasonably requested by DGHL to evidence such
release and termination).

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by security interests over the following:

    - a first-ranking share charge over the shares of DGHL and a security assignment of certain receivables owed to Drax
Group plc by DGHL;

    - a first-ranking fixed and floating charge over substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, including a charge over the
receivables owed to the Issuer in respect of the Proceeds Loans pursuant to which the proceeds of the Notes are onlent;

    - a first-ranking share charge over the shares of the Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantor;

    - a first-ranking fixed and floating charge over substantially all of the assets of each Guarantor incorporated or
organised under the laws of England and Wales; and

    - a first-ranking all asset security over assets of each Guarantor located in the United States other than any real
property located in the United States.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of
the Notes and holders of certain other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral (including obligations under the
New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading
Line)). Any additional security interests that may in the future be pledged to secure obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees would also constitute Collateral. The Collateral will be pledged on a junior basis to the Notes to the pension
trustee under the Drax Power Group section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme. See “Description _of_ _Certain_
_Financing_ _Arrangements—Pension_ _Trustee_ _Priority_ _Deed”._

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain _Covenants—No_
_Impairment_ _of_ _Security_ _Interest” and “—_ _Certain_ _Covenants—Limitation_ _on_ _Liens”, DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries_
will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with certain future issuances of Indebtedness of DGHL,
the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognise certain limitations arising under or imposed by
local law and defences generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief


-----

description of such limitations, see “Certain _Insolvency_ _Considerations_ _and_ _Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_ _Enforceability_ _of_
_Guarantees_ _and_ _Security”._

The proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of
Notes and the creditors of other obligations secured thereby. No appraisals of any Collateral have been prepared by or on
behalf of the Issuer, the Security Agent or the Trustee in connection with the offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all
of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be
able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _Our_
_Capital_ _Structure—The_ _Collateral_ _may_ _not_ _be_ _sufficient_ _to_ _secure_ _the_ _obligations_ _under_ _the_ _Notes”._

**_Agreed Security Principles_**

In determining the giving of a Note Guarantee and what Liens will be provided in support of the Notes and the Note
Guarantees and the extent of its perfection, the Agreed Security Principles will apply. The Agreed Security Principles
embody a recognition that there may be certain practical and legal difficulties in obtaining effective Guarantees and Security
from members of the DGHL Group in every jurisdiction in which DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries are located. Subject
as referred to in the third paragraph below, Note Guarantees will not be given and Security Interests shall not be created or
perfected to the extent that:

(1) it would result in a breach of general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, “thin capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”, transfer pricing,
capital maintenance, retention of title claims and similar principles, laws or regulations, provided that DGHL
will use reasonable endeavours to (a) assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to each
relevant Guarantor and (b) complete any whitewash or similar procedure required under any relevant financial
assistance laws;

(2) the provision and/or perfection of such Note Guarantees or Security Interests would result in costs (including
interest deductability, stamp duty, notarisation or registration fees) to the DGHL Group or a significant tax
disadvantage that, in either case, would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders of the
Notes;

(3) such assets are subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by the Indenture and which prevent
those assets from being charged (or assets which, if charged, would give a third party the right to terminate or
otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations of the DGHL Group in respect of those assets or
require any member of the DGHL Group to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the DGHL
Group or any member thereof). Such assets will be excluded from any relevant Security Document (other than
from any floating charge granted pursuant to a Security Document governed by English law), provided that
reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary if the facility agent under the New Senior Facilities Agreement determines the relevant asset to be
material and (taking into account DGHL’s view on any likely impact on commercial relationships with third
parties) reasonably requests, consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant
jurisdiction, DGHL to do so, and provided further, that such requirement to use reasonable endeavours shall
not apply:

(a) in respect of any asset owned or acquired by the Issuer or any Guarantor that is subject to a Security
Interest securing a purchase money, Project Finance Indebtedness, capital or finance lease obligation
or Acquired Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Indenture (or a refinancing of any
of the foregoing) if the contract or other agreement in which such Security Interest is granted (or the
documentation providing for such purchase money, project financing, capital or finance lease
obligation or Acquired Indebtedness or such refinancing) prohibits or restricts the creation of any
other Security Interest on such assets (including if the grant of any other Security Interest would
constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a right on the part of
any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, such contract or agreement or such
documentation); or

(b) in the case of any capital stock of any Person that is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, if such
Security Interest is prohibited or restricted (including if the grant of a Security Interest would
constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a right on the part of
any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, any such document, contract or other agreement)
by any organisational or governance documents of such Person, any applicable shareholder or similar
agreement or any contract or other agreement governing Indebtedness of such Person; or

(4) it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant member of the DGHL Group to give the Note Guarantee or
enter into the Security Document or it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of the Issuer’s or Guarantor’s


-----

directors or officers and/or contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or could reasonably be expected to
result in personal or criminal liability on the part of any director or officer provided that the relevant Issuer or
Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle.

No Note Guarantee, indemnity or Security Interest will be required to be provided by (i) any Unrestricted Subsidiary,
(ii) any Receivables Subsidiary, or (iii) any Project Finance Subsidiary.

Where appropriate to overcome any of the matters referred to the first paragraph above, the obligations arising under
Note Guarantees and the obligations secured under a Security Interest will be limited:

(1) to avoid any breach of corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalisation”,
“earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”, transfer pricing, capital maintenance, retention of title
claims and similar principles, rules or the laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable
jurisdiction; and

(2) to avoid any risk to officers of the relevant member of the DGHL Group that is granting a Lien of
contravention of their fiduciary duties and/or civil or criminal or personal liability.

The following factors will apply when determining the extent of the Note Guarantees and the Liens to be provided:

(1) the maximum amount guaranteed or secured may be limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration
or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit to the Holders of the Notes of increasing the
guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes and duties;

(2) each Note Guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and each Note Guarantee
and Lien will be for all liabilities of the Issuer and Guarantors under the Notes and the Indenture in
accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of each relevant jurisdiction;

(3) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting Liens over
the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such Lien, Liens will be granted over the material
assets only;

(4) Liens will be taken in respect of all insurance policies of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than third party
insurance, public liability insurance, director’s and officer’s insurance and insurance of Guarantors
incorporated or organised under the laws of Delaware or any other U.S. state or territory), provided that such
insurance policy does not prohibit such Lien to be so granted and provided further that no perfection of Liens
or notification to any third party shall be required in respect of insurance policies until the Notes have been
accelerated as set out under “—Events _of_ _Default”;_

(5) where Liens are granted over an insurance policy, no loss payee or other endorsement shall be made on the
insurance policy;

(6) Liens will be granted over all intellectual property of the Issuer and the Guarantors, provided that no Lien
shall be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant
licensing agreement and provided further that no perfection or registration of Liens or notification to any third
party shall be required in respect of intellectual property until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under
“—Events _of_ _Default”;_

(7) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants Liens over its intellectual property it shall be free to deal with those
assets in the course of its business (including, without limitation, allowing its intellectual property to lapse if
no longer material to its business);

(8) Liens will be granted over all real estate owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor, provided that perfection or
registration of any Lien over real estate prior to the Lien becoming enforceable will only be required in
respect of real estate which is material to the DGHL Group (taken as a whole) and no perfection or
registration will be required in respect of leasehold property. Other than where real property of the Issuer or a
Guarantor is secured by a floating charge or other similar all-asset security, Liens need only be granted over
after-acquired real property where the value of such property is in excess of £2.5 million (unless the aggregate
value of after-acquired property not secured would exceed £5.0 million). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Liens will be granted over real estate in the United States;

(9) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants Liens over real estate, there will be no obligation to investigate title,
provide surveys or other insurance or environmental due diligence;

(10) Liens will be taken in respect of contracts of the Issuer or a Guarantor, provided that no Lien will be granted
over any contract which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant contract and provided further that
no perfection of Liens or assignment by way of security or notification to any third party shall be required in
respect of contracts until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events _of_ _Default”;_


-----

(11) Liens shall be granted over all intercompany and trade receivables, provided that no Lien will be granted over
any such receivables which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant contract and provided further
that no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected with respect to Receivables Assets that are subject to a
Permitted Lien, and provided further that no perfection of Liens or assignment by way of security or
notification to any third party in respect of such receivables shall be required until the Notes have been
accelerated as set out under “—Events _of_ _Default”;_

(12) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants a Lien over its receivables it shall be free to deal with those receivables
in the course of its business until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events _of_ _Default”;_

(13) Liens will be taken in respect of shares of the Issuer and the Guarantors, but, other than where shares owned
by the Issuer or a Guarantor in a subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor are secured by a floating
charge or other similar all-asset security, Liens will not be granted over such shares in subsidiaries of the
Issuer or a Guarantor that are not the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(14) where the Issuer or a Guarantor grants Liens over shares, it will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting
rights appertaining to any shares charged by it until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—
_Events_ _of_ _Default”, provided that such voting rights are not exercised in a manner which materially adversely_
affects the validity or enforceability of the Lien;

(15) Liens will be granted over all bank accounts of the Issuer and the Guarantors other than those which are
specifically identified and not required to be secured under the terms of the New Senior Facilities Agreement,
_provided that no perfection of Liens or notification to any third party shall be required in respect of bank_
accounts until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “—Events _of_ _Default” and provided further_
that no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any (A) bank or securities accounts, and assets
credited thereto, used solely to hold funds in trust for any director, officer or employee of DGHL or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan maintained by DGHL or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries, (B) bank or securities accounts, and assets credited thereto, the funds and assets in which consist
solely of cash earnest money deposits, deposits to defease or to satisfy and discharge any Indebtedness or
deposits under escrow or similar arrangements in connection with any letter of intent or agreement for any
acquisition or investment permitted under this Agreement or that represent Escrowed Proceeds and (C) bank
accounts used solely for collections of receivables under Qualified Receivables Financings;

(16) subject to paragraph (20) below, where the Issuer or a Guarantor pledges shares or bank accounts, the Security
Document will (subject to any other provision of these Agreed Security Principles) be governed by the law of
the country of incorporation of the Issuer or Guarantor whose shares are being pledged or the law of the
country in which the bank account is located;

(17) subject to paragraph (8) above, where the Issuer or a Guarantor acquires assets of material value and/or
significance after the date on which it initially grants security, the Issuer or such Guarantor shall enter into
Liens in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles in respect of such assets if they are of a type which, if
owned at the Issue Date, Liens would have been created in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles
and to the extent that such assets are not subject to the existing Liens created by the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(18) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where the Issuer or the Guarantors are not incorporated,
but perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of the Issuer or one Guarantor in relation to Liens
granted by the Issuer or another Guarantor, respectively, incorporated in a different jurisdiction;

(19) no Note Guarantee or Lien will be granted to the extent to which the grant or terms of such Note Guarantee
and Lien, and (prior to the Lien becoming enforceable) the extent of the perfection requirements in respect of
such Lien, would materially and adversely impact the ability of DGHL, the Issuer or the affected Guarantor to
conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course of business or as otherwise permitted under the
Note Documents (including, without limitation, notification of security to third parties) until the Notes have
been accelerated as set out under “—Events _of_ _Default”; and_

(20) unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of DGHL, the Issuer
or a Guarantor or under English law, all security (other than security over shares in the Issuer or Guarantors)
shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of DGHL, the
Issuer or that Guarantor.

The following principles will be reflected in any Lien taken in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees:

(1) perfection of Liens, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable and, in
any event, within the time periods specified in the relevant Security Document or (if earlier or to the extent no
such time periods are specified in the relevant Security Document) within the time periods specified by
applicable law in order to ensure due perfection;


-----

(2) the provisions of each Security Document will not be unduly burdensome on DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries or interfere unreasonably with the operation of its business, will be limited to those required by
local law to perfect the Lien and will not impose commercial obligations;

(3) save where it is inappropriate under applicable law, Liens will not be enforceable until the Notes have been
accelerated as set out under “—Events _of_ _Default”;_

(4) representations and undertakings shall be strictly limited to those necessary for the creation, perfection or
maintenance of the Lien (and other matters to be agreed (all parties acting reasonably) with respect to third
party Liens given by the direct Parent Entity and shall not be included to the extent that the subject matter
thereof is the same as the corresponding representation or undertaking in the New Senior Facilities
Agreement;

(5) information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if, and only to the extent required by local law to be
provided to perfect or register the Lien and, when required, shall be provided no more frequently than
annually (unless required more frequently by local law) or, following an Event of Default which is continuing,
on the Security Agent’s reasonable request;

(6) Liens will, where practicable and legally possible, automatically create security over future assets of the same
type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges to be delivered in respect of
future acquired assets in order for effective Liens to be created over that class of assets, such supplemental
pledges shall be provided no more frequently than annually (unless required more frequently under local law
or where required to create valid security of equivalent strength and ranking as that expressed to be created
pursuant to the supplemental pledge or any existing Lien);

(7) in respect of the share pledges, the customary limitations on the exercise of voting rights to the extent these
purport to protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens over shares shall apply. In addition, until the
Notes have been accelerated as set out under “Events _of_ _Default”, the pledgors will be permitted to retain and_
to exercise voting rights to any shares pledged by them in a manner which does not adversely affect the
validity or enforceability of the Liens or cause an Event of Default to occur and the pledgors will be permitted
to pay dividends upstream on pledged shares to the extent permitted by the Indenture;

(8) no control arrangements or perfection by control shall be required with respect to U.S. collateral other than
with respect to certificated equity interests of other Guarantors and Significant Subsidiaries; and

(9) each party to a Security Document other than the Issuer or a Guarantor shall only be able to exercise a power
of attorney after (i) notice of intention to enforce has been given following the occurrence of an Event of
Default which is continuing or (ii) if the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor has failed to comply with a further
assurance or perfection obligation (and any grace period applicable thereto has expired), but, in the case of
(ii), only to the extent necessary in order to complete such further assurance or perfection requirement.

The Issuer and each Guarantor shall be free to deal with any assets over which it grants Liens (to the extent not
otherwise prohibited by the Indenture) until the Notes have been accelerated as set out under “Events _of_ _Default”._

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security Documents
(the “Security Interests”) as between (in no particular order) (a) the lenders under the New Senior Facilities Agreement,
(b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), (c)
certain other Indebtedness entitled to be secured by the Collateral, including Indebtedness entitled to priority on enforcement,
(d) Holders of the Notes and (e) the Trustee, certain other creditor representatives, the Security Agent and the Holders of the
Notes, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides, among other things, that the
obligations under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the
Secured Trading Line) and the Notes are secured on a pari _passu basis by first-priority Security Interests; provided,_ _however,_
that the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals
only after the lenders under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations (including
the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), lenders or creditors under certain other Indebtedness permitted to be
Incurred on a super priority basis under the Indenture and certain amounts owing to the Security Agent, any receiver and
certain creditor representatives (including the Trustee) have been repaid and discharged in full. The Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for
the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the
lenders under the New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedge counterparties (including the hedge counterparties
under the Secured Trading Line). The ability to enforce may be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future
Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement” and_


-----

“Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _Our_ _Capital_ _Structure—Creditors_ _under_ _the_ _New Senior_
_Facilities,_ _certain_ _hedging_ _obligations_ _and_ _other_ _priority_ _debt_ _are_ _entitled_ _to_ _be_ _repaid_ _with_ _the_ _proceeds_ _of_ _the_ _Collateral_
_sold_ _in_ _any_ _enforcement_ _sale_ _in_ _priority_ _to_ _the_ _Notes”._

The Collateral will also be subject to second-priority Liens in favour of the pension trustees for the Drax Power Group
under the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (the “Second **Ranking** **Security”). In connection with the granting of the**
Second Ranking Security, the pension trustees, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent, DGHL and certain of
its subsidiaries will, on or about the Issue Date, enter into an amended and restated second ranking security priority deed (the
“Pension **Trustee** **Priority** **Deed”). The Pension Trustee Priority Deed will, among other things, provide that (i) the Security**
Interests constituted by the Security Documents, which secure the Notes the New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain
hedging obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line), shall rank senior in order of priority to the
Second Ranking Security; (ii) prior to the discharge of the Notes, the New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging
obligations (including the obligations under the Secured Trading Line) secured by the Collateral, the pension trustees shall
not take any action to enforce the Second Ranking Security without the prior written consent of the Security Agent and (iii)
the Second Ranking Security shall not be amended in a manner which might reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
interests of the Security Agent or the security constituted by the Security Documents, except with the prior written consent of
the Security Agent.

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, DG plc, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to secure
the payment when due of, among others, the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents have been or will be entered into by the relevant security provider
and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security Documents, the Security Agent will
act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from time to
time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as security agent of the lenders under the New
Senior Facilities Agreement and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations (including the obligations under the
Secured Trading Line) in relation to the Security Interests created in favour of such parties.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interests in the Collateral.
However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “— _Release_ _of_ _Liens” below. See “Risk_ _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the_ _Guarantees_
_and_ _Our_ _Capital_ _Structure—Creditors_ _under_ _the_ _New Senior Facilities,_ _certain_ _hedging_ _obligations_ _and_ _other_ _priority_ _debt_
_are_ _entitled_ _to_ _be_ _repaid_ _with_ _the_ _proceeds_ _of_ _the_ _Collateral_ _sold_ _in_ _any_ _enforcement_ _sale_ _in_ _priority_ _to_ _the_ _Notes.” and “—_
_Holders_ _of_ _the_ _Notes_ _will_ _not_ _control_ _decisions_ _regarding_ _the_ _Collateral_ _in_ _certain_ _circumstances”. The validity and_
enforceability of the Security Interests will be subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Certain _Insolvency_
_Considerations_ _and_ _Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_ _Enforceability_ _of_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _Security”._

Holders of the Notes may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favour
under the applicable Security Documents. The Holders of the Notes may only act through the Security Agent in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors, DGHL or its other Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders of Notes might not be able to recover any amounts
under the Security Documents. See “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _Our_ _Capital_ _Structure—_
_The_ _Collateral_ _may_ _not_ _be_ _sufficient_ _to_ _secure_ _the_ _obligations_ _under_ _the_ _Notes”._

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive
control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect,
invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash
payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Security Documents; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional_ _Intercreditor_ _Agreements” (including, without limitation, the provisions providing for_
foreclosure and release of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral, including upon an enforcement, and


-----

authorising the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents on its behalf), as the same may be in
effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance with its terms;

(2) authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to enter into the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and exercise their
respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith; and

(3) have appointed and authorised the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Please see the section entitled “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement”._

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain _Covenants—Additional_ _Intercreditor_ _Agreements”._

**_Release of Liens_**

DGHL, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors will be entitled to release Security Interests in respect of the Collateral
owned by DGHL, the Issuer or any such Subsidiary Guarantor under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not DGHL or a Restricted
Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain _Covenants—Merger_ _and_ _Consolidation”), if_
such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described below under “—Certain _Covenants—_
_Limitation_ _on_ _Sales_ _of_ _Assets_ _and_ _Subsidiary_ _Stock” or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor,_
_provided that, in the case of this sub-clause (b), after giving pro_ _forma effect to such release, DGHL and its_
Restricted Subsidiaries will be in compliance with sub-paragraph (2) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described below under “—Certain _Covenants—Additional_ _Guarantees”;_

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments _and_ _Waivers”;_

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant
defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction _and_
_Discharge”;_

(5) if DGHL designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include Collateral, or the sale
of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(8) as permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain _Covenants—No_ _Impairment_ _of_ _Security_ _Interest”;_

(9) to release and/or re-take any Lien on any Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
including as part of any Permitted Reorganisation;

(10) pursuant to the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitations_ _on_
_Liens”; or_

(11) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

DG plc will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral owned by it under the circumstances
described in clauses (3), (4), (6), (8), (9) and (11) of the preceding paragraph.

The Security Agent and the Trustee (to the extent action is required by it in order to effectuate such release) will take
all necessary action reasonably requested by the Issuer in writing to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes
and the related Note Guarantees in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document, subject to customary protection and indemnities.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders of Notes or
any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

**_Proceeds Loans_**

Upon the issuance of the Fixed Rate Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and Drax Corporate Limited, as borrower, will enter
into the Fixed Rate Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Issuer will loan to Drax Corporate Limited the


-----

proceeds from the issuance of the Fixed Rate Notes. Upon the issuance of the Floating Rate Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and
Drax Corporate Limited, as borrower, will enter into the Floating Rate Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which
the Issuer will loan to Drax Corporate Limited the proceeds from the issuance of the Floating Rate Notes. See “Description _of_
_Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—The_ _Proceeds_ _Loans”._

Each Proceeds Loan will be denominated in pounds sterling and will bear interest at a rate per annum at least equal to
the interest rate of the relevant series of Notes to which the Proceeds Loan relates. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes Proceeds
Loan will be payable in cash semi-annually, concurrently with or prior to the relevant interest payment date for the Fixed
Rate Notes. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes Proceeds Loan will be payable in cash quarterly, concurrently with or prior to
the relevant interest payment date for the Floating Rate Notes. The maturity date of each Proceeds Loan will be the same date
as the maturity date of the relevant series of Notes. The Proceeds Loans will be unsecured obligations of Drax Corporate
Limited.

Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the Proceeds Loan Agreements will be made without
deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable Tax. In the event that Drax Corporate Limited is required to
make any such deduction or withholding, it shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer retains a net
payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

The Proceeds Loan Agreements will provide that Drax Corporate Limited will make all payments pursuant thereto on a
timely basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payments obligations under the relevant series of Notes and the
Indenture, taking into account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture with respect to amounts
payable on the Notes.

The Proceeds Loans will be assigned by way of security to the Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes, the creditors under the New Senior Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations (including the obligations
under the Secured Trading Line) on a first priority basis.

**Optional Redemption**

not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of
one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 104.250% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes so

At any time prior to 1 May 2018, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Floating Rate Notes upon

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, all of the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate
Notes, in the event that holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of the
relevant series validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer or offer to purchase and the Issuer
or a third party making such tender offer or offer to purchase all the Notes held by such holders, within 60 days of such
purchase, the Issuer will have the right, upon not less than 10 and no more than 60 days’ prior notice, to redeem all (but not
less than all) the Notes of the same series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the
highest price (excluding any early tender premium or similar payment) paid to each other holder in such tender offer or offer
to purchase, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer or offer to purchase payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date).

**_General_**

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer may
repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection _and_ _Notice” below._

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of any Notes, it will, for so long as such Notes are listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding
immediately after such redemption.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions
thereof called for redemption on and after the redemption date. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record
date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose
name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders
whose Notes are subject to redemption by the Issuer.

If the Issuer chooses to exercise its optional right to redeem the Notes pursuant to the provisions summarised above, the
Issuer may in its discretion redeem one or more series of Notes, either together or separately.

In connection with any redemption of any Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such
redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if such redemption or
notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (provided, _however, that, in_
any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which such notice is first given, except that
redemption notices may be given more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), or such redemption may not occur and such notice
may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed.


-----

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select the
Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which such Notes
are listed, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear and Clearstream, or if such Notes are not so listed or such
exchange prescribes no method of selection and such Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or
Clearstream prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed
under “Book-Entry; _Delivery_ _and_ _Form”, based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection); provided,_
_however, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the outstanding aggregate principal amount of any Note not redeemed_
to less than £100,000. None of the Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Trustee will be liable for any selections made in
accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger _Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules,_
post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu). In addition to such publication,
if such Notes are in definitive certificated form, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the
Issuer will mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the
registration books of the Registrar (with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent).

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the
date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for
redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem a series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the relevant series of Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding
_Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise,_
if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change
in published practice or revenue guidance) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax
**Law”),**

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the relevant series Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the
payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment
without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures
available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be
reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the
applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The
foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one
payment on the applicable series of Notes and (b) mutatis _mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person_
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture.


-----

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—
_Selection_ _and_ _Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior_
to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts and unless at the
time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of
any notice of redemption of any Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s
Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that the Issuer or relevant Guarantor (but, in the case of a
Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts) cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures
available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognised standing qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Payor has been or will become
obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely
on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including, in each case, any successor entity) (each,
a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then
required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax, by or on behalf of any Payor or the Paying
Agent; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organised, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying Agent
with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any,
the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary
in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding, or deduction (including any such
deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received
in respect of such payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of,
or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation,
being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction)
but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such
Note or a Note Guarantee or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such
Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note
to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days
before any such withholding or deduction would be made), to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to
make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment
(where the Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required) more than 30
days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with respect to
the Notes or any Note Guarantee;


-----

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental
charge;

(6) where such withholding or deduction is required pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not more onerous to comply
with), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any law implementing an
intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any
person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary,
the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such
beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to
the relevant taxing authority in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding
the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available
to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. The Payor will attach to
each certified copy a certificate or other reasonable evidence stating that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the
certified copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or any
Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case
the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment
date). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof
that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional
Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse the Holder or beneficial owners, the Trustee and the Paying Agent for any present or
future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (or, in the case of enforcement, any
jurisdiction) from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to, any Notes,
any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in
connection with a transfer of the Notes after this offering and limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or
levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or
levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (6) of the proviso of the first paragraph under this
heading “Withholding Taxes”).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, transfer by a Holder
or a beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organised,
engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any
payment under, or with respect to, the Notes or the Note Guarantees is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change _of_ _Control”,_
each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to £100,000 or integral multiples of
£1,000 in excess thereof, provided that Notes of £100,000 or less may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such
Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the
Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any Notes of a series as described under this heading “Change _of_ _Control”, in the_
event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series and given notice
of redemption as described under “—Optional _Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or_
waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of redemption as
described under “—Optional _Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than_
the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change **of** **Control** **Offer”) to the**
Paying Agent (with a copy to the Trustee) who will send such notice to each Holder of any Notes:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the
Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on
the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change **of** **Control Payment”);**

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed) (the “Change **of** **Control** **Payment** **Date”);**

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that
any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in
order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent
lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or
portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount
of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive
Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent)
will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least £100,000 and
integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the
Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger _Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules,_
post such notices on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the
Holders to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar
transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of
a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire DGHL or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would
constitute a Change of Control.


-----

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes of a series upon a Change
of Control or repurchase any Notes of a series as described under this heading “Change of Control” if (1) a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer for such series of Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes of
such series validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption in respect
of the Notes of such series has been given in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer with respect to any Notes may be made in advance of a Change of
Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the
Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent
that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of
Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors.
The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness
under the New Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the New
Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of DGHL or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of
certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of
Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a
default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be
limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including the financial resources of DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes,_ _the_ _Guarantees_ _and_ _Our_ _Capital_ _Structure—The_ _Issuer_ _may_ _not_
_be_ _able_ _to_ _finance_ _a_ _change_ _of_ _control_ _offer”._

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all of the assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as
to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of DGHL
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has
occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of
a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal
amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness); provided, _however, that DGHL and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired_
Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro _forma effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness_
(including pro _forma application of the proceeds thereof), for the most recently ended two full fiscal half-years for which_
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred, the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in
respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a maximum aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) £350.0 million plus (ii) in the case of any
refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount
of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of DGHL or any Restricted
Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness being guaranteed is permitted to be Incurred


-----

by another provision of this covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated
to or pari _passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to or pari_
_passu with the Notes or such Note Guarantee to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or_

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_ _Liens”, Indebtedness arising by_
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of DGHL or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of
the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of DGHL owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the lender is not the Issuer or
a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is (i) unsecured and (ii) expressly subordinated in right of payment to
the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer,
or the applicable Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor to the extent legally permitted (DGHL
and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required in the reasonable judgment
of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or
criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such Indebtedness), except, in the case of
this clause (ii), in respect of the intercompany current liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of
business or in connection with the cash management operations of DGHL and the Restricted
Subsidiaries or if the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness of the Issuer or Guarantor does not
exceed £10.0 million; and

(b) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary and
(y) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than DGHL or a Restricted
Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not
permitted by this clause (3) by DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the related Note Guarantees
(including any future Note Guarantees) and any related “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, (b) any Indebtedness of
DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness Incurred under the New Senior Facilities
Agreement or Indebtedness described in clause (3) of this paragraph) outstanding on the Issue Date after
giving effect to the Refinancing and application of the proceeds therefrom, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness
Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clauses (4)(a), (4)(b), (4)(c) and (5) of this paragraph or
Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, (d) Management Advances, (e) any loan or other
instrument contributing the proceeds of the Notes to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary and (f) any loan or
other instrument contributing the proceeds of any Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with the Indenture;

(5) Indebtedness (a) of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary
or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition
of assets and assumption of related liabilities) DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary or (b) Incurred to provide
all or a portion of the funds utilised to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to
which any Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by DGHL or a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such acquisition or other transaction,
either (x) DGHL would have been able to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant after giving pro _forma effect to the relevant acquisition and the Incurrence of such_
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries for the most recently ended two full fiscal half-years for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding such date would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to
such acquisition or other transaction and related Incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5);

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements, Inflation Agreements and Commodity
Hedging Agreements Incurred for a bona fide business purpose (as determined in good faith by an Officer of
DGHL);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (a) Capitalised Lease Obligations, Purchase Money Obligations, mortgage
financings or other financings, which in the case of mortgage financings or other financings are Incurred for
the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of
property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business or (b) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the
purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or
personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of


-----

assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces
or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with
the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will
not exceed at any time (i) the greater of £50.0 million and 1.25% of Total Assets plus (ii) in the case of any
refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (7) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount
of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing, together with any VAT comprised in such fees, costs and expenses;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,
indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other Tax or other guarantees or
other similar bonds, instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by DGHL
or a Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of
business or in respect of any governmental, quasi-governmental or regulatory requirement (including, without
limitation, as required as a condition of participation in or otherwise permitted pursuant to energy market
subsidy schemes or initiatives), (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar
instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course of

subsidy schemes or initiatives), provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or other
similar instruments, the obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing, (c) the financing
of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business and (d) any customary cash management, cash
pooling or netting or setting off arrangements, including customary credit card facilities, purchase card,
electronic funds transfers, the collection of cheques and direct debits, in each case, in the ordinary course of
business;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations in
respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case,
Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or assets or Person or
any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or
disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or
disposition); provided that in the case of a disposition, the maximum liability of the DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair
market value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent
changes in value), actually received by DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such
disposition;

(10) (a) Indebtedness arising from the honouring by a bank or other financial institution of a cheque, draft or

(11) Indebtedness of DGHL and any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which,
when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all

Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference
Shares, an Excluded Contribution or a Parent Debt Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other

covenant described below under “—Limitation _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments” to the extent DGHL and its_
Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so
received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(11) to the extent DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first
paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (14) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “—
_Limitation_ _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments” in reliance thereon;_

(12) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this

connection with such refinancing, together with any VAT comprised in such fees, costs and expenses;

(13) Indebtedness arising from guarantees by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary granted to, or of any
Indebtedness incurred by, any trustee of any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other
management or employee benefit or incentive plan or unit trust scheme approved by the Board of Directors of
DGHL or any Parent Entity, so long as the proceeds of the Indebtedness so guaranteed are used to purchase
Capital Stock of DGHL or DG plc (other than Disqualified Stock); provided that the amount of any Net Cash
Proceeds from the sale of such Capital Stock of DGHL or DG plc will be excluded from clauses (c)(ii) and
(c)(iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Limitation _on_ _Restricted_

of, or by way of Subordinated Shareholder Funding to, DGHL (in either case other than through the issuance
of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, an Excluded Contribution or a Parent Debt
Contribution), and that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded
for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (14) of the third
paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Limitation _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments” to the extent DGHL_
and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are
so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to clause (11)
and this clause (13) to the extent DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment
under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (14) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below
under “—Limitation _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments” in reliance thereon; and_

(14) Indebtedness consisting of local lines of credit, bilateral or other non-syndicated facilities and/or working
capital facilities (including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder),
and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a
maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) £35.0 million plus (ii) in the
case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (14) or any portion thereof, the
aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such refinancing, together with any VAT comprised in such fees, costs and expenses.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the
first and second paragraphs of this covenant, DGHL, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to
time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such
Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of
this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred under the New Senior Facilities Agreement on the Issue Date shall be deemed
initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11) or (12) of the


-----

second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price
(not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other
provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) subject to the provision described under “—Financial Calculation” below, for the purposes of determining
“Total Assets” in relation to clauses (7) and (12) of the second paragraph of this covenant, Total Assets shall
(in case of revolving facilities) be measured at the option of DGHL on the most recent date on which the
commitments are obtained or the date on which the new Indebtedness is incurred and (in the case of term
facilities) the date on which new Indebtedness is incurred by reference to the balance sheet date of the most
recent fiscal half-year for which internal consolidated financial statements of DGHL are available; and

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the
amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

In any case where the amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to any clause in the second paragraph of
this covenant is or may be based on Total Assets, the amount that may be Incurred under such clause shall be deemed to
include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant
to such clause.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of original issue
discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional
shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations treated as Indebtedness
due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under
this “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness”. Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any_
date shall be the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall
be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of DGHL as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to
be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in_
Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness,
the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or
first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness
is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause
the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of
Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the
Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to sterling)
covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be
adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that DGHL or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect
on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Layered Debt_**

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also
contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee, if any, of such Guarantor on
substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in


-----

right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of
being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of
waterfall, other payment ordering, standstill or release provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of DGHL’s or any
Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation
involving DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of DGHL or in Subordinated
Shareholder Funding; and

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of DGHL or any direct or indirect
Parent Entity of DGHL held by Persons other than DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than in exchange
for Capital Stock of DGHL (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for
value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any
Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or
other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal instalment or
final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness”);_

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem,
defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other than any

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein as a “Restricted
**Payment”), if at the time DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:**

(b) DGHL is not able to Incur an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro_ _forma basis,_
to such Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made
subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments

other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph) would exceed the sum of
(without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from the
beginning of the half-year period commencing immediately prior to the Issue Date to the end

such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(v) in the event that an Unrestricted Subsidiary (designated as such subsequent to the Issue Date)
is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary, all of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary
are transferred to DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary or such Unrestricted Subsidiary is merged
or consolidated into DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of the amount received in cash
and the fair market value (as determined in accordance with the last paragraph of this
covenant) of any property or marketable securities received by DGHL or any Restricted
Subsidiary in respect of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets,
excluding the amount of any Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary that constituted a
Permitted Investment made pursuant to (i) clause (11) of the definition of “Permitted
Investment” and excluding any amount that replenishes the amounts available pursuant to
such clause or (ii) clause (19) of the definition of “Permitted Investment”, but only to the
extent that the original Investment which has been reclassified, exchanged for or the proceeds

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the preceding clause (i) to_
the extent that it is (at DGHL’s option) included in the foregoing clause (iv), (v) or (vi).

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares)
for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of DGHL) of,
Capital Stock of DGHL (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the issuance
of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through an Excluded Contribution or a Parent Debt

contribution will be excluded from clauses (c)(ii) and (c)(iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant and
clauses (6) and (14) of this paragraph;

(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated

loans or advances) equal to (a) £7.5 million, plus £7.5 million multiplied by the number of calendar years that
have commenced since the Issue Date, plus (b) the Net Cash Proceeds received by DGHL or its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (including through receipt of proceeds from the issuance or sale of its

warrants or other rights in respect thereof), in each case, to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds are not included
in any calculation under clause (c)(ii) or (c)(iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant and clauses (1) and (14)
of this paragraph and are not Excluded Contributions or Parent Debt Contributions; and provided _further that_
cancellation of Indebtedness owing to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary from members of management,
directors, employees or consultants of any Parent Entity, DGHL or Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with
a repurchase of Capital Stock of DGHL or any Parent Entity will not be deemed to constitute a Restricted
Payment for purposes of this covenant or any other provision of the Indenture;

carried over in succeeding calendar years);

(11) payments by DGHL, or loans, advances, dividends or distributions to any Parent Entity to make payments, to
holders of Capital Stock of DGHL or any Parent Entity in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of such

return of capital to the holders of such Capital Stock (as determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL);

(12) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the aggregate cash amount

-----

pursuant to this clause (14) shall not exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by DGHL or the aggregate
amount contributed in cash to the equity of DGHL, or contributed as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to
DGHL (in either case other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or an Excluded Contribution or a
Parent Debt Contribution or, in the case of Designated Preference Shares of Parent Entity or an Affiliate, the
issuance of Designated Preference Shares) from the issuance or sale of such Designated Preference Shares;

(16) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result therefrom), any

Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio for DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 2.25 to 1.0 on a
_pro_ _forma basis after giving effect thereto;_

(17) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result from), Restricted
Payments in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed the greater of £75.0 million and 2.0%
of Total Assets; and

(18) dividends, loans, distributions, advances or other payments by DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
or on behalf of a Parent Entity to service the substantially concurrent payment of regularly scheduled interest
amounts (including any additional amounts required to be paid by reason of a deduction or withholding for or
on account of Tax) on Indebtedness the proceeds of which have been contributed to DGHL or any Restricted
Subsidiary as a Parent Debt Contribution and that has been guaranteed by, or is otherwise considered
Indebtedness of, DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in accordance with the covenant described
under “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness”._

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such Restricted
Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face
amount. The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the fair market
value thereof as determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL, or, if such fair market value exceeds the greater of
£15.0 million and 0.4% of Total Assets, by the Board of Directors of DGHL.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist
any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue
Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any
Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral,
(1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the obligations under the Notes and the
Indenture are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, equally and rateably with, or prior to, in the case of
Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favour of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) above will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth
under “— _Security—Release_ _of_ _Liens”._

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining compliance with any pound sterling-denominated restriction
on the incurrence of any Lien where the Indebtedness secured by such Lien is denominated in a different currency, the
amount of such Indebtedness shall be the Sterling Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided,
_however, that if any such Indebtedness is Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency and is subject to a_
Currency Hedging Agreement (with respect to pounds sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the
amount of such Indebtedness expressed in pounds sterling shall be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness secured by any Lien that DGHL
or a Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any
outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies or a decrease in Total Assets
after such Indebtedness is Incurred (and such Indebtedness will be permitted to be refinanced with other secured Indebtedness
and so secured notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing, such excess shall continue).

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become
effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of (a) Drax Corporate Limited or any successor
borrower to make payments on the Proceeds Loans or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock, or with respect to any
other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to DGHL or any
other Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or_
liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill
requirements to) loans or advances made to DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by DGHL or
any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the New Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Indenture and the Opus Facility), the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or (b) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case described in (a) or (b), in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital
Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by or
merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary, or on which
such agreement or instrument is assumed by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an
acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or
any portion of the funds utilised to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to
which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by DGHL or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary and entered into or in connection with
such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another
Person is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person following the acquisition by or
merger, consolidation or combination with or into DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary (the “Successor
**Company”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall**
be deemed acquired or assumed by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company; provided _further, that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted to_
be Incurred under the Indenture;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2)
of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or
other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3);
_provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary_
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favourable in any material respect to the Holders
taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial
Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as
determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset
that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license
or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture
or securing Indebtedness of DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the
extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary;


-----

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalised Lease Obligations
permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so
acquired in the nature of those described in clause (c) of the preceding paragraph, or any encumbrance or
restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the
assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or
substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are
subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation
or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements, Inflation
Agreements or Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described
under “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement_
or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the New Senior Facilities Agreement, together with the Security
Documents, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary
in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL) or (b) constituting an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of an Officer of DGHL, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables
Financing; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation _on_ _Liens”._

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not less than the
fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by an Officer of DGHL); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset
Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such Asset
Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on DGHL’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the latest balance
sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a
result of which neither DGHL nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of
such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if DGHL and each other Restricted Subsidiary is
released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second paragraph of this
covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons who
are not DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness (x) has


-----

been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor and (y) is not Subordinated Indebtedness
of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary, having an
aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration
received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of
£100.0 million and 2.75% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this clause (2).

If DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds of the Asset
Disposition, within 365 days (or 545 days in the circumstances described in clause (8) below) of the later of (i) the date of the
consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be used by DGHL or such
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness” or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect_
thereof; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (1), DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness
and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness including,
but not limited to the New Revolving Facility made available under the New Senior Facilities Agreement) to
be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchase or redeemed;
(ii) unless included in the preceding clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness that is
secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari _passu or super senior basis with the Notes at a price of no more_
than 100% of the principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption and applicable prepayment or redemption
premium; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of DGHL
that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each
case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to DGHL or any
Restricted Subsidiary); provided that DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary shall prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem Indebtedness pursuant to clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this
covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase the Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total
aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal amount of the
Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Indebtedness (other than the
Notes);

(2) (a) purchase Notes pursuant to open market purchases or an offer to all Holders of the Notes, in each case, at a
purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), (b) redeem
Notes pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture and/or (c) make an Asset Disposition
Offer;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after
giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of
this paragraph or a combination thereof; provided that a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted
application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on
which such investment or application is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365-day period, if the investment or application has not been consummated by that date.


-----

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in the preceding paragraph constitutes “Excess
_Proceeds”. Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary may_
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not
prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 546th day if a binding commitment as described in clause (8) above
has been entered into), or such earlier time as the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the
greater of £60.0 million and 1.65% of Total Assets, the Issuer will be required within 30 Business Days thereof to make an
offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari
Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the
Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in
an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the
agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer may make an Asset
Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the 365 (or 545, if applicable) day period referred to above.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, DGHL or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes (including making any Restricted
Payment), subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered
in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively,
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
to be repaid or purchased on a pro _rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu_
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in sterling,
such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Sterling Equivalent determined as
of a date selected by DGHL or the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other
than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed
the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by DGHL or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after
the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset **Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will repay the**
principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it
pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has
been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro
rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer,
or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in
integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Notes. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms
of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five
Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount
equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the
Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee (or an
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause
to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the
Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of
£100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the
Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent
that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with


-----

the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by
virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

DGHL will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering
of any service) with any Affiliate of DGHL (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate
**Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of £15.0 million unless:**

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favourable to DGHL or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction at the
time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of £50.0 million, the terms of
such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors of DGHL resolving that such transaction complies with
clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_
_Restricted_ _Payments”, any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the second_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments”) or any Permitted_
Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2) and (14) of the definition
thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or
maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants
or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of DGHL, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted
stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee
benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance,
retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers,
employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of DGHL, in each case in the ordinary
course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among DGHL and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Receivables
Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities and employee
benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of DGHL,
any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (a) the Refinancing, (b) the entry into and performance of obligations of DGHL or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments pursuant to
or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date or described in
“Certain _Relationships_ _and_ _Related_ _Party_ _Transactions” in the Offering Memorandum, as these agreements_
and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from
time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to
the Holders in any material respect, and (c) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other
listing agreement;

(7) without duplication, the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any
arrangement or payment pursuant to which DGHL or any Affiliate of DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary is
required or permitted to file a consolidated or combined Tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any
consolidated group for Tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of
business; provided that payment under such Tax Sharing Agreement or arrangement shall not exceed, and
shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described under clause (7) of the term “Parent Expenses” and, that the
related tax liability of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be relieved;


-----

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case, in the
ordinary course of business, which are fair to DGHL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors or an officer of DGHL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on
terms no less favourable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary and
any Affiliate of DGHL or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely
because DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity
interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of
DGHL or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding
are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of DGHL in their reasonable
determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) any transactions for which DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the Trustee a letter from an
Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (a) fair to DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary
from a financial point of view or (b) on terms not less favourable that might have been obtained in a
comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

(12) investments by any Parent Entity in securities of any of DGHL’s Restricted Subsidiaries (and the payment of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of any Parent Entity in connection therewith) so long as (a) the investment
complies with clause (1) of the preceding paragraph, (b) the investment is being offered generally to other
investors on the same or more favourable terms and (c) the investment constitutes less than 5% of the issue
amount of such securities;

(13) pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(14) any (a) power purchase, fuel purchase, biomass tolling or management services agreements between DGHL or
a Restricted Subsidiary and an Unrestricted Subsidiary, (b) guarantee provided by DGHL or a Restricted
Subsidiary under or in connection with a power purchase, fuel purchase, biomass tolling or management
services agreement with an Unrestricted Subsidiary, or (c) agreement between DGHL or a Restricted
Subsidiary and a lender or creditor of an Unrestricted Subsidiary in connection with either of the foregoing
clauses (a) or (b), in each case, so long as such transactions taken as a whole are on terms that are no less
favourable to DGHL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by DGHL or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person (as determined in
good faith by DGHL);

(15) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(16) the sale of tax losses to DG plc or a Subsidiary of DG plc as part of a group relief surrender arrangement.

**_Limitation on Issuer Activities_**

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture, the Issuer shall not engage in any business activity or undertake
any other activity, except any activity (1) related to the offering, sale, issuance and servicing, listing, purchase, redemption,
amendment, exchange, refinancing, incurring or retirement of the Notes, the incurrence of Indebtedness represented by the
Notes (including any Additional Notes) or other Indebtedness of the Issuer permitted under the Indenture, lending or
otherwise advancing the proceeds thereof (including pursuant to the Proceeds Loans) and any other activities in connection
therewith or complementary or useful thereto (including in connection with the Refinancing); (2) undertaken with the
purpose of, and directly related to, fulfilling any other obligations under any financing of the Issuer (including, without
limitation, the Notes, the Indenture, the New Senior Facilities Agreement, any Additional Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) permitted under the Indenture (including for the avoidance of doubt, any
repurchase or purchase, repayment, redemption or prepayment of such Indebtedness or entering into and termination of
Hedging Obligations permitted under the Indenture); (3) undertaken with the purpose of, and directly related to, fulfilling the
obligations of the Issuer under any Security Document to which it is a party or any other document relating to the Notes
(including Additional Notes) or the making of Restricted Payments in accordance with the covenant described under the
caption “—Limitation _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments”; (4) related to the granting of Permitted Liens and Permitted Collateral Liens_
over its assets to secure the Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary if the grant of such Liens were otherwise permitted by
the Indenture; (5) related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of the Issuer’s corporate existence;
(6) related to the acquisition, holding or disposition of assets permitted to be held by it under the Indenture or reasonably

foregoing; and (10) not specifically enumerated above that is de _minimis in nature._

**_Limitations on Amendments of the Proceeds Loans; Payment of the Proceeds Loans_**

the Proceeds Loans; (3) change the currency for payment of any amount under the Proceeds Loans; (4) prepay or otherwise
reduce or permit the prepayment or reduction of the Proceeds Loans (save to facilitate a corresponding payment or

_Consolidation” and is completed in compliance therewith or in connection with any Permitted Reorganisation); or (6) amend,_
modify or alter, including with respect to ranking, the Proceeds Loans and/or Proceeds Loan Agreements in any manner
adverse to the holders of the Notes in any material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Proceeds Loans may be
prepaid or reduced to facilitate or otherwise accommodate or reflect a repayment, redemption, discharge, defeasance or
repurchase of outstanding Notes of the relevant series. Drax Corporate Limited or any successor borrower under the Proceeds
Loans shall make payments under and in accordance with the Proceeds Loans and the Issuer shall accept such payments.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

Each of the Issuer and the Guarantors will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the Notes
on the Euro MTF Market for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it
is unable to list or it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the withdrawal from the trading of the Notes on the Euro MTF Market, and thereafter
use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another “recognised stock exchange” as
defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within four months after the end of DGHL’s financial year, an annual financial report containing the
following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheet of DGHL as of the end of the two most recent
financial years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of DGHL for the two
most recent financial years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the

periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods for
DGHL, together with condensed footnote disclosure and (b) an interim management report of DGHL
containing an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial
year and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements, and a description of the principal risks and

disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to DGHL and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer or chairman of
the Board of Directors of DGHL or a change in auditors of DGHL, a report containing a description of such
event.

In addition, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act for so long as the Notes are
not freely transferable under the U.S. Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the U.S. Securities Act.


-----

The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee such other information that DG plc is required to make publicly available
pursuant to applicable rules and regulations of the UK Listing Authority (or any successor regulator) and the London Stock
Exchange (the “UK Listed Company Requirements”) as a result of DG plc having its ordinary shares admitted for trading
on the London Stock Exchange. Upon the DGHL or any Parent Entity complying with the UK Listed Company
Requirements (regardless of whether the DG plc’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on the London Stock Exchange),
to the extent that such requirements include an obligation to prepare and make publicly available annual financial reports,
information, documents and other reports in accordance with the UK Listed Company Requirements, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant,
_provided that, to the extent that material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or results_
of operations or financial condition of the Parent Entity that is the reporting entity and DGHL, a reasonably detailed
description of such differences shall be provided.

The Issuer will also make available to Holders and prospective Holders of the Notes copies of all reports furnished to
the Trustee on DG plc’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof and, to the extent that the rules and regulations of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the Trustee will also be made available at the
specified office of the listing agent in Luxembourg.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Trustee, the holders
of the Notes and prospective Holders of the Notes if such information referenced in the first paragraph of this covenant or
alternatively, the second preceding paragraph, has been posted to the Issuer’s, DG plc’s or DGHL’s website.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or
financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented,
except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and
(3) of the first paragraph of this covenant or the third paragraph of this covenant may, in the event of a change in IFRS,
present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of DGHL or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure
not of a type included in the Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain
any reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if it is a Class 1 Transaction.

At any time that any of DGHL’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would (if it were restricted) constitute a
Significant Subsidiary of DGHL, then the half-year and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from
the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of DGHL.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S.
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would
satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange
Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon
complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer and DGHL will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_DGHL_

DGHL will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not DGHL is
the surviving entity) or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or
assets of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in either case, in one or more related transactions, to another
Person, unless:

(1) either: (a) DGHL is the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
merger (if other than DGHL) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other
disposition has been made is an entity organised or existing under the laws of any member state of the PreExpansion European Union, Switzerland, Canada, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;


-----

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger with DGHL (if other than DGHL) or the
Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made will
expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee), executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of DGHL under the Indenture and its Note
Guarantee and the Proceeds Loans (to the extent applicable) and (b) all obligations of DGHL under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which
DGHL is a party, as applicable;

(3) immediately after giving pro _forma effect to such transaction or transactions (and treating any Indebtedness_
which becomes an obligation of the surviving Person as a result of such transaction as having been incurred
by the surviving Person at the time of such transaction or transactions), no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) DGHL or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than DGHL), or to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made would, on the date of
such transaction after giving pro _forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had_
occurred at the beginning of the applicable two half-year period (i) be permitted to incur at least £1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption “—
_Limitation_ _on_ _Indebtedness” or (ii) have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not less than it was immediately prior_
to giving effect to such transaction; and

(5) DGHL delivers to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with this covenant and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been
satisfied and that the Indenture and its Note Guarantee and the Proceeds Loans (to the extent applicable) each
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of DGHL or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (as applicable) enforceable in accordance with its terms.

In the event of any transaction described in and complying with the conditions listed in the immediately preceding
paragraph in which DGHL is not the continuing Person, the successor Person formed or remaining or to which such transfer
is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of DGHL and DGHL will be (other
than in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets) discharged from all obligations and covenants under the
Indenture.

_The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors_

The Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in
accordance with the terms of the Note Guarantee and the Indenture as described under “—Note _Guarantees”) will not,_
directly or indirectly: (i) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Issuer or such Subsidiary
Guarantor, as applicable, is the surviving entity) or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, and its Subsidiaries that
are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1) either (a) the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, is the surviving Person or (b) in the case of a
merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or in connection with the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance,
lease or other disposal of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer only, the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is an entity organised or existing under the
laws of any member state of the European Union, Switzerland, Canada, any state of the United States or the
District of Columbia;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer or such
Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease
or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as
applicable, under the Notes (in the case of the Issuer), its Note Guarantee (in the case of a Subsidiary
Guarantor), the Indenture, the Proceeds Loans, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents to which it is a party;

(3) immediately after giving pro _forma effect to such transaction or transactions (and treating any Indebtedness_
which becomes an obligation of the surviving entity as a result of such transaction as having been incurred by
the surviving entity at the time of such transaction or transactions), no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(4) DGHL delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee) stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with this covenant and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been
satisfied and that the Indenture, the Notes (in the case of the Issuer) and the Note Guarantee (in the case of a


-----

Subsidiary Guarantor) constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantor or
the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation and merger (as applicable) enforceable in
accordance with their terms,

_provided,_ _however, that the prohibitions in this paragraph above (in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor) shall not apply to the_
extent that compliance with clause (1) could give rise to or result in: (a) any breach or violation of statutory limitations,
corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance
and coordination rules or the laws, rules and regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (b) any risk
or liability for the officers, directors or (except in cases of a Subsidiary that is partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); or (c) any costs, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable outof-pocket expenses.

In the event of any transaction described in and complying with the conditions listed in the immediately preceding
paragraph in which the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, is not the continuing Person, the successor Person
formed or remaining or to which such transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right
and power of the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, and the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as
applicable, will be (other than in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets) discharged from all obligations and
covenants under the Indenture.

In addition, neither DGHL, the Issuer nor any Guarantor will, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of it and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related
transactions, to any other Person.

_General_

This “Merger _and_ _Consolidation” covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation or merger of any Restricted_
Subsidiary of DGHL that is not a Guarantor into the Issuer or a Guarantor, (b) any consolidation or merger among
Guarantors (other than DGHL in the case that DGHL is not the surviving entity of such consolidation or merger), (c) any
consolidation or merger among Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL that are not Guarantors or the Issuer, and (d) any
consolidation or merger among the Issuer and any Guarantor; provided that, in the case of this clause (d) if the Issuer is not
the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor is an entity organised or existing under the laws
of any member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union, Switzerland, Canada, any state of the United States or the
District of Columbia and such Guarantor shall assume all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Proceeds
Loans, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which the Issuer
is a party and, to the extent applicable, clauses (2) and (5) of the first paragraph under the caption “—DGHL” and clauses
(1) and (4) of the first paragraph under the caption “—The _Issuer_ _and_ _the_ _Subsidiary_ _Guarantors” will be complied with._
Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph under the caption “—DGHL” and clause (3) of the first paragraph under the caption
“—The _Issuer_ _and_ _the_ _Subsidiary_ _Guarantors” will not apply to any merger or consolidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor_
with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction, to
change its domicile or to change its legal form.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries may implement a
Permitted Reorganisation.

**_No Impairment of Security Interest_**

DGHL shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any
action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being
understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be
deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders
of Notes, and DGHL shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security
Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien over any of the Collateral
that is prohibited by the covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation _on_ _Liens”, except that (i) DGHL and its_
Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens; (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in
accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect
to the Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganisation and (iv) the applicable Security
Documents may be amended from time to time (a) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or
inconsistency therein, (b) to comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(c) to add Collateral, (d) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor and the assumption by
such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents,


-----

in each case, including in accordance with “—Merger _and_ _Consolidation,” (e) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of_
the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent and (f) in any manner that does not adversely affect the Holders in
any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (i), the Security Documents may not be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced (provided _further, that a confirmation_
agreement in respect of any Security Agreement shall not be deemed to be an amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release or other modification of that Security Document for purposes of this covenant) unless
contemporaneously with any such action, DGHL delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the relevant Person
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant
Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the person granting such
Security Interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, released, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to
any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject
to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement.
In the event that DGHL or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the
need for instructions from the Holders of Notes.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

DGHL will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to Guarantee the Indebtedness
outstanding under the New Senior Facilities Agreement, any other Public Debt or any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in
respect of the foregoing, respectively, of the Issuer or a Guarantor, in each case, unless such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a
Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
providing for a Note Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari _passu with_
such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall
not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is
contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of general statutory
limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference or thin capitalisation rules,
retention of title claims or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk
or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the
partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, DGHL shall ensure that on the Issue Date and within 60 days after the end of
each financial year, beginning with the financial year ending 31 December 2017:

(1) the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation calculated on the same basis as Consolidated
EBITDA attributable to the Guarantors (determined separately for each Guarantor and excluding all intragroup items and investments in Subsidiaries of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries) represent not less than
80.0% of the Consolidated EBITDA of DGHL and its Restricted Subsidiaries, provided that, if the
Consolidated EBITDA of any Restricted Subsidiary (calculated as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence) for any financial year is negative, the Consolidated EBITDA of such Restricted Subsidiary shall be
deemed to be zero for purposes of this clause (1); and

(2) the aggregate gross assets of the Guarantors (calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding all intragroup items, goodwill and investments in Subsidiaries of DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
represents not less than 80.0% of the Total Assets (excluding goodwill) of DGHL and its Restricted
Subsidiaries,

by causing one or more of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors to become Guarantors to the extent necessary to
ensure the foregoing thresholds are met. A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it
executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee
payment of the Notes on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and such supplemental
indenture.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
any such Restricted Subsidiary will, simultaneously with the execution of such supplemental indenture, pledge all of its


-----

existing and future assets to secure its Note Guarantee (other than an asset of such Restricted Subsidiary which is subject to a
Permitted Lien at the time of the execution of such supplemental indenture if providing such pledge would not be permitted
by the terms of such Permitted Lien or by the terms of any obligations secured by such Permitted Lien), and DGHL will
cause all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary owned by DGHL and the Restricted Subsidiaries to be pledged to
secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees; provided that any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to pledge such
Additional Collateral if the thresholds set forth in each of clause (1) and (2) would be satisfied notwithstanding such
Restricted Subsidiary’s provision of a Note Guarantee.

At the option of DGHL, any Note Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably
necessary to recognise certain defences generally available to guarantors or other considerations under applicable law or
regulation.

Subject to compliance with the second paragraph of this covenant, Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision
shall be released as set forth under “—Note _Guarantees—Release_ _of_ _Note_ _Guarantees”. A Note Guarantee of a future_
Guarantor may also be released at the option of DGHL if at the date of such release (i) there is no Indebtedness of such
Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with
the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date and (ii),
immediately after such release, DGHL complies with the requirements of the second paragraph of this covenant. The Trustee
and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor
will be subject to the limitations as described and set out under “Risk _Factors”._

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by DGHL or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted to be secured pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of Permitted
Collateral Liens, DGHL, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the
holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorised Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional
**Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on**
substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favourable to the Holders), including
containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the applicable
Security Interests; provided that (a) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement and (b) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any one time, the collective terms of such
intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure
any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness
covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to
the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional
Notes), (5) to facilitate a Permitted Reorganisation, (6) make provision for equal and rateable pledges of the Collateral to
secure Additional Notes, (7) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (9) make any other change to any such agreement
that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—
_Amendments_ _and_ _Waivers”, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to_
the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion
of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
prior to the taking of any Enforcement Action (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement), the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the


-----

Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_
_Restricted_ _Payments”._

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted
the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into
or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior
written request at the Issuer’s offices or at the offices of the listing agent.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection with any
acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment or similar transaction where there is a time difference between
commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Restricted Payments, Permitted
Payments, Permitted Investments and Permitted Liens), the date of determination of any such basket or ratio and of any
Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such acquisition,
disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment or similar transaction are entered into, and such baskets or ratios shall be
calculated on a pro _forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment or_
similar transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of
determining the ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any
basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in
such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Total Assets of DGHL or the target company) subsequent to such date of
determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to
have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is permitted
hereunder and (2) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related
transactions; provided, _further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such_
definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds therefrom)
shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of
calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such
transaction.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time,
if any, at which such Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture
summarised under the following captions will not apply to such Notes:

(1) “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness”;_

(2) “—Limitation _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments”;_

(3) “—Limitation _on_ _Restrictions_ _on_ _Distributions_ _from_ _Restricted_ _Subsidiaries”;_

(4) “—Limitation _on_ _Affiliate_ _Transactions”;_

(5) “—Limitation _on_ _Sales_ _of_ _Assets_ _and_ _Subsidiary_ _Stock”;_

(6) “—Additional _Guarantees”; and_

(7) the provisions of clause (4) of the covenant described under “—Merger _and_ _Consolidation—DGHL”,_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to DGHL
and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which
a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of DGHL
properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation _on_ _Restricted_ _Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has_
been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date,
all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the
Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness”. In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default,_
DGHL or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any
date on which such Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into


-----

during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of such Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer
shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption have been satisfied; provided that
no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective.
There can be no assurance that such Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event _of_ _Default” under the Indenture:_

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable, continued
for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Notes issued under the Indenture
due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(3) failure by DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in
the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may
be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
(or the payment of which is Guaranteed by DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than
Indebtedness owed to DGHL or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists,
or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”),**

and, in each case, either (i) the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated, aggregates to £50.0 million or more or (ii) such Indebtedness is incurred pursuant to
clauses (1) and (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_ _Indebtedness”_
and secured by Collateral that has been granted the benefit of super senior priority rights on the proceeds of
enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement and the “Instructing Group” (as such term is
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) has instructed the Security
Agent to commence enforcement of the Collateral in circumstances where the Security Agent is permitted to
take enforcement action in accordance with such instructions;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of DGHL or a Significant Subsidiary or group of
Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for DGHL), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by DGHL or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries of DGHL that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for DGHL), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating to in excess of £50.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a
solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or
stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other
than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of
£15.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the
release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest
created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for
10 days; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Guarantor ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the
terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding
or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default
continues for 10 days.


-----

However, a Default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the
Default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in clauses
(3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the
Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such percentage of Holders
shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due
and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable
immediately. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under
“Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically
annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied
or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of
the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all
existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely
because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the applicable Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or
existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect of any single series of Notes, a waiver of which would require the consent of 90% of the Holders
in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series of Notes under the Indenture) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee customary indemnification,
security or prefunding satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security, prefunding or customary indemnification satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of
such security, prefunding or indemnification; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right
to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be
required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own
affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior
to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification, security or prefunding satisfactory to
it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture
will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer,


-----

the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case
of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if
and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 120 days after the end of each
fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely
without further inquiry on), within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware
which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect
thereof.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if
the Trustee is indemnified, prefunded or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain
actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action,
notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture will provide that such Indenture, the Notes, the Proceeds Loan Agreements
and the other Notes Documents relating to the Notes may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent
of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any
default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, the Notes); provided that, if any waiver, amendment, supplement or other modification relating to the
Indenture, the Notes, the Proceeds Loan Agreements and the other Notes Documents will only affect one series of Notes,
(i) only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required and (ii) no
waiver, amendment, supplement or other modification will be effective with such series without the requisite consent of such
series. Without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding (provided that, if any waiver, amendment, supplement or other modification will only affect
one series of Notes, (i) only the consent of not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required and (ii) at least 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75% of the
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required) an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such Note
may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional _Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such
Holder’s Notes or any Note Guarantee in respect thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding _Taxes” that adversely affects_
the right of any Holder or beneficial owner of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such
Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Issuer or the
applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release (i) the pledge over the shares in DGHL and the Issuer, (ii) the security interest created over Drax
Corporate Limited’s or any successor borrower’s rights under the Proceeds Loans or (iii) all or substantially
all security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral, in each case other than in
accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of such Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);


-----

(10) release (i) DGHL or (ii) all or substantially all Guarantors from any of their respective obligations under the
Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in this
sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement the Proceeds Loan Agreements or any Notes
Document relating to the Notes to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
under such Notes Document, including, without limitation, in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon DGHL or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that does not
adversely affect the rights or benefits of the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under such
Notes Document;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by an Officer of DGHL) for the issuance of
Additional Notes;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee, to add Note Guarantees with respect to the
Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or
any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this “Description
_of_ _Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description_ _of_ _Notes” was intended to be a verbatim_
recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or the Security Agent pursuant to the
requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or the Security Agent to any Notes
Document relating to such Notes;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favour
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the New Senior Facilities Agreement, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the New Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on
the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the
benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—
_Certain_ _Covenants—No_ _Impairment_ _of_ _Security_ _Interest” is complied with;_

(10) evidence or provide for the release of any Note Guarantee or any Lien on any Collateral that is otherwise
permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) as provided in “— _Certain_ _Covenants—Additional_ _Intercreditor_ _Agreements”._

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence
as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of the Proceeds Loan Agreements or any other Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of the
Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the
Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger _Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by_
such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, no modification or amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, any
of the covenants described under “—Certain _Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of the holders of the_
Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under
direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Indenture
(“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those
respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the
obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of the
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security
Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described under “—
_Certain_ _Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the covenant described under “—Certain_ _Covenants—Merger_ _and_
_Consolidation—DGHL” and clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain_ _Covenants—Merger_ _and_
_Consolidation—The_ _Issuer_ _and_ _the_ _Subsidiary_ _Guarantors”) and “—Change_ _of_ _Control” and the default provisions relating to_
such covenants described under “Events _of_ _Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the_
cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Significant Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer),
the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events _of_
_Default” above (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its
covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect
to the Notes, payment of such Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than
with respect to clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the covenant described under “—Certain _Covenants—Merger_ _and_ _Consolidation—_
_DGHL” and clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain_ _Covenants—Merger_ _and_ _Consolidation—The_
_Issuer_ _and_ _the_ _Subsidiary_ _Guarantors”), (4), (5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer)), (6), (7)_
or (8) under “Events _of_ _Default” above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with
the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in pounds sterling or
pound sterling-denominated UK Government Obligations or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with
certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the relevant
Notes will not recognise income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit
and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the
case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with either
defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents, will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as


-----

to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all such Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been
released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all such Notes not previously delivered
to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated
Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer;
(2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by
the Trustee for this purpose), money in pounds sterling or pound sterling-denominated UK Government Obligations or a
combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on such Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case
of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer
has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions
to the Trustee to apply the funds deposited towards the payment of such Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the
case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which the
Trustee may rely on without further inquiry) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction _and_
_Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with,_
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the_
foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4)). If requested by the Issuer in writing, the Trustee or Paying Agent may distribute any
amount deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of DGHL or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such,
shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Proceeds Loan Agreements or any other
applicable Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth
specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its
own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will
not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to
obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realise on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or
otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with DGHL and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms will
include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any
time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes
insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, expenses Incurred
without gross negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Indenture. Any obligations under the Indenture of The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Luxembourg
Branch will be subject to bail-in powers under the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be published in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger _Wort) or if, in the opinion of the Issuer such_


-----

publication is not practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in Europe or, to the extent and in
the manner permitted by such rules, such notices will be posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes
will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once on
different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided _that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be_
deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or
communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be
sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a
Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed
in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be
prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the
payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Pound Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

The pound sterling is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors
under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees, if any, including damages. Any amount received or
recovered in any other currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in
respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or
such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the pound sterling amount that the recipient is able to purchase with the
amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to
make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If such pound sterling amount is less than the pound sterling amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee
as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis
against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima _facie_
evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the
Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other
judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or
to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any sterlingdenominated restriction herein, the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-sterling
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-sterling amount is

disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to
such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of DGHL or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted
Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any Indebtedness is
not denominated in DGHL’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of
Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS.

_Certain_ _Covenants—Limitation_ _on_ _Indebtedness” or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was_
immediately prior to giving effect to such designation, in each case, on a pro _forma basis taking into account such_
designation. Any such designation by the Board of Directors shall be evidenced to the Trustee by promptly filing with the
Trustee a copy of the resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation or an Officer’s Certificate
certifying that such designation complied with the foregoing provisions.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by one
or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Each series of
Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act (“Regulation S”) will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”).
The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (“Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and in the Regulation S
Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book**Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold**
interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries.
Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in bookentry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued
only in denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such
securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge BookEntry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes
registered in their name, will not have received physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered
the registered owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose (other than for certain tax purposes).

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, or its respective nominee, will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to
transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent, nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable,
will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of
the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on
such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their operational procedures; provided, however, that
no Book-Entry Interest of less than £100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if
any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will in turn distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer expects that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through
such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent
will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes.


-----

Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent or any of its or
their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry
Interest;

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

    - the records of the common depositary.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be
paid in pound sterling.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or more participants
to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in
respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream reserve the
right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”), and
to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of the Notes requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions which require physical delivery
of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of the Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in
accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indenture.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set forth under “Notice to Investors”. Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Notice to
_Investors”._

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests
will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S BookEntry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available
under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note
and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned
Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as
it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.


-----

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes only in
the following circumstances:

    - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a
successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

    - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such
Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar or the Transfer Agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a
partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a new
Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered
Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as
applicable; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of £100,000 or in integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15
calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the
Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer is not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for
repurchase in connection with a change of control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law
and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered Note has been
lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the Registrar or at
the office of the Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered
Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and
the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any
of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due
and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer, in
its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered
Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance with the
Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice
_to Investors”._

So long as the Notes are admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, we will publish a notice of any issuance of
Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
_Luxemburger Wort). Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be_
payable at the office of the Paying Agent in Luxembourg so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.
We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The
operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any
time. Neither us, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or
their respective agents are or will be responsible for those operations or procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for
participating organisations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their
respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and


-----

borrowing of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian
relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that
do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be
limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take
physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions
attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants
in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation
to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None
of us, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent will have any responsibility
for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in pound sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry
Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day
following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds.
Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry
Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired
value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain United Kingdom Tax Considerations**

_The comments below, which are of a general nature and are based on the Issuer’s understanding of current UK law_
_and H.M. Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) practice (which may not be binding on HMRC), both of which may be subject to_
_change, possibly with retrospective effect, describe only the UK (i) withholding tax treatment of payments in respect of the_
_Notes, and (ii) stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”) treatment of the issue and transfer of the Notes. They are_
_not exhaustive. They do not deal with any other UK taxation implications of acquiring, holding, exchanging, redeeming or_
_disposing of the Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes who are in any doubt as to their tax position or who may be subject_
_to tax in a jurisdiction other than the UK are strongly advised to consult their own professional advisers._

So long as the Notes are and continue to be admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF
Market and are admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (which is a “recognised stock exchange” for
the purposes of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”)), payment of interest on the Notes may be made without
withholding or deduction for or on account of income tax.

Interest on the Notes may also be paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of tax where at the time the
payment is made, the Issuer (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes is paid) reasonably believes that
(a) the person beneficially entitled to the interest is a UK resident company or a non-UK resident company that carries on a
trade in the UK through a permanent establishment and the payment is one that the non-UK resident company is required to
bring into account when calculating its profits subject to UK corporation tax, or (b) the person to whom the payment is made
is one of the further classes of bodies or persons, and meets any relevant conditions, set out in sections 935-937 of the ITA,
provided in each case HMRC has not given a direction, the effect of which is that the payment may not be made without that
withholding or deduction.

In other cases, absent any other relief or exemption (such as a direction by HMRC that interest may be paid without
withholding or deduction for or on account of tax to a specified holder of the Notes following an application by that holder of
the Notes under an applicable double tax treaty), an amount must generally be withheld on account of income tax at the basic
rate (currently 20 per cent.) from payments of interest on the Notes.

Where Notes are issued on terms that a premium is or may be payable on redemption, as opposed to being issued at a
discount, then it is possible that any such element of premium may constitute a payment of interest and be subject to
withholding on account of income tax as outlined in the preceding paragraphs.

Where Notes are issued at an issue price of less than 100 per cent. of their principal amount, any payments in respect of
the accrued discount element on any such Notes will not be made subject to any withholding or deduction for or on account
of income.

Where interest has been paid under deduction of income tax, holders of the Notes who are not resident in the United
Kingdom may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted under an appropriate provision of an applicable double
taxation treaty.

The references to “interest” above are to “interest” as understood for the purposes of United Kingdom tax law. They do
not take into account any different definition of “interest” that may prevail under any other tax law or that may apply under
the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related document.

**Payments by a Guarantor**

If payments by a Guarantor under the Guarantee were not treated as having a UK source they should not be subject to
UK withholding tax. If this were not the case then, depending on the correct legal analysis of the payments as a matter of UK
tax law (which is uncertain), it is possible that any payments by a Guarantor would be subject to UK withholding tax at the
basic rate (currently 20 per cent.), subject to any claim which could be made under applicable double tax treaties or any other
available exemption and reliefs, including an exemption for certain payments to which a company within the charge to UK
corporation tax is beneficially entitled.

**Information Reporting**

Information relating to securities (including in relation to interest or payments treated as interest and payments derived
from securities) may be required to be provided to HMRC in certain circumstances. This may include the value of the Notes,
details of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes (or the persons for whom the Notes are held), details of the persons to
whom payments derived from the Notes are or may be paid and information in connection with transactions relating to the
Notes. Information may be required to be provided by, among others, the holders of the Notes, persons by (or via) whom
payments derived from the Notes are made or who receive (or would be entitled to receive) such payments, persons who
effect or are a party to transactions relating to the Notes on behalf of others and certain registrars or administrators.

In certain circumstances, the information obtained by HMRC may be provided to tax authorities in other countries.


-----

**Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax**

No UK stamp duty or SDRT is payable on the issue, or on a transfer, of the Notes.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
effects. The discussion is limited to considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except to the extent
discussed in “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,” and does not address the effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as
estate and gift tax laws, or any state, local or foreign tax laws. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”), judicial decisions,
and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in
effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or
differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have
not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the
IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash
at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at
which a substantial amount of the applicable series of Notes is sold to the public for cash). This discussion does not address
all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the
Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject
to special rules, including, without limitation:

    - U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

    - persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;

    - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

    - persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion
transaction or other integrated investment;

    - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

    - real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies;

    - brokers, dealers and traders in securities;

    - “controlled foreign corporations”, “passive foreign investment companies”, and corporations that accumulate
earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

    - S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and investors therein);

    - tax-exempt organisations and governmental organisations; and

    - persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, is:

 an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

 a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or
organised under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

 an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

 a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid
election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain
determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding the Notes and the partners in such partnerships
should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.


-----

THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. INVESTORS
SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISERS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL
INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE
PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX
LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S.
TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.

**_Characterisation of the Notes_**

Under certain circumstances, the Notes provide for payments in excess of stated interest and principal and/or
redemption prior to their stated maturity. The Issuer intends to take the position that these provisions will not cause the Notes
to be subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules of applicable Treasury Regulations (the “CPDI Rules”). This
position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the issue date, that such additional amounts will have
to be paid and relating to the expected yield to maturity of the Notes. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. Holder,
unless the U.S. Holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. The Issuer’s position is
not, however, binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenged the Issuer’s position, the tax consequences of owning
and disposing of the Notes could be materially different than those described herein, including with respect to the character,
timing and amount of income, gain or loss recognised. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes are not
subject to the CPDI Rules, but there can be no assurances in this regard. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax
advisers regarding the potential application to the Notes of the CPDI Rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of stated interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and
without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary
income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the
pound sterling interest payment (determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received) regardless of
whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. Holder will not recognise exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of such stated interest, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of
the pounds sterling received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to
include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in pound sterling that
has accrued with respect to the Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such pounds sterling denominated
accrued stated interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate for the accrual period or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period within each taxable
year. An accrual method U.S. Holder may elect to translate such accrued stated interest income into U.S. dollars using the
spot rate on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using
the spot rate on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the relevant taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day
of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued stated interest, a U.S. Holder that has
made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest using the spot rate on the date of receipt of the
stated interest. The above election will apply to all other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. Holder or subsequently
acquired and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognise exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued stated interest on the date
such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognised will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar value of the pound sterling payment received (determined based on the spot rate on the date such stated interest is
received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income that has accrued during such
accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time.
Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit
purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss below, stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute
foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit
allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s
ability to claim foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu thereof). U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding
the creditability or deductibility of any foreign taxes withheld.


-----

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will
recognise U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realised upon such disposition (less any
amount attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as such to the extent not previously included
in income as described above under “—Payments of stated interest”) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

The amount realised by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the cash plus the fair market value of all other property received on
the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on a sale or other taxable disposition of a
Note, the amount realised will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated into U.S. dollars at the
spot rate on the date of disposition. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and
an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate in
effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder makes this election, the election must be
applied consistently by such holder from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis
U.S. Holder that has not made the settlement date election will recognise exchange gain or loss (as U.S. source ordinary
income or loss) to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received (based on the spot rate on the date of
settlement) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised (based on the spot rate on the date of disposition).

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be its cost for the Note. The cost of a Note purchased with
foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price based on the spot rate on the date of purchase.

A U.S. Holder will recognise exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the sale or other taxable
disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the
Note on (i) the date of sale or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In
addition, upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realise exchange gain or loss attributable to
amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—
_Payments of stated interest”. Any such exchange gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued_
interest) will be realised only to the extent of the total gain or loss realised on the sale or other taxable disposition by a U.S.
Holder, and will generally be treated as U.S. source income or loss.

Gain or loss in excess of exchange gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognises on the sale or other taxable disposition of the
Notes generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a
U.S. Holder has held the Notes for more than one year. For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains are generally
eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder should
consult its own tax adviser regarding the deductibility of capital losses in its particular circumstances.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest on the Notes and to the proceeds of
the sale or other disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a Note paid to a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder
is an exempt recipient and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. A U.S. Holder that is not an exempt
recipient may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding at the applicable rate (currently 28 per cent.) with respect to
payments on the Notes and the proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes, unless the U.S. Holder provides
its taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and certifies on IRS Form W-9, under penalties of perjury, that it is not
subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding withheld from a payment to a U.S.
Holder may be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such U.S.
Holder to a refund, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes, as described under “Description of Notes”. These Additional Notes, even if
they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as either series of original Notes, in some cases may be treated
as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have been
issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Tax return disclosure requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in
excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on a foreign currency note or a sale or other
taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. Holders
should consult their tax advisers to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the
Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).


-----

Individuals (and certain entities) that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of
certain thresholds generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The
Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are
held in an account at certain financial institutions. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the
application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for
non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to certain provisions of the Code, commonly known as FATCA, a “foreign financial institution” may be
required to withhold on certain payments it makes (“foreign passthru payments”) to persons that fail to meet certain
certification, reporting, or related requirements. The Issuer may be a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A
number of jurisdictions (including the jurisdiction of the Issuer) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to,
intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (“IGAs”), which modify the way in which
FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an
IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes. Certain
aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether
withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the
Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA
with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to 1 January 2019 and
Notes issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final regulations defining “foreign passthru
payments” are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” for purposes of FATCA withholding
unless materially modified after such date (including by reason of a substitution of the Issuer). However, if Additional Notes
that are not distinguishable from a previously issued series of Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering
period and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all Notes of such series, including the
Notes offered prior to the expiration of the grandfathering period, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Holders should
consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any
withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no person will be
required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

ERISA imposes certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) subject to Title I of ERISA and on entities that are
deemed to hold the assets of such plans (“ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA
Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the
requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in
accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA
Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as
individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”)) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest,”
within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code)
having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A
party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the
applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to
such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a prohibited transaction or
any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA.

Non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA)
and certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code), while not subject to the
fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local, federal or other laws, rules or regulations that are substantially
similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code (collectively, “Similar Law”). Fiduciaries of any such plans
should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of
any exempted relief under any such law or regulations.

**_Prohibited Transaction Exemptions_**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether
such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or a disqualified
person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the
transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets. Such parties in interest
or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent or
any of their respective affiliates. Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions, which may include the identification of
the Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire and/or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code or Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 (relating to transactions
effected by an “independent qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance
company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60
(relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an inhouse asset manager) (collectively, the “Class Exemptions”) could provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that any of these Class Exemptions
or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

Each Plan fiduciary (and each fiduciary for non-U.S., governmental or church plans subject to Similar Law) should
consult with its legal adviser concerning the potential consequences to the Plan under ERISA, the Code or such Similar Laws
of an investment in the Notes.

**_Representation and Warranty_**

By its purchase of any Note, the purchaser and any subsequent transferee thereof will be deemed to have represented
and warranted that either: (i) it is not a Plan and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and
hold the Notes constitutes assets of any Plan or non-U.S., governmental or church plan subject to Similar Law or any entity
whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 2510.3-101 of Title 29 of the
United States Code of Federal Regulations, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) of any such plan, account or
arrangement or (ii) the purchase and holding of the Notes by such purchaser or transferee does not and will not constitute a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any
applicable Similar Law.


-----

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of**
**these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in prohibited transactions, it is particularly**
**important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering whether to purchase the Notes offered hereby on behalf of or**
**with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of**
**the Code and any Similar Laws to such transaction and whether an exemption would be applicable to such**
**transaction. Investors in the Notes offered hereby have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase of the**
**Notes does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or any similar provisions of**
**Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes offered hereby by or to any Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of**
**our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to**
**investments by such Plans generally, or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for such Plans**
**generally or any particular Plan.**


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Initial Purchasers are, Barclays Bank PLC, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Merrill Lynch International and Lloyds
Bank plc. The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from us,
pursuant to a purchase agreement between the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers (the “Purchase Agreement”),
the entire principal amount of the Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes
from us, are several and not joint.

**General**

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this
Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling
terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates, who are
qualified broker-dealers under applicable law, including in respect of sales into the United States.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the
Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our counsel.

**No Sale of Similar Securities**

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may
be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions as provided under the Purchase
Agreement, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the date the Notes
are issued, to not, and to cause our subsidiaries to not, without having received the prior written consent provided for in the
Purchase Agreement, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by us or any
of our subsidiaries.

**Securities Not Being Registered Under the U.S. Securities Act**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold within the United States except to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and outside the United States to nonU.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Terms used
in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under
“Notice to Investors.” Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the acknowledgments, representations,
warranties and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors”.

**United Kingdom**

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating
to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order
2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth
companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the UK, or (iv) are persons
to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) in
connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated
(all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant
persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity
to which this offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant
persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents.

Each of the Initial Purchasers has represented, warranted and agreed that:

    - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated
an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA)
received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the
FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and

    - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in
relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK.

**Other Jurisdictions**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the
European Economic Area will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to


-----

publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. The expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended),
and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Member State concerned.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the UK, by us or the Initial Purchasers
that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum
or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the
Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering
material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer
or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform
themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering
memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Resale Restriction**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or
disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbours of
Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**New Issue of Securities**

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We will apply, through our Listing
Agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to have the Notes admitted for trading on
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law.
The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be
discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(“U.S. Exchange Act”).

Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favourable to you. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and Our Capital Structure—Holders of the Notes may not be able to resell the_
_Notes easily, an active liquid trading market for the Notes may not develop or may be volatile and no assurance can be made_
_regarding the prices at which holders of the Notes might be able to resell the Notes”._

**Price Stabilisation**

In connection with this Offering, Barclays Bank PLC (or persons acting on its behalf) or one of its affiliates (the
“Stabilising Manager”) may over-allot the Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the
Notes during the stabilisation period at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilisation action
may not necessarily occur. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the
terms of the offer of the Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than 30 days after the
date on which the issuer received the proceeds of the issue, or no later than 60 days after the date of allotment of the Notes,
whichever is the earlier. Any stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the relevant Stabilising Manager (or
persons acting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules and will be undertaken at the offices of the
Stabilising Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) and on the Euro MTF of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

**Initial Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the
cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1
of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business
days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on
the date of this Offering Memorandum or during the following six business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such
trades should consult their own advisers.


-----

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may
include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment management, principal investment,
hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have
provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, commercial purpose lending, treasury management,
corporate broker, transaction and clearing services, consulting and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates in the
ordinary course of business for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and expense reimbursement.
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and
securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates. The
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes. In connection with the Offering, the Initial
Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than the Issuer. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are
lenders under (i) the Bridge Facility (and as a result will receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes) and
(ii) the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and are expected to be lenders under the New Revolving Facility. Moreover, the
Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are or may, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to certain of our
hedging arrangements consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps
or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of Notes. In addition, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities plc is the corporate broker of Drax Group
plc. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY**

The following is a brief description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and
security interests for the Notes and of certain aspects of insolvency law in each of the jurisdictions in which the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the providers of security in respect of the Notes are organised. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer,
the Guarantors, the providers of security in respect of the Notes or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to know with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security to the Notes. The descriptions below are only a
summary and do not purport to be complete or discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the Notes, the
Guarantees or other security interests.

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organised under the laws of Member States of the EU. Pursuant to Council
Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the EU
(other than Denmark), the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, “COMI”) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings
(“main proceedings”). The determination of where a company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the
different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Although under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its
COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the
COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular
basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third-parties”. The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in
determining the COMI of a company, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location in which the
company conducts the majority of its business and/or has its head office and the location in which the majority of the
company’s creditors are established. A company’s COMI may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of
deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation
at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of the
types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

If the COMI of a company is in one Member State, under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of
another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings only in the event that such
debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined in the EU
Insolvency Regulation to mean a place of operations where the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with
human means and goods. The effects of those insolvency proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor located in the
territory of such other Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its COMI, any proceedings
opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company has an establishment (“secondary proceedings”) are
limited to “winding up proceedings” listed in Annex B to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the
Member State in which the company has its COMI have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be
opened in another Member State in which the company has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot
be opened in the Member State in which the company’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law or (b) the territorial
insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office
in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court opening the main
proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been
opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because
the company’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the law of that Member State in another Member
State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no
insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been
taken further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

The EU Insolvency Regulation has been replaced by Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the
Council dated May 20, 2015 (the “New EU Insolvency Regulation”) which became effective as of 26 June, 2015, and which
will be applicable to insolvency proceedings opened after 26 June 2017. The EU Insolvency Regulation remains applicable to
insolvency proceedings opened before that date.


-----

The New EU Insolvency Regulation includes, among others, specifications regarding the identification of the COMI.
Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, in the case of a company or legal person, the COMI is
presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall
only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the
request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the COMI being at the place of the
registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in another Member State than the one
where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner
that is ascertainable by third-parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and the centre of the
management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to
creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the
COMI, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due
course (e.g. by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new
location public through other appropriate means). Another change under the New EU Insolvency Regulation focuses on the
definition of “establishment” as a prerequisite to open “territorial proceedings” (secondary proceedings). From 26 June, 2017
onwards, “establishment” will mean any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month
period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and
assets.

In the event that the Issuer or any Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty
in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors.
The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organised or operate
may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the
potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**England and Wales**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors (the “English Guarantors” and the Guarantees provided by the English
Guarantors being, the “English Guarantees”) are companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore,
any main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or an English Guarantor would likely be commenced in England.

However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where an English company conducts business in another Member
State of the EU, the jurisdiction of the English courts may be limited if the company’s COMI is found to be in another
Member State (see “—European Union”). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the COMI.
The COMI should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis
and is therefore ascertainable by third-parties. The place of the registered office of the company is presumed to be the COMI
in the absence of proof to the contrary. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant
insolvency proceedings are opened. Similarly, the U.K. Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the
UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the UK, provide that a foreign (i.e., non-European) court may have
jurisdiction where any English company has its COMI in such foreign jurisdiction or where it has an “establishment” (being a
place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and
assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

English insolvency law may not be as favourable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United States or other
jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that an English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to an English company should be commenced in England based
on English insolvency laws, although (as noted above) insolvency proceedings in respect of English companies could also be
based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances.

Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial or secondary proceedings may be commenced against a Guarantor
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales in other Member States (except Denmark) even if the COMI is in
England, provided that the company has an establishment within the territory of that other Member State. The effects of these
proceedings would be restricted to the assets of such Guarantor situated in that Member State.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including
by a Guarantor’s directors or a creditor making an application for administration, in or (in the case of such Guarantor’s
directors or any creditors holding security over all or substantially all of such Guarantor’s assets under a qualifying floating
charge) out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up such Guarantor or such Guarantor’s shareholders resolving to
do so (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into


-----

administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve
one of three statutory purposes.

Under the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay
its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they
fall due) which test can be demonstrated, for example, where a company fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a
debt exceeding £750 or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order), or if it is insolvent on a “balance
sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and
prospective liabilities).

**_Fixed and floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security, including
(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use
cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the
charging company’s business) while in administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed
charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged
assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable
out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge
claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating
charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging
company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and meaning that there is a risk of
security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) floating charge security is subject to
certain challenges under English insolvency law (please see “—Challenges to guarantees and security—Grant of floating
_charge”); and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension_
scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing (please see “Administration and floating
_charges”)._

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterise fixed security interests purported to be created
by a security document as floating charges, and the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative.
Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will
depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to
deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the charge in practice.
Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallisation, the court
is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as
a fixed charge in the security documents.

**_Administration and floating charges_**

The relevant English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of an
English company in certain circumstances. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant
company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve
the purpose of administration. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder
of a qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. In general, during
the administration, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor or security
enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of
a company in administration may be able to realise their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory
moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement”
(generally, cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If an English Guarantor were to enter administration, it is
possible that, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted
by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of the court or consent of the administrator. In
addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference
to an administrator, and any already appointed receiver must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the
company is already in administration no receiver may be appointed.

In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the
floating charge granted by the relevant English Guarantor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for purposes of
English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge
must, unless the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to
the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating
charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to


-----

empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrative receiver within the meaning given by section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The Security Agent will be the
holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security
interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English Guarantor’s property and at least one such
security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an
administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangement” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which
will apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life of the
arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act
but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or
liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating
charge security (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses (floating charge realisations)) for the
benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of floating charge
realisations and 20 per cent. of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the assets
that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English
Guarantor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a winding-up procedure applicable to companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
There are three ways an English guarantor may be placed into liquidation or “wound up”: (1) Members’ Voluntary
Liquidation (which is a procedure available to solvent companies only); (2) Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation; and
(3) Compulsory Winding-Up.

On the liquidation of an English company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place preventing the holders
of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests. Where a company incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales is placed into liquidation, a creditor holding a valid mortgage, charge or other security interest has four
options: (1) to realise the security, apply the proceeds towards discharge of the secured debt, and prove in the liquidation for
any balance; (2) to retain the security and not prove in the liquidation; (3) to value the security and prove for any shortfall
between that value and the value of the debt; or (4) to surrender the security and prove for the full amount of the debt.

_Priority of Claims_

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the
possible functions of administration) under English law is to realise the assets of the insolvent company and to distribute the
realisations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act, creditors are placed into different classes and,
with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property
applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below),
distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in
full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

    - First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the
possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent of the realisations from
those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest;

    - Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there
is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which expenses are paid);

    - Third ranking claims: These are divided into ordinary preferential creditors and secondary preferential creditors with
ordinary preferential creditors being paid in priority to secondary preferential creditors. Preferential debts include
(but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and
state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been
terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date;

    - Fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security to the extent of the realisations from those secured assets,
according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed
charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge.
However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined
below) must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;


-----

    - Fifth ranking claims: general unsecured creditors. However, any secured creditor not repaid in full from the
realisation of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it (a shortfall) from the insolvent
estate as an unsecured claim; and

    - Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the subordination (provided that such terms do not
contravene the Insolvency Act).

_Prescribed Part_

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of an English company will be required to
ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of assets subject to floating charge security for the benefit of
unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this applies to 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net floating
charge realisations and 20 per cent. of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate
cap of £600,000. The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of
secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors’ claims in full.

**_Challenges to guarantees and security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and
guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation
within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an
administrator or liquidator is appointed in respect of an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the
validity of the guarantee or security given by such company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and charges:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation
of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. There will only be a transaction at an
undervalue if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was or became unable to pay
its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation
or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or
the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift
to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in
money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. A court, however, generally will not intervene if it
is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that,
at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that
the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what
it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator
to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as
defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must
demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation
of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. There will only be a preference if, at the time of the
transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was or became unable to pay its debts (as defined in the
Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or
two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company grants the security interest or the
guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a
surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into
insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been
entered into. A court is unlikely to make an order in respect of a preference unless it is satisfied the company was influenced
in deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better position” for the relevant person. Case law suggests there must be a
desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of


-----

producing the better position. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court has very wide powers for
restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing
payments under the Notes and the Guarantees in this instance (although there is protection for a third-party who enters into a
transaction in good faith and without notice). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that
the English company was insolvent and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless
the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (other than by being an employee), in which case there is a
presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must
demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

The Issuer cannot assure holders of the Notes that, in the event of insolvency, the granting of the security or the giving
of the Guarantees by companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales would not be challenged by a liquidator
or administrator or that a court would support our analysis that (in any event) the security and Guarantees were entered into
in good faith for the purposes described above. If a court were to avoid any grant of security or giving of any Guarantee as a
result of a transaction at an undervalue or preference, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you would cease to have
any security over the grantor or a claim against the Guarantor giving such Guarantee.

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for the
purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of
otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim that person is making or may make, the transaction may
be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a
“victim” of the transaction (with leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore
limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in English insolvency law within which the challenge must be
made (although general statutory limitation periods will apply) and the relevant company does not need to be unable to pay
its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) or become unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction. If the court
determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore
the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims
of the transaction.

_Extortionate credit transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply for a court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can
review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English Guarantor up to three years before the day on which the
English Guarantor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the
risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to
be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly
contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

_Grant of floating charge_

Under English insolvency law, if an English Guarantor is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of)
granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then such
floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any
discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Guarantor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating
charge. The requirement for the English Guarantor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge
does not apply where the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below and is granted to a
connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the
specified period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or
goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Guarantor at the same time as
or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant English Guarantor is solvent or insolvent. The granting of the
charge can be challenged only if the relevant English Guarantor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a
period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from
the date the relevant English Guarantor grants the floating charge. However, if a floating charge qualifies as a “security
financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003, the floating charge
will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator or a liquidator, as applicable, does not need
to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created during the relevant time
period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any
discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating
charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.


-----

_Limitation on Enforcement_

The grant of a guarantee by an English Guarantor in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy
certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum
and articles of association. To the extent that these do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee
is found to be void and the beneficiary’s rights in respect of such guarantee will be unenforceable. Some comfort may be
obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with an English guarantor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not
without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English guarantor in question
by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act provides that a director must act in the
way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English guarantor for the benefit of
its members as a whole. If a company’s directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit,
they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

_Foreign Currency_

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the officeholder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate for each currency determined
by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant date. If a creditor considers the rate to be
unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

_Schemes of Arrangement_

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or
arrangement between a company and its creditors (or classes of creditors) where such company (i) is liable to be wound up
under the Insolvency Act; and (ii) has “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

In practice, in addition to applying to English companies, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test
and the second limb has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where, among other things, the company has assets
situated in England, the company’s centre of main interests is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law
governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English
law. The law in this area is being closely considered by the English courts and the fact that the second limb has been found to
be satisfied in such cases previously does not necessarily mean that this limb will be satisfied in all such cases as each case
will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be
affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise or
arrangement can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing more 75 per cent. or more
in value of those creditors present and voting at the creditor’s meeting of each class vote in favour of the proposed
compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that compromise will be
binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of
arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at
a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has
the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to
the scheme, or reject the scheme.

**United States**

**_Fraudulent transfer_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws,
the transfer of an interest in property or the incurrence of an obligation, including the incurrence of the obligations under the
Notes, the issuance of the Guarantees and the grant of security, whether now or in the future, by the Issuers and the
Guarantors (together, the “Obligors”) could be avoided, if, among other things, at the time the Obligors made such transfer
or incurred such obligation, the Obligors (i) intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor or (ii) received
less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the transfer or obligation and:

    - were insolvent on the date the transfer was made or obligation incurred or were rendered insolvent by the transfer or
obligation;

    - were engaged in a business or transaction or about to be engaged in a business or transaction for which the Obligors’
remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as they mature.


-----

**_Preference_**

Any future grant of security interest with regard to the Collateral in favour of the Notes, including pursuant to security
documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable in a U.S. bankruptcy case by the grantor (as debtorin-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a preference if certain events or circumstances exist or occur (subject to
exceptions), including, among others, the grantor is insolvent at the time of the grant, a bankruptcy case in respect of the
grantor is commenced within 90 days following the grant (or in certain circumstances, a longer period) and the security
interest permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the bankruptcy case were a case under Chapter 7
of the Bankruptcy Code and the security had not been granted.

**_Other actions_**

As a court of equity, a U.S. bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or other claims against
us under the principle of equitable subordination, if the U.S. bankruptcy court determines that: (i) the holder of Notes
engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or
conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of Notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_The automatic stay_**

The right of a holder of the Notes to enforce its security interests against the Obligors upon the occurrence of an event
of default under the Indenture governing the Notes is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable U.S. bankruptcy law if
one or more of the Obligors becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon the commencement of a case
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as a holder of Notes, is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from commencing or continuing any act to obtain possession of or exercise control over
property of the bankruptcy estate, including any Collateral. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the
Obligors could therefore prevent the holders of the Notes from obtaining possession or exercising control over the Collateral
or commencing any action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the Collateral. The automatic stay could
be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, but parties may object to any creditor’s request
to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court may deny such a request.

**_Right of debtor-in-possession to remain in control of collateral and the bankruptcy process_**

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its property
and is authorised to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession,” subject to certain limitations. This remains
the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a chapter 7 liquidation under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, in which case a chapter 11 trustee or chapter 7 trustee remains in possession of the debtor’s property.
Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in
default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that, upon the secured creditor’s request, the secured creditor is given
“adequate protection” of its interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting
other relief, in each case to the extent that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in such collateral decreases during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition
of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A
U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to adequate protection for a decrease in the value
of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures.

Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a plan
within the first 120 days of the case or its plan has not been accepted within the first 180 days of the case by each class of
claims or interests that is impaired under the plan. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods for cause upon
request of a party in interest. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the
180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other
parties, such as secured creditors, would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans.

In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” the exclusive periods,
and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

    - whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests;

    - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed or
confirmed; or

    - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of
the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection”.

**_A debtor-in-possession may obtain new credit secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens_**

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an extension of new
credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts and circumstances,
authorise the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or
equal to existing liens, provided that, among other things, there is adequate protection of the interests of the holders of the
existing liens. In other words, it is possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such
Obligor or Obligors would be permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens that exist
at the time of the chapter 11 filing.

**_Post-petition interest_**

Any future bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors could possibly assert that the fair
market value of the Collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current
principal amount of the Notes. Upon a finding by a bankruptcy court that the Notes are under-collateralised, the claims in the
bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and
the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. In the event of a U.S. bankruptcy case,
the holders of the Notes will be entitled to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code only if the value of their
security interest in the Collateral is greater than their pre-bankruptcy claim. Holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an
unsecured claim if the obligation under the Notes equals or exceeds the fair market value of the Collateral securing the Notes.
Holders of the Notes that have a security interest in the Collateral with a value equal to or less than their pre-bankruptcy
claim may not be entitled to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Ability to confirm a chapter 11 plan notwithstanding the dissenting votes of creditors_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can be imposed on a creditor or equityholder (or class of creditors
or equityholders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims
asserted against the debtor and the property of the bankruptcy estate and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment
of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the
plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the
plan and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interests that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to
vote on the plan and are deemed to reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if creditors holding at least twothirds in amount and more than one half in number of the claims of such class accept the plan. A plan can be confirmed by
the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or
more impaired classes reject the plan, the plan may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in
accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which require, among other things, that one
impaired class has accepted the plan and that the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to
each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the debtor or other
plan proponent to confirm its plan over the objection of one or more dissenting classes.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The historical consolidated financial statements of Drax Group plc and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the
years ended 31 December 2015 and 2016 have been audited by Deloitte LLP, independent auditors, as set forth in their
reports appearing herein. The independent auditors’ reports for those accounting periods were unqualified. Deloitte LLP is
registered with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (the “ICAEW”) to carry out audit work, and is
regulated and supervised by that body.

The consolidated non-statutory financial statements of Opus Energy Group Limited and its subsidiaries as of 31 March

KPMG LLP has given and not withdrawn its consent for its reports to be included in this Offering Memorandum. Such
consent is different from a consent filed with the SEC under Section 7 of the U.S. Securities Act, which is applicable only to
transactions involving securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act. As the Notes have not been and will not be
registered under the U.S. Securities Act, KPMG has not filed a consent under Section 7 of the U.S. Securities Act.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a company organised under the laws of England and Wales, and certain of the Guarantors of the Notes
have been incorporated in England and Wales and Delaware. The majority of the directors and executive officers of the
Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. In addition, the majority of the assets of the Issuer and the
non-U.S. Guarantors are located outside the United States. Although the Issuer and the non-U.S. Guarantors will appoint an
agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, in
each case in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may not be able to effect service of process on such
persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors within the United States in any action, including actions predicated on civil liability
provisions of the U.S. federal and state securities laws or other laws.

**England and Wales**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England and Wales is
based upon advice provided to us by U.S. and English legal advisers. The United States and England currently do not have a
treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration
awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court
in the U.S. based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognised and/or enforced in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England
and Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an
action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject
to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is
no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional
upon (among other things) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles
and rules of English private international law;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court
which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

    - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998;

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a
penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law;

    - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice;

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court in respect of the same matter involving the
same parties; and

    - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be
enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is able to utilise any method or methods
of enforcement available to him/her at the time. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to
enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor
has any set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will
be recognised and/or enforced in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United
States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Summary of our audit approach**

Key risks The key risks that we identified in the current year were:

– Asset impairment

– Useful economic life assumptions

– Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts

– Existence and valuation of biomass stocks

– Valuation and recoverability of ROCs

Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £4.2 million which was determined based on a blended basis taking into
consideration a number of available metrics.

Scoping We focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at three locations, being Drax Power, Haven Power and Drax Biomass.
All of these were subject to a full scope audit. These three locations represent the principal business units and account for all of the
group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax.

Significant changes in our approach Our audit approach remains consistent to the prior year. We have refined our key risk in relation to stocks and have focused specifically
on biomass existence and valuation and identified a new risk in relation to the useful economic life assumptions adopted.

**Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group**


We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

– the directors’ confirmation on page 61 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group,
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
– the disclosures on pages 55 to 61 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;

– the directors’ statement on page 111 about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over
a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
– the directors’ explanation on page 54 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done
so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation
that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment,
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

**112**


We confirm that we have nothing
material to add or draw attention to
in respect of these matters.

We agreed with the directors’ adoption
of the going concern basis of accounting
and we did not identify any such material
uncertainties. However, because not
all future events or conditions can
be predicted, this statement is not a
guarantee as to the group’s ability
to continue as a going concern.


-----

**Independence**

We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and confirm that we are
independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.


We confirm that we are independent of
the group and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance
with those standards. We also confirm
we have not provided any of the
prohibited non-audit services referred
to in those standards.


**Our assessment of risks of material misstatement**
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

This year we have refined the risk relating to stocks to focus on the existence and valuation of biomass stocks, as opposed to coal and biomass
stocks in the prior year as this is where we consider the most judgement to exist. As per note 3.3, biomass stocks have increased from £119 million
at 31 December 2015 to £198 million at 31 December 2016. Coal stocks have reduced from £89 million at 31 December 2015 to £66 million at
31 December 2016. This reflects the development of the plant.

Useful economic life assumptions has been identified as a new risk in the year. As part of the most recent annual review of asset lives, the estimated
useful life of coal-specific assets at Drax Power Station will be revised with effect from 1 January 2017 and this is considered to be a key judgement.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk


Asset Impairment
The Group’s market capitalisation continues to be below its asset value. Additional
contributing factors in the current year which increase the risk of impairment includes
the depreciation of sterling following the Brexit vote, delays in the approval of the CfD,
the UK Government consultation on the future of coal generating assets within the UK
power industry and continued softness in commodity markets. Management has
therefore performed an impairment review in the current year.

As noted in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in
note 2.4 and the Audit Committee report on page 77, asset impairment has been
considered a key risk by the Audit Committee.

The impairment testing is subject to the application of management judgement in
identifying cash-generating units (CGUs) and various assumptions underlying the
calculation of the value in use for each CGU identified. This assessment also considers
changes in the business which may give rise to additional CGUs, for example the
approval of the CfD on Unit 1 in the current year.

Additionally, these assumptions include the achievability of the long-term business
plan and related modelling assumptions underlying the valuation process.

The significant judgements have been disclosed by management in note 2.4 and include:

– The expected operating lives of the six generating units

– Future commodity prices beyond the horizon of existing contracted purchases,
particularly long-term power prices at both baseload and peak times, and biomass
prices in the long term given that biomass is not a standardised commodity traded
openly on exchanges;
– Future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of existing contracted purchase
commitments;
– the continuance of existing biomass support regimes until 2027 and the existence
of a favourable economic environment for biomass generation thereafter; and
– The discount rate applied to forecast future cash flows.

Useful economic life assumptions
Previously, the useful economic life of the power station was assumed to end in 2039.
Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and
other available evidence; however an inherent degree of judgement remains.

As per note 3.1, as part of the most recent annual review of asset lives, the estimated
useful life of coal-specific assets at Drax Power Station will be revised with effect from
1 January 2017. On 9 November 2016 the Government announced a consultation on
the future closure of unabated coal-fired generation. Following this, management
concluded that coal generation will most likely cease during 2025, shortening the
useful lives of the coal-specific assets which will not be required to support generation
after this date.

Management believe this change will result in an increase of approximately £27 million
per annum in depreciation charges from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2025.


We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key controls related to
asset impairment.

We have challenged management’s identification of CGUs, taking into consideration
the independence of cash flows across key components of the business and
generating units.

We utilised our valuation specialists to benchmark key market related assumptions
including commodity prices, current and future capacity and other support
mechanisms and discount rates against external data where available. For example, we
have compared the commodity price assumptions to the latest available Department
for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS), Department of Energy and
Climate Change (DECC) and National Grid forecasts.

We have considered the liquidity of the biomass market and the impact that Drax could
have on that market relating to the volumes of biomass required in the future.

We have also challenged the underlying assumptions and significant judgements used
in management’s impairment model by:

– Running a range of sensitivities to assess whether an impairment would be required
if a range of more conservative assumptions were adopted;
– Assessing the historical accuracy of management’s budgets and forecasts by
comparing them to actual performance and verifying the mathematical accuracy of
the cash flow models; and
– Assessing whether the disclosures in note 2.4 of the financial statements
appropriately disclose the key judgements taken so that the reader of the accounts
is aware of the impact of the financial statement of changes to key assumptions
that may lead to impairment.

We have considered a number of factors as part of our audit including challenging the
reasonableness of key assumptions such as:

– the adequacy of the current and proposed depreciation assumptions across the
generation asset base;
– consideration of the future ability to generate economic value;

– factors affecting primary income streams including forecast spreads and external
factors including political and regulatory requirements; and
– Consistency of the UEL assessment with the impairment analysis above.

We have also assessed whether 1 January 2017 is an appropriate date from which to
amend the useful economic life.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC CONTINUED

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk


Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts
Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in the income statement are
£177m (2015: £124m), with total assets of £891m and liabilities of £364m recognised on
the balance sheet as at the year end. We note that £666m of assets relate to foreign
currency derivatives at the current year end (2015: £36m).

The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas
including the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and assumptions in
respect of future market prices and credit risk factors.

Further detail of the key judgements are disclosure in the Group’s critical accounting
judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on pages 117 and 118 and the Audit
Committee report on page 77.

Existence and valuation of biomass stocks
Biomass stocks of £198 million (2015: £119 million) are held on the balance sheet at year
end. The most significant judgement relating to stock is considered to be the existence
and valuation of biomass stocks held on-site £21 million.

Given the storage and handling characteristics of the on-site biomass stocks, judgement
is inherent in calculating the volume of biomass stocks owned by the Group because it
is not practical to physically count the stocks at year end. Further details of the key
accounting policy judgements are included in note 3.3, and as noted, the calibrated
weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable errors.

The valuation of biomass is dependent upon the estimation or measurement of the
tonnage held, the calorific value, its purchase price and its net realisable value.

The weighted average cost calculation is complex and dependant on the tonnage held.
This results in an increasing risk of management error or bias and therefore increased
risk of misstatement.

Valuation and recoverability of ROCs
ROCs with a value of £258 million are held on the balance sheet at the year end (2015:
£266 million). ROCs are recognised as they are earned through generating electricity
from burning biomass. They are initially recognised at fair value (reducing the cost of
biomass consumed in the income statement) and subsequently written down to net
realisable values as appropriate.

Judgement is required by management in estimating both the initial fair value and
estimating net realisable value, including value recovered through the recycling fund.

Further detail is explained in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and
assumptions set out on pages 117 and 118 and in the Audit Committee report on page 77.


We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key controls related to the
valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts.

We used our financial instrument specialists to test management’s key judgements
and calculations, including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets
confirming key information such as volumes and contracted prices.

We have assessed the valuation models used by management to determine the fair
value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a
sample of both commodity and foreign exchange contracts.

We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve
assumptions by benchmarking these to third party sources and reviewed the
consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the financial statements
such as asset impairment.

We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing
fair value adjustment such as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments.

We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key controls related to the
existence and valuation of on-site biomass stocks.

Our audit procedures include testing the underlying weighted average cost calculation
by agreeing key inputs such as price and volumes to source data including purchase
invoices for amounts delivered in the year. We also sample testing the calorific value of
biomass to third party laboratory reports or purchase invoice as appropriate.

We gained assurance of stock volumes on site during the year through management’s
dome emptying programme. We also sample tested metering data subsequent to the
dome emptying by agreeing to third party sources and internal operational data. We
assessed the tolerable errors in the weighing equipment through agreement to a
sample of third party calibration certificates.

We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key controls related to the
valuation of ROCs.

We gained assurance over the ROCs generated in the year by agreement to Ofgem
confirmation certificates and operational data confirming the level of generation
eligible for ROCs.

We have assessed the initial fair value of ROCs by agreement of the buy-out price to
available third party supporting information and external sales agreements.

We have also challenged the estimates made by management of the recoveries
through the recycling fund, the level of which impacts the estimated net realisable
value of the ROCs held in the balance sheet at year end. This included comparison to
other available third party estimates.


These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Our application of materiality**
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and
in evaluating the results of our work.

When determining materiality, we considered the decline in earnings this year and at present do not consider that this decline is likely to reflect
a long-term reduction in the size and scale of the business.

We have determined materiality by considering a range of possible benchmarks and the figures derived from those, with a particular focus on
selecting a materiality within the range that we considered appropriate. This included underlying EBITDA (excluding unrealised gains or losses on
derivative contracts, one-off asset obsolescence charges and losses on disposal of assets), profit before and after interest and tax as well as the
scale of the balance sheet and the overall size of the business. We determined materiality for the Group on a blended basis to be £4.2 million
(2015: £6.1 million).

This materiality equates to 0.2% of net assets and 17% of underlying profit before tax (excluding unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts,
one-off asset obsolesce charges and losses on disposal of assets). Last year materiality was also based on a blended rate.

**114**


-----

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.2 million (2015: £0.1 million), as
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. The change in the reporting threshold has
been made following our reassessment of what matters require communicating. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

**An overview of the scope of our audit**
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the
risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at
three locations (2015: the same three locations), being Drax Power, Haven Power and Drax Biomass. All of these locations were subject to a full
scope audit and they represent the principal business units and account for all of the group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax, in line with
2015. There were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified
above. Our audit work at three locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than group
materiality and ranged from £2.1 million to £3.8 million (2015: £3.0 million to £4.8 million).

At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there
were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit
or audit of specified account balances.

The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor visits each
of the locations where the group audit scope was focused at least once every two years and the most significant of them at least once a year.
During 2016 the Senior Statutory Auditor visited two of these locations, and other senior team members visited the third.

**Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006;

– the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial statements; and
– the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified
any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**


Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
– the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records
and returns.

Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Our duty to read other information in the Annual report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the
annual report is:

– materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or

– apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the course
of performing our audit; or
– otherwise misleading.

In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during
the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the
annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have
been disclosed.


We have nothing to report in respect of
these matters.

We have nothing to report arising from
these matters.

We have nothing to report arising from
our review.

We confirm that we have not identified
any such inconsistencies or misleading
statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC CONTINUED

**Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor**
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Scope of the audit of the financial statements**
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies
we consider the implications for our report.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

**Introduction**
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed information
about the financial performance (Consolidated income statement),
financial position (Consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows
(Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company)
together with all of the entities controlled by the Company (collectively,
the Group).

The notes to the financial statements provide additional information
on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated
balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes
include explanations of the information presented. In general, the
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is
required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or
other regulations to facilitate increased understanding of the primary
statements set out on pages 120 to 124.

**Basis of preparation**
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS
as adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated
financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been
measured at fair value.

**Going concern**
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments that
may affect its financial performance, position and cash flows, are set
out within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61 of this document.

In the viability statement on page 54 the directors state that they
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next
three years.

Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation
that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months and,
therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these
financial statements.

**Changes in foreign currency exchange rates**
The substantial depreciation of Sterling against the US dollar and
Euro during the second half of 2016 has had a material impact on our
financial statements, resulting in a significant increase in the fair value
of our forward currency purchase contracts in the balance sheet and
income statement volatility due to realised and unrealised currency
exchange gains and losses.

Where the impact is material, we have extended certain disclosures
to highlight the impact of currency exchange gains and losses in
the period. Where relevant, we have re-presented the prior year
comparatives to provide the relevant information to gauge the impact.


**Basis of consolidation**
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the Company,
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. The Company
owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries.

The impact of all intra-Group transactions are eliminated on
consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of
during the year are included in the Consolidated income statement
from the date the Company gains control until the date when the
Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

**Accounting policies**
Those accounting policies that are material to our financial statements
are described in note 8.3 to the financial statements or, where specific
to an individual component of the financial statements, in the relevant
note (see contents on page 119).

We have not changed any of our accounting policies in the period;
however we have adopted a material new policy in respect of
accounting for the Contract for Difference (CfD) (see page 118).

A full listing of new standards, interpretations and pronouncements
under IFRS applicable to these financial statements is presented in
note 8.2. The application of these new requirements has not had a
material effect on the financial statements.

**Judgements, estimates and uncertainties**
The preparation of financial statements requires management to
exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing
basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates
are revised and in any future periods affected.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set
out below and in more detail in the related notes.

**Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**
The judgements that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that
differs from the amount recognised in the financial statements are
as follows:

Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life.
Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future
replacement cycles and other available evidence. However, a degree of
judgement is required. Useful economic lives are reviewed annually, we
reduced the useful lives of certain assets in our generation business
from 1 January 2017.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 3.1 on page 137**

**117**

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually for goodwill
and for other assets and cash-generating units where an indicator of
possible impairment exists. The assessment of future cash flows that
underpins such a review is based on management’s best estimate of
future prices, volumes and economic conditions. The calculations are
particularly sensitive to judgement given the long time period covered
by the assessment.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 2.4 on page 130**

Derivatives – derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
Group’s balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value is
derived from assuming a market price for the instrument in question.
The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon forward curves
that are largely derived from readily obtainable quotations and third
party sources. However, any forward curve is based at least in part
upon assumptions about future transactions and market movements.
Where such instruments extend beyond the liquid portion of the
forward curve, the level of judgement increases as the number of
observable transactions decreases.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 7.2 on page 160**

Inventories – fuel inventories are valued at weighted average cost
based on purchase price, or net realisable value where lower. Valuation
is largely based on observable data (such as invoiced costs and
automated weigher readings). However, given the bulk nature of fuels
an element of judgement is required to assess the volume of stock held
at the balance sheet date.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 3.3 on page 140**

Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) – the carrying amount of
ROCs in the Group’s balance sheet is stated at their expected realisable
value. This assessment is based on estimated future sales prices, which
involves judgement.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 3.2 on page 139**

**Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**
Pensions – the Group records a liability in its balance sheet for its
obligation to provide benefits under an approved defined benefit
pension scheme less the fair value of assets held by the pension
scheme. The actuarial valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities is
performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding interest
rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases, mortality and
other factors.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 6.3 on page 152**

Taxation – in accounting for tax liabilities the Group makes
assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items of income
and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions are based
on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where required,
consultation with external advisors.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 2.6 on page 132**

**118**


Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s activities,
particularly within the Retail segment, results in revenue being based
on the estimated volumes of power supplied to customers at an
estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that underpin these
estimates are applied consistently and comparison of past estimates
to final settlements suggests a high degree of accuracy. However,
given the level of judgement involved, actual outcomes may vary
from initial estimates.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 2.2 on page 127**

CfD accounting policy – the CfD is a material new contract for
the Group and the specific accounting treatment is not prescribed
by an existing IFRS. Accordingly, management has had to exercise
judgement in adopting an appropriate policy in accordance with IAS 8.
Management considered the requirements of a number of standards,
including IAS 18 (revenue), IAS 39 (financial instruments), IAS 16
(leases) and IAS 20 (Government Grants) in determining the policy to
be adopted. In particular, management concluded that the contract
did not meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument in IAS 39
on the grounds that cash flows do not become contractually due
until the point of generation and the Group is under no obligation to
generate. Accordingly, amounts due under the CfD are recognised
at the point of generation.

**MORE INFORMATION: note 2.2 on page 127**

**Non-IFRS measures of financial performance**
We present two non-IFRS measures on the face of our income
statement: EBITDA and underlying profit.

EBITDA is the primary measure we use to assess our financial
performance. EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains and losses on
derivative contracts.

Underlying measures, including underlying profit before and after
tax and underlying earnings per share (EPS), exclude the impact of
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, plus particular
transactions considered to be one-off in nature that do not reflect
the underlying trading and operational performance of the Group.
Underlying profit after tax and EPS exclude the post-tax effect of these
items. In 2015, this excluded an asset obsolescence charge of £109
million. In 2016, this excludes a deferred tax credit of £31 million in
relation to start-up losses in our US business.

A reconciliation of profit for the year attributable to equity holders
(calculated in accordance with IFRS) to underlying profit after tax is
provided in note 2.7.

Under our current distribution policy, dividends are calculated based
upon 50% of underlying profit after tax.

SECTION 2:
## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The financial performance section gives further detail on the information in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a summary of
financial performance by business unit (2.1), analysis of certain income statement items (2.2–2.6) and information regarding underlying earnings,
distributable profits and dividends (2.7–2.9). Further commentary regarding our trading and operational performance during the year, which is
predominantly reflected in EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61, with particular reference to key achievements and
market conditions that have affected our results.

**2.1 Segmental reporting**
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central head office providing certain corporate
functions. Our businesses are:

– Generation: the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station;

– Biomass Supply: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US; and

– Retail: the supply of power to business customers and wood pellets to the domestic heat market.

Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing
performance and making investment decisions is based on these three operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable
segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA (as defined on page 118).

Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Head office costs are
included within central operating costs.

**Segment revenues and results**

Notes:
(1) Adjustments represent the elimination of intra-group transactions.
(2) £102.6 million of the asset obsolescence charges arose in the Generation segment, with the remaining £6.6 in the Biomass Supply segment.

Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis, with no separate reporting by segment in the Group’s management
accounts. However, spend on key capital projects is monitored. Total spend on the biomass transformation project during 2016 was £29 million
(2015: £90 million), of which £7 million (2015: £22 million) relates to construction of assets, in the US, within the Biomass Supply segment.

The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those used in
measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results of all of our reporting segments are
subject to seasonality with higher despatch and prices in the winter months, compared to summer months.

**Intra-group trading**
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arm’s-length, commercial terms that where possible equate to market prices at the time of the
transaction. During 2016, the Biomass Supply segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £72.9 million (2015: £28.4 million) to the Generation
segment and the Generation segment sold power, ROCs and LECs with a total value of £868.2 million (2015: £863.2 million) to the Retail segment.

The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising (£2.3 million at 31 December 2016), is eliminated on consolidation.

**Major customers**
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2016 includes amounts of £541.5 million and £399.3 million (2015: £597.7 million and £468.0 million)
derived from two customers (2015: two customers), each representing 10% or more of the Group’s consolidated revenue for the year. These
revenues arose in the Generation segment.

**126**


-----

**2.2 Revenue**
**Accounting Policy**
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other
sales-related taxes and excluding transactions with or between Group companies.

Revenues from the sale of electricity from our generating assets in Drax Power are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates
specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.

Two of our biomass-fuelled generating units earn Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables Obligation
(RO) regime. The financial benefit of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and
power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet (see note 3.2 on
page 139). Revenue from sale of ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to the account of a third party.

Revenue from the sale of electricity directly to business customers through our power retail business, Haven Power, is recognised on the supply
of electricity when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables
are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based upon metered consumption and contractual rates; however
where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue calculation is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling
price estimates.

Revenues from the sale of wood pellets through our UK domestic pellet retail business, Billington Bioenergy are recognised at the point the
pellets are delivered to the location specified in the contract, which is normally the customer’s premises.

Other revenues derived from the provision of services (for example, the supply of ancillary generation services, such as black start and frequency
response, to National Grid) are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Most such contracts are for the delivery of
a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated with reference to the amount
of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in enhancing probable
future outcomes.

Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) are recognised
at the point the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customer’s premises.

**CfD payments**
The Group is party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with The Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity responsible
for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments in
respect of electricity dispatched from one of its three biomass-fuelled generating units. The payment is calculated with reference to a strike price
of £100 per MWh. The strike price is in 2012 terms and increases each year indexed to UK CPI and system balancing costs. The strike price at
31 December 2016 was £106 per MWh.

Where market prices at the point of generation are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/receives an additional payment to/from
LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price. Such payments are in addition to
amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched
from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.

The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD in the income statement, as a component of revenue, at the point the flow of
economic benefit becomes probable. This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes
contractually due.

The Group began generating under the CfD contract on 21 December 2016 and, in accordance with this policy, accrued £10.3 million of revenue
in respect of amounts due from the LCCC in the period ending 31 December 2016.

**127**

SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUED

**2.2 Revenue continued**
**ROC sales**
The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme started in April 2002 and places an
obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are
certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to suppliers to demonstrate they have fulfilled their obligations
under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 2002.
At 31 December 2016 we are in CP15.

To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set at £30/ROC in
CP1 and rises with inflation. ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price typically slightly
lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle
fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators.

The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected value
to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP. See note
3.2 on page 139 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by our Generation business and those utilised by our Retail business in the year.

Further analysis of our revenue for the year ending 31 December 2016 is provided in the table below:

The Group’s principal revenues arise from the sale of power, both into the wholesale market via Drax Power, our generation business, and to
Industrial and Commercial and small and medium-sized enterprise business customers via Haven Power, our energy retail business. The Group
also sells wood pellets into the domestic UK heat market via Billington Bioenergy, part of our retail business. Drax Biomass, our US-based wood
pellet manufacturing business, generates all of its revenues intra-group, selling sustainable wood pellets to Drax Power to be used in the
electricity generation process.

ROC sales and CfD income reflect revenues received through Government programmes to support renewable generation. ROC sales reflect
consideration received for sales of ROCs by Drax Power to third parties. CfD income reflects amounts received under the CfD contract awarded
by the UK Government to one of our biomass-fuelled electricity generation units. See CfD payments above for further details.

**2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment**
**Accounting policy**
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is an
indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent
cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven Power, Drax Biomass and Billington Bioenergy) and accordingly considers the Group to
be comprised of four CGUs.

If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the present
value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected price that would
be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value). The initial assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value
in use.

Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate
the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs
are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant,
contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities and as a result, the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-tomarket value of those cash flow hedges.

The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential benefit of any
future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using
a pre-tax rate.

If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount
of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2).

**Critical judgement areas**
In 2015, the market capitalisation of the Group fell materially below the carrying value of the Group’s net assets. Whilst the shortfall has reduced
considerably during 2016, this remains the case at the balance sheet date. In addition, commodity markets are weak and the substantial
weakening of Sterling against both the Euro and US dollar in the second half of 2016 indicated a potentially material increase in the long-term
costs of fuel for our generation business, which are predominantly priced in these currencies. Accordingly an impairment review of the Drax
Power CGU was undertaken at the balance sheet date. A review of other CGUs suggested no indicators of impairment.

**130**


-----

**2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment continued**
The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions.
In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon management’s estimates of future prices, output, costs and economic support for
renewable energy generation, including access to Capacity Market and Ancillary Services contracts. Where relevant and to the fullest extent
possible, the key assumptions are based on observable market information. However, observable market information is only available for a
limited proportion of the remaining useful lives of the assets under review,

The most critical of these assumptions are discussed below.

**Impairment review**
The carrying amount of the Drax Power CGU at 31 December 2016 was £1,911 million. The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested using
the Group’s established planning model.

The analysis assumed that Drax Power’s three biomass-fuelled generating units would continue in operation until the end of their estimated
useful lives, currently considered to be 2039. In line with our assumption that coal-fired generation will cease by 2025, applied in light of the
Government consultation published in November 2016, the three remaining coal-fired units were assumed to cease coal-fired generation by
this date but will then be available for conversion to biomass-fired units. No account has been taken of any cash inflows that could result from
such a conversion (which could take place earlier than 2025) in measuring the value in use of the Drax Power CGU.

The analysis depends on a broad range of assumptions, including the expected life of the six power generating units and the regulatory regime
under which they might operate. The key assumptions (i.e. those most sensitive to a change, possibly resulting in a different outcome for
impairment) are considered to be:

– The expected operating lives of the six generating units, as described above;

– Future commodity prices beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase and sale commitments – notably power prices and
biomass prices;
– Future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase commitments; and

– The continuance of existing biomass support regimes – CfD and RO – until 2027 and the existence of a favourable economic environment
for biomass generation thereafter. This includes future Capacity Markets and Ancillary Services revenues.

These assumptions are all dependent on external market movements. The historic volatility in these assumptions is reflected in the financial
performance of the Group but past performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future values.

Where available, estimates of future prices are based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties. Transactions beyond
contracted positions are valued using market data and forward price curves, based where possible on data points provided by a reputable third
party source, independent to the Group. In particular, longer-term power prices are based on Department for Business, Energy and Industrial
Strategy and National Grid assumptions. The contracted period for biomass purchases is substantially longer, with the longest-dated contracts
expiring in 2027. Beyond this point, estimated biomass prices are largely based on our internal models and expectations for the biomass market.

Future foreign exchange rates are based on contracted foreign currency purchases to the extent possible. Beyond our contracted position,
exchange rate estimates are based on market forward curves and, beyond this point, Bloomberg data.

Current Government plans for existing renewable support mechanisms, namely the CfD and RO, assume these cease in 2027. The impairment
analysis made no assumptions regarding the direct replacement of these support mechanisms beyond this date. The biomass-fuelled units
that are assumed to continue to generate power do so supported by the prevailing wholesale power price, delivery of ancillary services to the UK
grid and an expectation that capacity market revenues would be available to these units. Our power price forecasts reflect increased volatility
between peak and baseload prices. Assumed revenues from ancillary services and the capacity market are based on projections derived from
current contracts and capacity market outcomes and how we expect the market to evolve. These assumptions reflect our expectation that Drax
will be required to provide generation to support intermittent renewable power and be an essential part of the UK’s energy mix throughout the
life of the units.

The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax nominal rate of 8.4%. The discount rate is supported by observable market
reports and independent analysis commissioned by, and specific to the circumstances of the Group. This indicated that the recoverable amount
of the Drax Power CGU exceeded its carrying value with headroom of approximately £200 million and therefore that no provisions for impairment
were required.

Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when compared to our base case assumptions, a reduction of approximately 7% in market power prices,
an increase in biomass prices of approximately 11%, or a depreciation of Sterling against the US dollar of some 8% throughout the 23-year term
of the valuation would result in a recoverable amount for the Drax Power CGU that is lower than its carrying amount. This does not consider
the interaction effect of potential changes in several or all of the assumptions simultaneously, and the sensitivities do not take account of any
mitigating actions that could be taken should the changes referred to materialise. In addition, in relation to central costs, no reasonable change
in the method of allocation would result in an impairment charge.

SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CONTINUED

**2.5 Net finance costs**
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bank loans) as well as foreign exchange
gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives (see note 5.3) and net
interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by interest income that we generate
through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds.
Years ended 31 December

Interest payable and similar charges:

Interest payable on bank borrowings (19.4) (18.0)

Unwinding of discount on provisions (note 5.3) (4.5) (0.7)

Amortisation of deferred finance costs (2.1) (3.7)

Net finance cost in respect of defined benefit scheme (note 6.3) (0.9) (1.1)

Interest receivable:

Interest income on bank deposits 0.6 1.4

Total interest receivable 0.6 1.4

Foreign exchange gains 22.0 5.9

Net interest charge (6.4) (17.0)

Foreign exchange gains and losses recognised in interest arise on the retranslation of balances and investments denominated in foreign
currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date. Sterling weakened against the US dollar and Euro following the EU referendum in June,
resulting in gains being recognised on assets the Group holds denominated in these currencies.

Amortisation of deferred finance costs for the previous period include £0.7 million relating to the previous revolving credit facility for which
amortisation was accelerated following the successful renegotiation of a replacement facility in December 2015.

**2.6 Current and deferred taxation**
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable profits
(which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes
and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is
expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules (reflected in differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits). The tax charge reflects
the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 and the movement in the deferred tax
balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

**Accounting policy**
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable
profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that
are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts
expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on
jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. In the UK 2016 Budget, the UK
Government proposed a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 18% to 17% from 1 April 2020. This change was enacted into law
in September 2016 and accordingly these rates have been reflected in the UK deferred tax balance at 31 December 2016.

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income
or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.

**132**


-----

**2.6 Current and deferred taxation continued**
**Significant judgement areas**
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for
deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets
are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business
unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related
deferred tax asset.

UK corporation tax is the main rate of tax for the Group and is calculated at 20% (2015: 20.25%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the
profit per the income statement as follows:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise are shown separately in the
balance sheet.

In the period the Group recognised a net deferred tax asset valued at £34 million in respect of start-up losses and other temporary differences
in the US-based Drax Biomass business (£21 million of this asset relates to losses that arose in previous years). Recognition in 2016 reflects an
improvement in operational performance and the Board’s increased confidence regarding the delivery of future taxable profits against which the
losses will be utilised currently expected by 2027. As a one-off and non-cash item, this credit has been excluded from the calculation of underlying
earnings and the dividend for 2016 (see notes 2.7 and 2.8). These start-up losses are valued at the US Federal tax rate as was enacted at the
balance sheet date (35%). Should Federal tax rates reduce/increase in the future, this will correspondingly reduce/increase (respectively)
this net deferred tax asset.

The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £2 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: £2 million), in respect of UK
losses totalling £12 million, that are carried forward against future taxable income. The business unit involved has a history of making losses and
until sufficient operational performance is established and maintained to give suitable confidence in future profitability, taxable income against
which to utilise the benefit of the accumulated losses is not considered to be probable.

**2.7 Earnings per share and underlying earnings per share**
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that is attributable to each ordinary share we have in issue.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings (profit after tax calculated in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be issued under
our employee share schemes – see note 6.2), that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary
shares as at the balance sheet date.

In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated (note 2.8). Underlying
EPS removes the post-tax effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, plus particular transactions considered to be one-off in
nature that do not reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group, from post-tax profits. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will
give the total dividends per share for the period.

**Distributable profits**
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and cash resources.

The immediate cash resources of the Group of £228.4 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 4.4.
The majority of these cash resources are held by the principal operating subsidiaries of the Group, in particular Drax Power Limited.

The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 167 to 172 of this report, disclose the Parent Company’s distributable reserves of £229
million. The Group has, relative to previous dividend payments (note 2.8), sufficient retained profits, which are accessible by the Parent Company,
for future distributions in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy.

SECTION 3:
## OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL

This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and liabilities,
managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.

**3.1 Property, plant and equipment**
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to generate
revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and is
calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset.
An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.

Additions in 2016 include a further £29 million (2015: £90 million) on our biomass transformation project, which is now largely complete and in line
with initial expectations on timing and overall cost. At Drax Power Station we now have three fully converted units running on biomass fuel, the
third of which completed its conversion following the award of the CfD in December 2016. Upstream, in our US-based wood pellet manufacturing
business, both pellet plant facilities and the port facility ran commercial operations for the first full year.

**Accounting policy**
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and rebates),
any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.

We construct many of our assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated
until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives (UEL) of the
assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station – currently expected to
be 2039). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the average remaining useful life at the balance sheet
date of the main categories of asset we own in years:
Average UEL Range of
remaining UELs

Freehold buildings 23 8–32

Plant and equipment

Electricity generation plant 19 3–32

Biomass specific assets 21 4–26

Coal specific assets 23 3–32

Pellet production plant 19 5–20

Other plant, machinery and equipment 15 2–30

Decommissioning asset 23 35

Plant spare parts 23 Up to 35

Freehold land, held at cost, is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.

Electricity generation plant refers to core electricity generation assets at Drax Power Station which are fuel agnostic. Biomass-specific and
coal-specific assets are those assets that are only necessary to support electricity generation from the specified fuel and include fuel storage
and distribution systems.

Within the plant and equipment categories shorter lives are attributed to components that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling outage
cycles. The majority of assets within these categories have a remaining useful life in excess of 15 years.

Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.

Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a
separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the
item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and technological
obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date. Any changes are
applied prospectively.

**137**


-----

SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL CONTINUED

**3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued**
**Critical judgement areas**
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event (that is, an event which
may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book
value. The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output
and costs, and is therefore subjective. Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available
evidence; however an inherent degree of judgement remains.

Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. As part of the most recent annual review of asset lives, the estimated useful life of
coal-specific assets at Drax Power Station will be revised with effect from 1 January 2017. On 9 November 2016 the Government announced a
consultation on the future closure of unabated coal-fired generation. Having considered this event, management concluded that coal generation
will cease during 2025, but that the three coal units will be retained for conversion to biomass-fuelled generation in the period to 2039. This
results in the shortening to 2025 of the useful lives of the coal-specific assets which will not be required to support generation after this date.
This change is applied prospectively, from the point of management’s decision, and will result in an increase of approximately £27 million per
annum in depreciation charges from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2025.

The useful lives of electricity generation plant currently fuelled by coal are unaffected by this change. These assets can be utilised using
alternative fuel sources without material modification.

At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these assets
may be impaired. Accounting policies in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review conducted during 2016, are set out
in note 2.4.

Assets in the course of construction amounted to £120.5 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: £217.0 million). Additions to assets in the course of
construction were £88.6 million in 2016.

**138**


-----

**3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued**
Plant and equipment includes assets held under finance lease agreements with a carrying value at 31 December 2016 of £1.6 million (2015: £1.6 million).

Additions during the year include £nil (2015: £1.9 million) of capitalised borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of specific assets.

**3.2 ROC and LEC assets**
We earn ROC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”), as a result of burning sustainable compressed
wood pellets to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of these assets that we have earned but not yet sold.

As we generate more of our electricity by burning sustainable compressed wood pellets, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC assets
we have generated has increased. With the approval of the CfD in December 2016, total ROC generation is expected to reduce in 2017. Haven
Power provides us with a credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs, as do the ROC monetisation facilities described in note 7.1.

Following the Government’s decision to remove the Climate Change Levy exemption for power generated from renewable sources, as of
1 August 2015 we no longer earn LECs for electricity generated from sustainable compressed wood pellets.

**Accounting policy**
ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated sales prices.
The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in that period.

Where our retail activities incur an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred.

At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC assets generated but not sold against updated anticipated sales prices including,
where relevant, agreed forward sale contracts and taking into account likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our own ROC obligations.
Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.

**Critical judgement areas**
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated with reference to assumptions regarding future sales prices in
the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions used in the
valuation are reasonable; however actual sales prices may differ from those assumed.

ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the compliance
period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where Supplier buy-out charges (incurred by Suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy
their obligations) are returned to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels of renewable
generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in
addition to its own forecasts in calculating these estimates. Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable but they remain
subject to possible variation.

SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL CONTINUED

**3.3 Inventories**
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity, and raw materials used in the production
of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the end of the year,
including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.

**Accounting policy**
Our raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.

The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including the
purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism) and transport/
handling costs.

**Critical judgement areas**
Whilst value is largely based on observable costs, given the storage and handling characteristics of coal and biomass, an element of judgement is
inherent in calculating the volume of fuel stocks owned by the Group at any given time.

Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving around or exiting sites using technology regularly calibrated to industry
standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency calculations to
provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error.

Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist, and a provision is made where the survey
indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, the survey depends on
estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.

The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass is stored in sealed domes with a carefully controlled
atmosphere for fire prevention purposes. Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology.
However, this survey remains subject to a tolerable error range.

Experience indicates that the estimates and assumptions made by management in calculating stock volumes are reasonable. However, actual
values may differ from initial calculations.

(2015: £2.0 million) and £2.0 million of work in progress (2015: £1.8 million) in our biomass supply business.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2016 was £1,173.5 million (2015: £1,306.9 million).

**3.4 Trade and other receivables**
Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for. Other
receivables include accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be
invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group for which we are yet to receive the relevant goods or
services in return (e.g. insurance premiums relating to periods after the balance sheet date).

**Accounting policy**
Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.

Accrued income 100.0 157.0

Prepayments and other receivables 105.9 62.8

292.9 319.3

Trade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to counterparties within both our generation and retail businesses. At 31 December
2016, the Group had amounts receivable from four (2015: two) significant counterparties within the generation business, representing 46%
(2015: 41%) of trade receivables, both of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms.

Of total trade receivables at 31 December 2016, £33.4 million (2015: £41 million) relates to retail power sales. The risk profile of retail debt is
different from that of the generation business with a larger volume of counterparties, and hence a lower concentration of credit risk, with
different payment terms. All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk policies for indicators of impairment and provisions
made where appropriate. The value of retail debts that are past-due and not provided against, in accordance with this assessment, is not material.

Accordingly, management does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the normal provision for doubtful
debts of £4.0 million (2015: £4.9 million). This provision, which largely relates to retail receivables, has been determined with reference to past
default experiences in line with our policies. Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.

The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

**3.5 Trade and other payables**
Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers (for goods and services provided), tax authorities and other creditors that
are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in the future as a result of our
activities in the current year (e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced).

The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission Trading Scheme
(ETS). Accruals at 31 December 2016 include £2.8 million (2015: £10.0 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability to deliver CO2
emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.

SECTION 4:
## FINANCING AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

This section gives further information regarding the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from operations
during the year.

**4.1 Reconciliation of net debt**
Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table below reconciles net
debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.
Years ended 31 December

Our financing structure includes £325 million of term loans, comprised of a private placement of £100 million with various funds managed by
M&G Investments, a £75 million amortising loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure
UK Guarantee Scheme, a £50 million amortising term loan with Green Investment Bank and a £100 million amortising term loan facility with M&G
UK Companies Financing Fund. The loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025. All of the term loans were fully drawn down
at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.

In addition, the Group has access to a £400 million revolving credit facility (RCF). The facility matures in December 2019 and has a margin of 175
basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 2016 this facility had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of £57.9 million
(2015: £37.9 million) (see note 7.5).

The Group also has a commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades without the requirement to
post collateral.

**Accounting policy**
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the principal value
of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in
the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of
the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

**Analysis of borrowings**
Borrowings at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 consisted principally of amounts drawn down against bank loans.

**4.5 Equity and reserves**
Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares in issue, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.

**Accounting policy**
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting its liabilities.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

SECTION 5:
## OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections,
including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.

**5.1 Acquisitions**
**Accounting policy**
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The
consideration transferred and the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities
acquired are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the profits of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income
statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

**Acquisitions in the financial year**
The transactions in this section occurred in the year ended 31 December 2016 and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

**Acquisition of four OCGT development projects**
On 6 December 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Progress Power Limited (PPL), Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL),
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) and Abergelli Power Limited (APL). PPL, HPL, MPL and APL each hold a proposed development option, on land
located in England and Wales, for a 299MW Open-Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) project. Both PPL and HPL have obtained Development Consent
Orders for their sites. The acquisitions represent diversification of our generation capability in response to the changing energy requirements
of the UK.

Initial consideration of £18.6 million was settled in cash on 3 January 2017, with the amount held as a liability in the balance sheet at 31 December
2016. The final purchase price depends upon future clearing prices in T-4 capacity market auctions from 2016–2020. The range of possible
outcomes being zero further consideration if the capacity market clearing price does not exceed £28/KW in these auctions, with a maximum
contingent consideration payable of £72 million, based on a clearing price of £75/KW. The fair value of the contingent consideration at 31 December
2016 was assessed at £3.8 million based on a projection of likely future capacity market clearing prices, discounted to present value at a risk free
rate of 2%.

The provisional amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of the four companies,
and measured at fair value, are set out in the table below:
PPL HPL MPL APL Total

Financial assets 2.9 3.0 – – 5.9

Comprised of:

Initial consideration payable on 3 January 2017 in cash 7.4 7.4 1.9 1.9 18.6

Fair value of contingent consideration 1.9 1.9 – – 3.8

The intangible development assets identified as part of the acquisitions represent the value of planning and consent obtained for each site.
No cash or cash equivalents were acquired in the transaction, therefore the net cash outflow on acquisition was £18.6 million.

The four acquired companies did not trade in the period between the acquisition date and the balance sheet, and no further costs were incurred.
Accordingly, the Consolidated income statement includes no revenue or EBITDA in respect of the acquired companies. Transaction costs of
£0.7 million were recognised as an expense in the period.

**Acquisitions after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements were approved**
The following disclosures relate to acquisitions completed between 1 January and 15 February 2017.

**146**


-----

**5.1 Acquisitions continued**
**Acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited**
On 6 December 2016, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited (Opus Energy) for a consideration of
£340 million, plus interest calculated on the amount of Opus Energy’s net assets from 31 March 2016 to the acquisition completion date.

Opus Energy is a well-established energy retail business serving business customers in the SME market. The transaction represents a
diversification of the Group’s retail offering, strengthening our presence in the SME market, and provides a range of strategic and financial
benefits. Opus Energy is expected to contribute positively to earnings and cash flow immediately following the acquisition and the combination
provides a robust platform for future growth.

The transaction was approved by shareholders on 8 February 2017 and subsequently completed on 10 February 2017, the Group acquired 100%
of the issued share capital on this date.

Total consideration paid in cash, including interest as described above, amounted to £367 million. No deferred or contingent consideration is
payable. The acquisition was funded by a combination of existing cash reserves and a new £375 million loan facility which was partially drawn on
10 February 2017. Further details regarding the new facility are disclosed in note 4.3.

Given the short period of time between the transaction completion date and the approval of these financial statements, the initial accounting
for the business combination is not complete. The table below provides the approximate acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in the transaction based as the most recently available management information. These figures, including the indicative
goodwill, are provisional.
Total
£m

Financial assets 169.9

Property, plant and equipment 5.6

Financial liabilities (130.3)

Total identifiable net assets 45.2

Goodwill 322.1

Fair value of consideration payable 367.3

The provisional goodwill reflects the economic and strategic benefits described above. A full review and finalisation of identifiable intangible
assets acquired will be completed before the initial accounting for the transaction is completed. Accordingly, the amount of goodwill recognised
in the financial statements may be lower than indicated above.

The provisional financial assets acquired include £170 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for energy supplied
to customers measured at cost. By virtue of their short tenor, the contractual amounts receivable and the fair value of these receivables are
considered to be the same. A provision for doubtful debts of £3 million is included within the values above and reflects the best estimate of the
contractual cash flows not expected to be recovered.

As the transaction completed after the balance sheet date, there are no amounts included in these financial statements in respect of the
transaction other than transaction costs of £1.6 million incurred before 31 December 2016, which have been recognised as an expense in
Operating and administrative costs in the income statement.

SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED

**5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets**
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. Our goodwill relates to
the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 and Billington Bioenergy in 2015. Other intangibles include development assets recognised on the
acquisition of four OCGT development projects in 2016 and amounts paid in respect of carbon emission allowances for future years.

**Accounting policy**
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU assessed.
Intangibles are recognised at fair value or cost.


The table shows movements and balances:

Cost and carrying amount:


Goodwill

At 1 January 2015 10.7 – – 10.7

Additions at cost – 21.0 0.7 21.7

At 31 December 2016 14.5 21.0 0.7 36.2

**Goodwill**
Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 was £14.5 million, with £10.7 million arising on the
acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU and £3.8 million arising on the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy in 2015
attributable to the Billington Bioenergy CGU.

The recoverable amount of both the Haven Power and Billington Bioenergy CGUs is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation. The
approach for this calculation is the same as that used for the wider asset impairment review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2016 and
is disclosed in note 2.4. At 31 December 2016, the value in use of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value in both the Haven Power
and Billington Bioenergy CGUs.

**Development assets**
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four OCGT projects in December 2016 (see note 5.1) and reflect the value of planning and
consents acquired as part of that transaction. They were measured at fair value on acquisition and will be amortised over the expected period of
useful economic life of the projects once they reach commercial operations. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an
indefinite life and thus will be subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.

At 31 December 2016, given the short time since the acquisition of the assets, management consider the fair value of the development assets to
be equivalent to the purchase price.

**Carbon assets**
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the ETS and required for the current
financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment.

The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the current
year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further purchases are
required, the market price at the balance sheet date.

**148**


-----

**5.3 Provisions**
We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and remediating
the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. The amount represents the discounted present value of the expected costs.

**Accounting policy**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group
will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating assets,
when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction
in the provision is made for any such proceeds. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate of 1.9% (2015: 2.4%), reflecting the fact that the
estimated future cash flows have built in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within
property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest
payable and similar charges.

Unwinding of discount 0.7

At 1 January 2016 30.5

Unwinding of discount 0.8

Adjustment for change in discount rate 3.7

At 31 December 2016 35.0

The provision is estimated using the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the expected useful
life of the power station in 2039, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice,
updated on a triennial basis. The most recent update took place in December 2014.

SECTION 6:
## OUR PEOPLE

The notes in this section relate to the remuneration of our directors and employees, including our obligations under retirement benefit schemes.

**6.1 Employees and directors**
This note provides a more detailed breakdown of the cost of our employees, including executive directors. The average number of employees in
Operations (staff based at production sites), Retail services (employees in our Retail segment) and Central services (those working in central
functions) are also provided.

**6.2 Share-based payments**
We operate two share option schemes for our employees – the BMP for directors and senior executives, and the Savings-Related Share Option
Plan (SAYE) for all qualifying employees. We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below
along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.

**Accounting policy**
All of the Group’s share-based payments are equity-settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity
instrument at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will
ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year were as follows:

**Share Incentive Plan (SIP)**
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year. Matching shares
were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group.
There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.

Shares in the Company held under trust and under the Company’s control as a result of the SIP were as follows:

**Bonus Matching Plan**
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior
executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus. A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion
of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2016, 2015 and
2014 BMP awards, of £2.6 million, £3.3 million and £5.4 million respectively, is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the corresponding three year vesting periods.

The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different
levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2016 awards are the share price at the grant date (249.7 pence), expected volatility
(41%), and risk free interest rate (0.45%). The fair value of each option granted was 153 pence.

At 31 December 3,193,932 3,411,792

50% of the BMP options granted in 2016 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies with the
remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard (2015: 50% TSR-linked, 50% scorecard-linked). The share price
on the grant date for BMP options awarded in the year was 250 pence (2015: 397 pence) and the weighted average fair value of the BMP options
granted during the year was 153 pence (2015: 213 pence).

For the BMP options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 232 pence (2015: 397 pence).

All of the BMP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of £nil (2015: £nil). The weighted average remaining contractual
life was 17 months (2015: 14 months).

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2015: nil).

SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE CONTINUED

**6.2 Share-based payments continued**
**Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE)**
In April 2016, participation in the SAYE Plan was offered again to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to acquire shares
at a price of 203 pence (2015: 319 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the
scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five year savings contracts. The fair value of the options granted in connection
with the SAYE Plan of £3.9 million (2015: £4.4 million) is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant contracts.

At 31 December 3,286,906 996,709 1,948,209 934,041

The fair value of SAYE awards is calculated using a Black-Scholes model, which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.

The fair value of SAYE options granted and the inputs to the option pricing model used in the current and previous year are set out in the table
below:

5 April 5 April 2 April 2 April

Grant date 2016 2016 2015 2015

Share price at grant date (pence) 286 286 399 399

Expected volatility 40.0% 37.6% 43.0% 43.0%

Fair value of options granted (pence) 101 82 142 160

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and five years
respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability,
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 337 pence (2015: 400 pence).

The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 216 pence (2015: 331 pence). The weighted
average remaining contractual life was 31 months (2015: 32 months).

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2015: 10,894).

Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report.

**6.3 Retirement benefit obligations**
We operate a defined benefit and three defined contribution pension schemes.

The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) is a defined benefit scheme; a pension arrangement under
which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically entitled to an
annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.

The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan are defined contribution schemes,
which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the relevant scheme.

**152**


-----

**6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued**
**Accounting policy**
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the
contributions.

For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the
effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the balance sheet with
a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service
costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating
and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs.

The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect of the
current period.

**Significant judgement areas**
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including discount
rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as
appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior
experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.

The assumptions applied in 2016 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with independent
actuarial advice received.

**Defined contribution schemes**
The Group operates three defined contribution schemes, The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax
Biomass inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows:

Years ended 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Total included in staff costs (note 6.1) 5.6 5.9

As at 31 December 2016, contributions of £0.5 million (2015: £0.4 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to
the schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

**Defined benefit scheme**
The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another
part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.

The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:

Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform
this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities, property and direct
lending) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long term objectives.

Discount rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this will be partially
offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will
result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.

Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such higher inflation will lead to higher
liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, such
that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place, to protect
against extreme inflation.

SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE CONTINUED

**6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued**
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing the burden
on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants
eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.

A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension. See note 7.5 for details.

The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016 is not
yet complete; however the actuarial review at 31 December 2016 is based on the same membership and other data as the initial results of this
funding valuation. The scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of
assessing the scheme cost. Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.

The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience over
the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. The present value of
the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal
assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows:
As at 31 December

2016 2015
% p.a. % p.a.

Discount rate 2.8 3.9

Inflation (RPI) 3.2 3.1

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.1 3.0

Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.8 3.7

Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements in
mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2016 will live, on average, for a further 27 years if they are male (2015: 27 years)
and for a further 29 years if they are female (2015: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners currently aged 45
is assumed to be 28 and 31 years respectively (2015: 28 and 31 years respectively).

The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan
assets, determined as follows:
As at 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Defined benefit obligation 311.4 244.6

Fair value of plan assets (281.3) (215.1)

Benefits paid (7.6) (7.2)

Defined benefit obligation at 31 December 311.4 244.6

The actuarial losses of £58.8 million (2015: £5.8 million gains) reflect losses of £71.4 million arising from changes in financial assumptions
(2015: gains of £2.3 million), offset by £1.9 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions and gains arising from scheme
experience of £10.7 million (2015: gains of £1.8 million and £1.7 million respectively).

The losses due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the increase in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a result
of the change in discount rate assumption to 2.75% (2015: 3.9%) following reductions in corporate bond yields.

Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows:

Employer contributions included payments totalling £8.3 million (2015: £5.1 million) to reduce the actuarial deficit.

The actual return on plan assets in the period was £58.9 million (2015: £3.2 million).

The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows:
As at 31 December

Fair value of total plan assets 281.3 215.1

Notes:
(1) At 31 December 2016 the scheme’s long-term asset strategy was: global equity (20%), direct lending (10%), emerging market equity (5%), fixed interest bonds (15%), corporate bonds (6%), liability
driven investing (29%) and long lease property (15%).
(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds. Approximately 27% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower).
(3) Other assets include £19.1 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2015: £7.9 million).

**155**

SECTION 6: OUR PEOPLE CONTINUED

**6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued**
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets are studied
and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. The overall
expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to the actual asset allocation
for the scheme.

The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially
significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension deficit
at 31 December 2016 to changes in these assumptions:

(Decrease)/
Increase in
net liability

% £m

Discount rate – Increase 0.25 (15.6)

– Decrease 0.25 16.2

Inflation rate[(1)] – Increase 0.25 (14.0)

– Decrease 0.25 13.6

Life expectancy – Increase 1 year (10.9)

– Decrease 1 year 11.0

Note:
(1) The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation.

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions where it is
estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.

As at 31 December

2016 2015 2014 2013 2012
£m £m £m £m £m

Defined benefit obligation (311.4) (244.6) (242.1) (220.9) (199.0)

Fair value of plan assets 281.3 215.1 207.8 179.2 156.9

Deficit (30.1) (29.5) (34.3) (41.7) (42.1)

Experience adjustments on plan liabilities 10.7 1.7 1.6 8.7 (1.7)

Experience adjustments on plan assets 50.4 (4.6) 13.6 9.4 (3.0)

The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the Group who are yet to retire
(5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected to be made, or the duration of the
scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.

The Group expects to contribute £23.8 million to the defined benefit pension plan during the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 and make
regular deficit contributions over the period to 2025.

The Group intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the 31 March 2013 funding valuation, over the period to 31 December 2019.

SECTION 7:
## RISK MANAGEMENT

This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.

**7.1 Financial risk management**
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk,
counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial
markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the risk management
committees as explained in Principal risks and uncertainties (page 55) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination
with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.

**Commodity price risk**
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable wood
fibre and pellets and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the
financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.

The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so.
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow
exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.

The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from a
variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and financial coal
contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow
exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.

The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and
international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges
as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.

**Commodity price sensitivity**
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance
sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.

If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

– profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2016 would increase/decrease by £3.4 million (2015: decrease/increase by £6.7 million).
This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and
– the hedge reserve would increase/decrease by £36.3 million (2015: decrease/increase by £11.5 million) mainly as a result of the changes in the
fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.

**Interest rate risk**
Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate this risk with
interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date; however
this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and
their repayment schedules is provided below.

**Interest rate sensitivity**
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet
date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was
outstanding for the whole year.

If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for the year ended
31 December 2016 would decrease/increase by £1.8 million (2015: decrease/increase by £1.8 million) as a result of the changes in interest payable
during the period.

**157**


-----

SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

**7.1 Financial risk management continued**
**Foreign currency risk**
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into in order to hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars,
wood pellet purchases in US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in Euros.

Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts. The Group
enters into forward currency purchase contracts to hedge its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period for both
contracted and forecast transactions.

**Foreign currency sensitivity**
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

– profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2016 would decrease/increase by £252.6 million/£277.7 million (2015: decrease/increase by
£233.0 million/£241.1 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation to
fuel purchase contracts; and
– other equity reserves would increase/decrease by £78.7 million/£87 million (2015: increase/decrease by £67.8 million/£75.0 million) as a result
of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.

**Liquidity risk**
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors. Liquidity
needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group maintains a mixture of cash and
cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.

The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both interest
and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the
balance sheet date.

1,252.2 921.0 1,786.2 3,959.4

In managing liquidity risk, the Group has access to facilities that enable it to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain of its receivables
(principally those related to ROC sales and retail power sales). Each of these facilities is provided on a non-recourse basis and accordingly
receivables sold under each facility are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. At the balance sheet date there was
£111.1 million utilised under ROC agreements and £74.4 million utilised under Receivable financing agreements.

**Counterparty risk**
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of currency, coal, sustainable compressed wood pellets and other goods and services,
it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall into financial difficulty and/or fail to deliver
against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from other suppliers.

The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these counterparties to
perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.

**Credit risk**
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below:

As at 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Financial assets:

Cash and cash equivalents 228.4 133.8

Trade and other receivables 296.9 324.2

Derivative financial instruments 891.3 609.2

1,416.6 1,067.2

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £4.0 million (2015: £4.9 million).

Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees. Where considered
appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge,
or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.

The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure
by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.

**159**

SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

**7.1 Financial risk management continued**
**Capital management**
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return to
shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity
(excluding the hedge reserve), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in note 4.2.

As at 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Borrowings 321.9 320.4

Cash and cash equivalents (228.4) (133.8)

Net debt 93.5 186.6

Total shareholders’ equity, excluding hedge reserve 1,739.8 1,567.5

**Dividend policy**
It is the Group’s policy to distribute 50% of underlying profit after tax to shareholders each year. The policy is designed to ensure dividends
reflect the underlying trading performance of the business whilst retaining sufficient cash within the Group to support strategic development
objectives and working capital requirements. Underlying earnings are based on earnings calculated in accordance with IFRS adjusted to exclude
the post-tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and any other one-off or otherwise exceptional items that the Board
considers to be unrepresentative of the Group’s trading and operational performance.

**7.2 Derivative financial instruments**
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and CO2
emissions allowances) to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial contracts (principally
currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix Sterling cash flows.

We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price risk and foreign
currency risk (see note 7.1).

A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model. Our policy is to fix exposures to commodity price movements and
changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to de-risk the business, providing
security and certainty over cash flows into the future. As at 31 December 2016, due to the weakening of Sterling against the US dollar, our forward
derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies (principally for the purpose of fixing the
Sterling cost of sustainable compressed wood pellet purchases), increased to £545.1 million (2015: £143 million) thereby protecting the Group to
that extent from the increased cost of future supplies denominated in foreign currencies from the weakness of Sterling.

**Accounting policy**
At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the
difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.

Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question
qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4).

Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value
mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or usage
requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.

Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances and
forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39 and are recorded in the balance sheet
at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective
hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. The Group enters into
forward contracts solely for the purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges, regardless of
whether the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met.

Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or liabilities.
Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.

Total net gains in hedge reserve 330.1

Total net gains in income statement 176.8

**Critical judgement areas**
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of
a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable
market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded
portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market
commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements.
The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.

**Fair value accounting**
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, financial coal,
financial oil, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value
as follows:
As at 31 December 2016 As at 31 December 2015

SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

**7.2 Derivative financial instruments continued**
The total movement in the fair value of these contracts of £506.9 million (2015: £147.1 million gain) is recognised in the income statement or the
hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows:
Years ended 31 December

2016 2015
£m £m

Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 176.8 123.7

Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in the hedge reserve (note 7.4) 330.1 23.4

Total unrealised gains on derivative contracts 506.9 147.1

We maintain a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in foreign currencies.
The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are denominated in US dollars. Compared to market
exchange rates immediately prior to the EU referendum in June 2016, Sterling depreciated by approximately 15–20% against the US dollar by the
balance sheet date. As a result, combined with the high volume of such contracts held (shown in the table on page 161), the net unrealised gains
recognised in the year principally reflect the value of our forward currency purchase contract portfolio.

A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IAS 39 and thus the gains on these
contracts were recognised in the income statement.

Unrealised gains recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains on the portion of our forward currency exchange contracts that are
designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39.

**Fair value measurement**

– Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own use exemption is calculated by
reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available
for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price
for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
– Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using
forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
– Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own use exemption, is calculated by
reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available
for the duration of the contracts.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.

The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain embedded
derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require
separate valuation from their host contracts.

We are required by IFRS to categorise our financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on which
their fair values have been determined:

Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the
fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.

The fair value of commodity contracts, forward foreign currency exchange contracts and the contingent consideration in the OCGT acquisition
(see note 5.1) are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are
categorised as Level 2.

There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.

**162**


-----

**7.3 Other financial instruments**
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables arising
from our operations.

**Accounting policy**
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 3.4), and trade and other payables (note 3.5) generally have short times to
maturity. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s borrowings (note 4.3) relate
principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating
rate instruments.

**7.4 Hedge reserve**
Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to the extent that
they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts
mature and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.

As described in note 7.2, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging; however, not all of these contracts
qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS effective hedge are
recognised in the income statement. Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving prices and
securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.

The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges. At the
inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management
objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into
such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency exchange
contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked to market at each period end for the effective
portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related
contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered.
For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised. Further information about the Group’s accounting
for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.

SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

**7.5 Contingent liabilities**
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control. The amount and
timing of any payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely.

**Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)**
The UK Government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would
correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group (note 6.3). At present, the methodology for implementing the
equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in
the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated financial statements.

**Borrowings**
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks
in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2016 the Group’s contingent liability in
respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £57.9 million (2015: £37.9 million).

**7.6 Commitments**
We have a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not recorded in our
balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and biomass,
operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power Station over the period from 2017–2027. To the extent these contracts
relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in our financial statements owing to application of the “own-use”
exemption from fair value accounting to such contracts (see note 7.2).

SECTION 8:
## REFERENCE INFORMATION

This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general information about the Group (e.g. operations and
registered office). We also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note.

**8.1 General information**
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries (together,
the Group) have three principal activities:

– Electricity generation;

– Electricity supply to business customers; and

– Manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.

The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US. The Group also
operates in the UK domestic heat market.

The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United
Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which follow these
consolidated financial statements.

**8.2 Basis of preparation**
**Adoption of new and revised accounting standards**
A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2016. The Group adopted the following from 1 January 2016:

IAS 27 (amended) – Separate Financial Statements – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

Annual improvements to 2012–2014 Cycle – all amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 16 (amended) – Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 (amended) Intangible Assets – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 19 (amended) – Defined Benefit Plans: Employee contributions – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 February 2015.

IFRS 11 (amended) – Joint Arrangements – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

The adoption of these updates and amendments has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which have
not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU –
marked by *):

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IFRS 15 (including clarifications issued on 12 Aril 2016) – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.*

IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) – effective
date deferred indefinitely.*

IAS 12 (amended) – Income Taxes – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.*

IAS 7 (amended) – Statement of Cash Flows – effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.*

IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.*

IAS 40 (amended) – Investment Property – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

**165**


-----

SECTION 8: REFERENCE INFORMATION CONTINUED

Following endorsement by the EU, the Group expects to adopt IFRS 9 in line with the 1 January 2018 effective date. The adoption of this standard
is not expected to have a material impact on the recognition or measurement of the Group’s financial instruments. However, following adoption it
is anticipated that more of the Group’s forward purchase contracts will in future qualify for hedge accounting under the new standard than
under the existing standard. This will likely result in a greater proportion of unrealised gains and losses being recognised in the hedge reserve
and an associated reduction in income statement volatility.

The Group is in the process of completing a preliminary impact assessment for the adoption of IFRS 15, which is expected to be adopted in line
with the effective date of 1 January 2018. Whilst further work is required, the Group expects to review and update its revenue recognition policies
in light of the updated requirements. Based on the initial findings of this process, a material change to the quantum and timing of profitability is
considered unlikely at this stage.

The Group has not yet concluded its initial impact assessment into the adoption of IFRS 16; however at this stage the standard is not expected
to have a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of amounts within the financial statements in respect of leases.
The Group currently expects to adopt IFRS 16 in the period it becomes mandatory, subject to EU endorsement.

Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

**8.3 Accounting policies**
The accounting policies set out below are considered to be general to the financial statements and not covered by a specific note.

**Foreign currency transactions**
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items are not retranslated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within finance costs.

**Foreign operations**
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated into sterling using published exchange
rates at the reporting date. The income and expenditure of such operations are translated into sterling using the exchange rate prevailing at the
date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of the operation’s net assets and its results for the
year are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**8.4 Related party transactions**
A related party is either an individual or entity with control or significant influence over the Group, or a company that is linked to us by investment
(such as an associated company or joint venture). Our primary related parties are our key management personnel.

**Remuneration of key management personnel**
The remuneration of the directors and Executive Committee members, who are considered to be the key management personnel of the Group, is
set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”. Further information about the remuneration
of individual directors, together with the directors’ interests in the share capital of Drax Group plc, is provided in the audited part of the
Remuneration Committee report.

Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks
that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’
statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern
basis of accounting contained on page 104 to the financial
statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term
viability of the group contained within the strategic report on
pages 50 and 51.


We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern
basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee
as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting
Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that
we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We
also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit
services referred to in those standards.


Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of
the engagement team.


We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

– the directors’ confirmation on page 53 that they have carried
out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group,
including those that would threaten its business model, future
performance, solvency or liquidity;
– the disclosures on pages 54, 55 that describe those risks and
explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
– the directors’ statement on page 104 to the financial
statements about whether they considered it appropriate to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the
Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial
statements;
– the director’s explanation 50, 51 as to how they have assessed
the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so
and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment,
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any
necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk


Asset impairment
On 1 August 2015, the UK government announced the withdrawal
of support under the CCL resulting in a significant loss of income
and a reduction in market value, below the net asset value.
Earnings have also been impacted by low market prices resulting
in reductions in underlying profits. Management has therefore
performed an impairment review in the current year.

As noted in the Group’s critical accounting judgements,
estimates and assumptions in note 2.3 and the Audit Committee
report on page 72, asset impairment has been considered a
key risk.

The impairment testing is subject to the application of
management judgement in identifying Cash Generating Units
(CGUs) and various assumptions underlying the calculation of
value in use for each CGU identified. These assumptions include
the achievability of the long term business plan and related
modelling assumptions underlying the valuation process.

Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts
Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in the
income statement are £123.7 million (2014: £65.8 million), with
derivative financial statement assets of £330.8 million (2014:
£139.1 million) and derivative financial statement liabilities of
£274.3 million (2014 £130.7 million) on the balance sheet.

The valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is
complex and requires judgement in areas such as estimates of
future prices, market movements, and assumptions of credit risk.

The accounting standards governing the availability and
application of hedge accounting are complex, and require
judgement in their applications.

Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s
critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in
section 7 and the Audit Committee report on page 72.


We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key
controls related to asset impairment.

The significant judgements have been disclosed by management
in note 2.3 and include:

– The award of a CfD for the third biomass unit with an
assumed price of £100/MWh;
– Some form of support in place after the current ROC regime
ends in 2027 with a value to incentivise profitable generation;
– Forecast biomass prices in the long term, given that biomass
is not a standardised commodity traded openly on exchanges.

We utilised our valuation specialists to benchmark key market
related assumptions including commodity prices, current and
future government support mechanisms and discount rates
against external data where available. For example, we have
compared the estimated strike price of £100/MWh assumed by
management to the EC approved strike price of £105/MWh for
the conversion of Lynemouth power station in December 2015.

We have considered the expected government support that
biomass could receive after the end of the current ROC regime
in 2027 relative to other renewable technologies to determine
whether management’s assumptions are reasonable.

We have considered the liquidity of the biomass market and
the impact that Drax could have on that market relating to the
volumes of biomass required in the future.

We have also challenged the underlying assumptions and
significant judgements used in management’s impairment
model by:

– Running a range of sensitivities to assess whether an
impairment would be required if a range of more conservative
assumptions were adopted.
– Assessing the historical accuracy of management’s budgets
and forecasts by comparing them to actual performance and
verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models.
– Assessing whether the disclosures in note 2.3 of the financial
statements appropriately disclose the key judgements taken
so that the reader of the accounts is aware of the impact of
the financial statement of changes to key assumptions that
may lead to impairment.

We carried out testing of the design and implementation of
key controls related to the valuation of commodity and foreign
exchange contracts.

We used our financial instruments specialists to test
management’s key judgements and calculations, including
testing a sample of trades undertaken to supporting trade tickets
confirming key information such as volumes and market price.

We challenged the assumptions involved in determining
valuation, hedge effectiveness and credit risk, including analysis
of the forward price curves used and hedge effectiveness
documentation maintained.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk


Valuation of biomass and coal stocks
Biomass stocks of £119 million and coal stocks of £89 million
(2014: £81 million and £145 million respectively) are held on
the balance sheet at year end. The valuation of biomass and
coal stocks is dependent upon the estimation or measurement
respectively of the tonnage held, the calorific value, its purchase
price and its net realisable value. The weighted average cost
calculation is complex for both coal and biomass and this results
in increasing risk of management error or bias and therefore an
increased risk of material misstatement. Further details of the
key accounting policy judgements are included in note 3.3.

Valuation and recoverability of ROCs
£266 million of ROCs are held on the balance sheet at the year
end (2014: £174 million). ROCs are recognised as they are earned
through generating electricity from burning biomass. They are
initially recognised at fair value (reducing the cost of biomass
in the income statement) and subsequently written down to
the net realisable value as appropriate. Judgement is required
from management in estimating both the initial fair value
and estimated net realisable value, including the value of any
recycling fund element. Further detail is explained in the Group’s
critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in
note 3.2 and the Audit Committee report on page 72.


We have assessed the initial fair value of ROCs by agreement of
the buy-out price to available third party supporting information
and external sales agreements.

We have also challenged the estimation by management
of the recycling fund element which impacts the estimated
net realisable value of the ROCs held in the balance sheet at
year end. This included comparison to other available third
party estimates.


We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key
controls related to the valuation of biomass and coal stocks.

Our audit procedures include testing the underlying weighted
average cost calculation for both coal and biomass to source
data such as purchase invoice for amounts delivered in the year.
Our procedures also included sample testing of the calorific value
to third party laboratory reports or purchase invoice.


We evaluated the results of external surveys completed on the
coal pile at the year end and attended the survey to assess the
controls over the accuracy of the survey. We assessed biomass
deliveries and usage associated with the calculation of biomass
volumes held at the year end.

On a sample basis we also requested and received external stock
confirmation for stocks held off site and agreed these to the
underlying records.


We carried out testing of the design and implementation of key
controls related to the valuation and recoverability of ROCs.

We gained assurance over the ROCs generated in the year by
agreement to Ofgem confirmation certificates and available
burn data.

##### Independent auditor’s report to the members of Drax Group plc
###### continued


Last year our report included one risk which is not included this year
relating to the useful economic life and carrying value of property,
plant and equipment. This risk has been considered as part of our
asset impairment work by considering the consistency of asset
impairment assumptions with estimated useful economic lives.

The description of risks above should be read in conjunction
with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee
discussed on page 72.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement
in the financial statements that makes it probable that the
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person
would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the
results of our work.

When determining materiality, we considered the decline
in earnings this year and at present do not consider that this
decline is likely to reflect a long-term reduction in the size
and scale of the business.

We therefore determined materiality by considering a range of
possible benchmarks and the figures derived from those, then
selecting a materiality within that range that we considered
appropriate. We determined materiality for the Group on a
blended basis to be £6.1 million (2014: £6.1 million).

This materiality equates to 0.4% of net assets and 13.3% of
underlying profit before tax, before unrealised gains or losses
on derivative contracts and one-off asset obsolescence charges.
Last year we used a benchmark of 5% of underlying profit before
tax, before unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts and
the one-off CESP settlement.

In determining materiality at £6.1 million, we concluded that as
the scale of the business has not changed, we would apply
an appropriately conservative approach and ensure that
materiality did not exceed the materiality set in the prior year.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.1 million (2014:
£0.1 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to
the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and
in evaluating the results of our work.


An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the
group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level.
Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope
primarily on the audit work at three locations (2014: the same
three locations), being Drax Power, Haven Power and Drax
Biomass. All of these were subject to a full audit. These three
locations represent the principal business units and account for all
of the group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax. They were
also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified
above. Our audit work at the 3 locations was executed at levels of
materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower
than group materiality and ranged from £3.0 million to £4.8 million
(2014: £2.9 million to £5.5 million).

At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the
aggregated financial information of the remaining components
not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.

The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned
visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor
visits each of the locations where the group audit scope was
focused at least once every two years and the most significant
locations several times a year. During 2015, the senior statutory
auditor visited each significant location.

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:

– the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006; and
– the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,
in our opinion:

– we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit; or
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
– the parent company financial statements are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in
our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not
been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.


-----

Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.

Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the
annual report is:


– materially inconsistent with the information in the audited
financial statements; or
– apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in
the course of performing our audit; or
– otherwise misleading.

In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the
audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual
report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated
to the audit committee which we consider should have been
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such
inconsistencies or misleading statements.

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement,
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our
audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality
controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards
review team and independent partner reviews.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.


Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

##### Financial statements

Introduction
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed information
about the financial performance (Consolidated income statement),
financial position (Consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows
(Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the
Company) together with all of the entities controlled by
the Company (collectively, the Group).

The notes to the financial statements provide additional information
on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated
balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes
include explanations of the information presented. In general, the
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is
required by law, IFRS or other regulations to facilitate increased
understanding of the primary statements set out on pages 107 to 111.

Where relevant, we have set out key elements of our business model
(see pages 16 to 19) and how this has affected our financial results.

This year we have changed the way our financial statements
and the associated notes are presented. The notes are grouped
by function together, with related information, including
accounting policies, areas involving significant judgement
and related explanations.

Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the
EU IAS Regulation.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have
been measured at fair value.

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments
that may affect its financial performance, position and cash
flows, are set out within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 55
of this document.

In the viability statement on page 50 the Directors state that
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over
the next three years.

Consequently, the Directors also have a reasonable expectation
that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months
and, therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing
these financial statements.


Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the
financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by
the Company, (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each
year. The Company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries.

The impact of all intra-Group transactions is eliminated
on consolidation.

The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included
in the consolidated income statement from the date the Group
gained control.

Accounting policies
Those accounting policies that are material to our financial
statements are described in note 8.3 to the financial statements
or, where specific to an individual component of the financial
statements, in the relevant note (see contents on page 106).

We have not changed any of our accounting policies in the period.

A full listing of new standards, interpretations and
pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these financial
statements is presented in note 8.2. The application of these
new requirements has not had a material effect on the
financial statements.

Judgements, estimates and uncertainties
The preparation of financial statements requires management to
exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It
also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity
are set out below and in more detail in the related notes.

Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The judgements that carry the most significant risk of an outcome
that differs from the amount recognised in the financial
statements are as follows:

Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment
is depreciated on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future
replacement cycles and other available evidence, however,
a degree of judgement is required.

_More information: note 3.1 on page 120_


-----

Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually
for goodwill and for other assets where an indicator of possible
impairment exists. The assessment of future cash flows that
underpins such a review is based up management’s best estimate
of future prices, volumes and economic conditions. The calculations
are particularly sensitive to judgement given the long time period
covered by the assessment.

_More information: note 2.3 on page 114_

Derivatives – derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
Group’s balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value
depends upon assuming a market price for the instrument in
question. The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon
forward curves that are largely derived from readily attainable
quotations and third party sources. However, any forward curve is
based at least in part upon assumptions around future transactions
and market movements. Where such instruments extend beyond
the liquid portion of the forward curve, the level of judgement
increases as the number of observable transactions decreases.

_More information: note 7.2 on page 138_

Inventories – fuel inventories are valued at weighted average
cost based on purchase price, or net realisable value where lower.
Valuation is largely based on observable data (such as invoiced
costs and automated weigher readings). However, given the bulk
nature of fuels an element of judgement is required to assess the
volume of stock held at the balance sheet date.

_More information: note 3.3 on page 123_

ROCs – the carrying amount of ROCs in the Group’s balance sheet
are stated at their expected realisable value. This assessment is
based on an estimated future sales price.

_More information: note 3.2 on page 122_


Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s activities,
particularly within the Retail segment, result in revenue being
based on the estimated volumes of power supplied to customers
at an estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that underpin
these estimates are applied consistently and comparison of past
estimates to final settlements suggests a high degree of accuracy.
However, given the level of judgement involved, actual outcomes
may vary from initial estimates.

_More information: note 8.3 on page 144_

Non-statutory measures of financial performance
We present two non-statutory measures on the face of our income
statement. Our non-statutory measures exclude certain items,
including any transactions considered to be one-off in nature,
to provide a measure of the underlying trading and operational
performance of the Group.

EBITDA is the primary measure we use to assess our financial
performance. EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax,
depreciation (including asset obsolescence charges and gains or
losses on asset disposals), amortisation and unrealised gains on
derivative contracts. In 2014, it also excluded the one-off
settlement of CESP (see note 2.2 for further details).


Underlying measures, including underlying profit before and after
tax and underlying earnings per share (EPS) exclude the impact of
unrealised gains on derivative contracts, asset obsolescence
charges and the one-off settlement of CESP in 2014. Underlying
profit after tax and EPS exclude the post-tax effect of these items.

Under our current distribution policy, dividends are calculated
based upon 50% of underlying profit after tax. A reconciliation
from profit for the year attributable to equity holders to underlying
profit after tax is provided in note 2.6.


Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Pensions – the Group records a liability in its balance sheet for its
obligation to provide benefits under an approved defined benefit
pension scheme less the fair value of assets held by the pension
scheme. The actuarial valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities
is performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding
interest rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases,
mortality and other factors.

_More information: note 6.3 on page 131_

Taxation – in accounting for tax liabilities the Group makes
assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items of income
and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions are based
on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where required,
consultation with external advisors.

###### Section 2: Financial Performance
The financial performance section gives further detail on the information in the Consolidated income
statement. It includes a summary of financial performance by business unit (2.1), analysis of certain
income statement items (2.2–2.5) and information regarding underlying earnings, distributable profits
and dividends (2.6–2.8). Further commentary regarding our trading and operational performance during
the year, which is predominantly reflected within EBITDA, can be found within the Strategic report on
pages 1 to 55, with particular reference to key achievements and market conditions that have impacted
our results.

2.1 Segmental reporting
On 1 March 2015 the Group reorganised into three businesses with a dedicated management team for each: Generation: the generation
of electricity at Drax Power Station; Biomass Supply: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in
the US; and Retail: the supply of power to business customers and wood pellets to the domestic heat market. Each business is an
operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. Following the reorganisation, information reported to the Board for the
purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is organised into these three operating segments. The measure
of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA.

Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Unallocated costs
are included within central operating costs.

Prior period comparatives have been restated to the extent the information is available. Costs were entirely allocated to segments in
previous periods.

Notes:
(1) Adjustments represent the elimination of intra-group transactions.

Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the management
accounts. However, spend on key capital projects is monitored. Total spend on the biomass transformation project during 2015 was £90
million (2014: £125 million), of which £22 million (2014: £85 million) relates to construction of assets within the Biomass Supply segment.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. The revenue and results of all of our
reporting segments are subject to seasonality with higher despatch and prices in the winter months, compared to summer months.


Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arms-length, commercial terms that where possible equate to market prices at the time
of the transaction. During 2015, the Biomass Supply segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £28.4 million (2014: £nil) to the
Generation segment and the Generation segment sold power, ROCs and LECs with a total value of £863.2 million (2014: £735.2 million)
to the Retail segment.

The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising (£1.6 million at 31 December 2015), is eliminated
on consolidation.


Major customers
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 includes amounts of £597.7 million and £468.0 million (2014: £320.6 million and
£288.7 million) derived from two customers (2014: two customers), each representing 10% or more of the Group’s revenue for the year.
These revenues arose in the Generation segment.

2.3 Impairment review and asset obsolescence charges
Accounting policy
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units) whenever there is an
indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate
independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven Power, Drax Biomass and Billington Bioenergy) and accordingly
considers the Group to be comprised of four cash-generating units (CGUs).

If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or cash-generating unit (value in use)
or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value).

Whilst IFRS requires estimates of future cash flows to be discounted using a pre-tax rate, market rates are generally more widely available
on a post-tax basis. In utilising a post-tax discount rate, the Group takes account of its specific tax characteristics to ensure the
impairment calculations are not affected.

If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount within the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the
carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised
immediately within the income statement.

Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2). Impairment charges, as one-off items that are typically not
reflective of the underlying performance of the Group in a given period, are excluded from underlying earnings (see note 2.6).

Critical judgement areas
During 2015, weak commodity markets and the removal of LEC income for the Generation business contributed to a substantial and
sustained reduction in the Group’s share price. As a result, the market capitalisation of the Group fell materially below the carrying value of
the Group’s net assets, an indicator of possible impairment. Accordingly a full impairment review was undertaken at the balance sheet date.

The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions.
In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output, costs and
economic support for renewable energy generation.

The impairment methodology, calculations and the supporting assumptions were reviewed by the Audit Committee (see page 72).
The key assumptions were benchmarked and calculation methodology assessed by an independent expert with relevant industry
experience. The most critical of these assumptions are discussed below.


-----

2.3 Impairment review and asset obsolescence charges continued
Impairment review
The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested using a broad range of assumptions, including the expected economic life of its six
power generating units, their fuel type and the regulatory regime under which they might operate. This included key assumptions that
each generating unit will be available for operation until 2039 (consistent with the estimated asset life of the Drax Power Station), that
the outcome of the ongoing EU State aid investigation into the CfD for the third unit conversion would be favourable with a strike price
consistent with the initial decision published in January 2015 (£100/MWh) and that, where required to support future renewable
generation upon expiry of the current support mechanisms in 2027, a suitable level of economic incentive would be available to
maintain commercially acceptable returns.

When making these assumptions the enhancement value available from converting three of the generating units from their current coal
fuel source to biomass was not included in the value in use results. As a result, the majority of the CGU’s longer term revenues are
delivered by the biomass units.


Where available, estimates of future prices were based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties. Transactions
beyond contracted positions were valued using forward price curves and, beyond the liquid portion of observable market curves,
these were constructed internally. A benchmarking exercise confirmed that management’s constructed curves were in line with
market consensus.

The calculations were discounted using a post-tax nominal rate of 8%. This indicated that the recoverable amount of each of the Group’s
CGUs exceeded its carrying value and therefore that no provisions for impairment were required.

The calculations for each CGU are sensitive to the key assumptions described above. Material adverse changes to these assumptions,
particularly a delay in the EU State aid approval process or reduction in strike price for the CfD, the loss of existing economic support, the
lack of adequate economic support for renewable generation post-2027 or any other evidence that the useful lives of assets may be
materially shorter than assumed, could result in significant impairment charges in future periods.


Asset obsolescence charges
Obsolescence charges have been recognised in 2015, in respect of specific assets as described below:

Years ended 31 December


2015

2014
£000


Generation:

Property, plant and equipment 102.6 –


Biomass Supply:

Property, plant and equipment 6.6 –

Total asset obsolescence charges recognised in the income statement 109.2 –


Following an internal review and extensive testing, during 2015 it was concluded that Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) technology was no
longer required on converted biomass units within the Generation business and the assets were decommissioned. The recoverable amount
of these assets was determined to be zero and accordingly the full carrying amount of £92.6 million has been recognised as an asset
obsolescence charge in the year.

During 2015 we began to install Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction technology across our generating units as part of our strategy to
ensure compliance with the requirements of the IED. As a result, development costs associated with a competing solution were determined
to have a recoverable amount of zero, as the project would not be progressed. The full carrying amount of £10.0 million has therefore been
recognised as an asset obsolescence charge in the year.

Within the Biomass Supply business, following a decision not to proceed with a third pellet plant project in the US Gulf, the recoverable
amount of the associated assets was determined to be zero and the full carrying amount of £6.6 million recognised as an asset
obsolescence charge.

2.4 Net finance costs
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bank loans) as well as foreign
exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives (see
note 5.3) and net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by interest
income that we generate through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds.

Amortisation of deferred finance costs includes £0.7 million of costs (2014: £nil) relating to the previous revolving credit facility for
which amortisation was accelerated following the successful renegotiation of a replacement facility in December 2015 (see note 4.4
for further details).

2.5 Current and deferred taxation
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount payable on this year’s taxable profits (which
are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and
therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is
expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules (reflected in differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits). The tax
charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 and the movement
in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on taxable profit for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable profit
differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items income or expense that are either taxable or
deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be
paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. In the Summer Budget 2015, the UK
corporation tax main rate has been set by the Finance Act at 19% for the years starting 1 April 2017, 2018 and 2019 and at 18% for the year
starting 1 April 2020. These rates have therefore been reflected in the deferred tax balances shown below.

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity respectively.

Significant judgement areas
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made
for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax
assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by
a business unit, particularly those with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support
recognitionoftherelateddeferredtaxasset

###### Section 2: Financial Performance continued

2.5 Current and deferred taxation continued
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £19 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: £10 million) in respect of
UK and US losses that are carried forward against future taxable income. In both cases the business units involved have a history of making
losses and until sufficient operational performance is established and maintained to give suitable confidence in future profitability, taxable
income against which to utilise the benefit of the accumulated losses is not considered to be probable.

2.6 Earnings per share and underlying earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that are attributable to each ordinary share we have
in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during
the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be issued under our employee share
schemes – see note 6.2), that are currently expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary shares
as at the balance sheet date.

In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated (note 2.7).
Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of unrealised gains on derivative contracts, asset obsolescence charges and the one-off
settlement of CESP in 2014 from earnings. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for the period.

Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

of these cash resources are held by the principal operating subsidiaries of the Group, in particular Drax Power Limited.

The Parent Company financial statements, set out on pages 146 to 151 of this report, disclose the Parent Company’s distributable
reserves of £222 million. Following a reorganisation of the subsidiary companies undertaken during the year (described in note 4 to the
Parent Company financial statements) the wider Group has, relative to previous dividend payments (note 2.7), sufficient retained profits
available for future distributions in accordance with the Group divided policy.

###### Section 3: Operating Assets and Working Capital
This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the
short-term liquid assets and liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our
working capital balances.

3.1 Property, plant and equipment
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to
generate revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset
over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful
economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.

Additions in 2015 include a further £90 million (2014: £125 million) on our biomass transformation project, which is now largely complete
and in line with initial expectations on timing and overall cost. At Drax Power Station we now have two fully converted units running on
biomass fuel with a third operating as an enhanced co-fired unit burning up to 90% biomass. Upstream, in our US-based wood pellet
manufacturing business, both pellet plant facilities and the port facility commenced commercial operations during the year.

Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and
rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and
restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment
in value.

We construct many of our assets ourselves as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are
not depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the
assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station). The table below
shows the range of useful lives and the average useful life of an asset in the main categories of asset we own in years:

UEL (range)

Freehold buildings 14–32

Plant and machinery

Electricity generation plant 2–32

Pellet production plant 5–25

Other plant 2–30

Decommissioning asset 35

Plant spare parts Up to 35

Freehold land, held at cost, is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.

Within the plant and machinery categories shorter lives are attributed to assets that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling
outage cycles. Within the Electricity generation plant category the majority of the remaining net book value relates to assets with UELs
greater than 25 years. Within the pellet production plant category the majority of the remaining net book value relates to assets with
UELs greater than 20 years.

Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and
technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.

Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Critical judgement areas
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices prevailing at each balance sheet date. The
carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment (see note 2.3) where there has been a trigger event
(that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net
realisable value compared with net book value. The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on
management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is therefore subjective. Estimated useful lives are based on
past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence; however an inherent degree of judgement remains.

3.2 ROC and LEC assets
We earn ROC and LEC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”), as a result of burning
renewable biomass to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of such assets we have earned but not yet sold.

As we generate more of our electricity by burning renewable biomass, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC assets we
generate will increase. Haven Power provides us with a credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs.

Following the government’s decision to remove the CCL exemption for power generated from renewable sources, as of 1 August 2015 we no
longer earn LECs for electricity generated from renewable biomass. The remaining balance sheet value of LECs represents LECs earned
before 1 August 2015 which are yet to be sold to customers. We expect to recover the carrying amount of these LECs in full in 2016.

Accounting policy
ROCs and LECs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based
on anticipated sales prices. The value of ROCs and LECs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs
in that period.

Where our retail activities incur an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred.

At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC and LEC assets generated but not sold against updated anticipated sales
prices including, where relevant, agreed forward sale contracts and taking into account likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our
own ROC obligations. Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.

Critical judgement areas
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs and LECs referred to above are calculated with reference to assumptions regarding
future sales prices in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates
that the assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable; however actual sales prices may differ.

ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the recycle fund at the end of the compliance
period, where Supplier buy out charges (incurred by Suppliers who do not procure sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are returned
to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. Such estimates are subject to assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and
supply over the compliance period and thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to
its own forecasts in calculating these estimates. Past experience indicates the values arrived at are reasonable but remain subject to
possible variation.

3.3 Inventories
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity, and raw materials used in the
production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the
end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.

Accounting policy
Our fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.


The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including
the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism) and
transport/handling costs.

Critical judgement areas
Whilst value is largely based on observable costs, given the storage and handling characteristics of coal and biomass, an element of
judgement is inherent in calculating the volume of fuel stocks on site at any given time.


Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving around or exiting sites using technology regularly calibrated to
industry standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efficiency
calculations to provide closing stock volumes, with the most prudent valuation adopted in preparing financial statements. Both
calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error.

Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist, with a provision made where the
survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, the survey
depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.


The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass is stored in sealed domes with a carefully
controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes. Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR
scanning technology. However, this survey remains subject to a tolerable error range.

Experience indicates that the estimates and assumptions made by management in calculating stock volumes are reasonable. However,
the level of judgement and tolerable error range involved means that actual values may differ from initial calculations.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2015 was £1,306.9 million (2014: £1,224.8 million).

3.4 Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid
for. Other receivables include accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power
delivered that will be invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group for which we are yet to
receive the relevant goods or services in return (e.g. insurance premiums we have paid for in advance that will be utilised within the year).

Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established
subsequently where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms
of the receivable.

Trade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to a number of counterparties within both our generation and retail businesses.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had amounts receivable from two (2014: four) significant counterparties within the generation business,
representing 41% (2014: 68%) of trade receivables, both of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms.

Of total trade receivables at 31 December 2015, £41 million (2014: £34 million) relates to retail power sales. The risk profile of retail debt
is different from that of the generation business with a larger volume of counterparties, and hence a lower concentration of credit risk,
with different payment terms. All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk policies for indicators of impairment
and provisions made where appropriate. The value of retail debts that are past-due and not provided against, in accordance with this
assessment, is not material.

Accordingly, management does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the normal provision for doubtful
debts of £4.9 million (2014: £6.8 million). This provision, which largely relates to retail receivables, has been determined with reference to
past default experiences in line with our policies. Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.

The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

3.5 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers (for goods and services provided), tax authorities and other
creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for payment in
the future as a result of our activities in the current year (e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet been invoiced).

31 December 2015 include £10.0 million (2014: £12.2 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability to deliver CO2 emissions
allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.

###### Section 4: Financing and Capital Structure
This section gives further information regarding the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt
financing) and cash generated from operations during the year.

4.1 Reconciliation of net debt
Net debt is calculated by taking our borrowings (note 4.4) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2) and short-term
investments (note 4.3). The table below reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.

4.2 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other bank accounts that are accessible on demand. It is our policy to invest
available cash on hand in short-term, low risk bank or building society deposits.


As at 31 December

As at 31 December


2015
£m


2014
£m


Short-term investments – 40.1

4.4 Borrowings
Our financing structure includes £325 million of term loans, comprised of a private placement of £100 million with various funds managed
by M&G Investments, a £75 million amortising loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the
Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, a £50 million amortising term loan with Green Investment Bank and a £100 million amortising term
loan facility with M&G UK Companies Financing Fund. The loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025. All of the term
loans were fully drawn down at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.


In December 2015 we successfully refinanced our £400 million revolving credit facility. The new facility matures in December 2019 and
has a margin of 175 basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 2015 this facility had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total
value of £37.9 million (see note 7.5).

At the same time we also renewed our commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades
without the requirement to post collateral.

Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the
principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the
financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement
over the life of the instrument.


Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some
or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

Analysis of borrowings
Borrowings at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 consisted principally of amounts drawn down against bank loans.

4.6 Equity and reserves
Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares in issue, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.

Accounting policy
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its
liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from
the proceeds.

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 11[16]⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income. No
shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.


Shares issued under employee share schemes
On 26 January, 13 February and 24 February a total of 12,893 shares were issued on early vesting of the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan by
three individuals whose employment had terminated due to retirement. On 9 March 1,022,848 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares
vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan. Throughout March to June a total of 435,681 shares were issued
in satisfaction of options vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan. On 2 July 24,179 shares
were issued on early vesting of the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan by one individual whose employment terminated and discretion was used
to vest the shares.

Other reserves
The share premium account reflects amounts received in respect of issued share capital that exceed the nominal value of the shares issued.

Other equity reserves reflect the impact of certain historical transactions, which are described under the table below.

###### Section 5: Other Assets and Liabilities
This section includes all other assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, not covered
in other sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.

5.1 Acquisitions
On 4 March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Billington Bioenergy Limited (Billington Bioenergy), obtaining
control of the company. Billington Bioenergy is a wood pellet distributor in the UK renewable-fuelled heating market. It gives us an important
opportunity to work with the UK heat sector to ensure that the many benefits of biomass are fully understood. We hope to drive substantial
growth in this market over the coming years.

Accounting policy
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred and
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as
incurred. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable
net assets acquired.

The provisional amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Billington
Bioenergy are as set out in the table below:

£m

Financial assets 0.6

Inventory 0.3

Property, plant and equipment 0.9

Financial liabilities (1.6)

Total identifiable net assets 0.2

Goodwill 3.8

Total consideration paid in cash 4.0

The acquisition consideration of £4.0 million was settled entirely in cash, with no deferred or contingent consideration payable.
No cash or cash equivalents were acquired, therefore the net cash outflow on acquisition was £4.0 million.

Billington Bioenergy contributed revenues of £4.7 million and EBITDA of £nil to the results of the Group in the period between the
acquisition date and the balance sheet date.

5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business, when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. Our goodwill
relates to the acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 and Billington Bioenergy in 2015. Other intangibles include any amounts paid in respect
of carbon emission allowances for future years.

Accounting policy
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit to which it relates and the recoverable amount
for that cash-generating unit assessed.

Goodwill
Total goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2015 was £14.5 million, with £10.7 million arising on the acquisition of
Haven Power attributed to Haven Power and £3.8 million arising on the acquisition of Billington Bioenergy in the period (31 December
2014: £10.7 million entirely attributable to Haven Power Limited).

At 31 December 2015, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value reflecting the economic benefits from Haven
Power’s cash generative profile.


-----

5.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
The recoverable amount of Haven Power is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation. The key assumptions in this
calculation are the same as those used for the wider asset impairment review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2015 and are
disclosed in note 2.3.

Given the short time since the acquisition, management consider the fair value of Billington Bioenergy to be equivalent to the purchase
price, which was supported by an independent valuation.

Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated and required for the current financial
year and are recognised at cost, net of any impairment.

The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the
current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the extent further
purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.

5.3 Provisions
We make a provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and
remediating the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. The amount represents the present value (i.e. it is discounted to
reflect the time value of money) of the expected costs. Provisions are for liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount, and as such by
their nature are estimated.

Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value of the
expected costs. No allowance is made within the provision for expected proceeds on disposal of scrap or assets to third parties, as the
uncertainty over market prices at the estimated decommissioning date mean such an asset would not be virtually certain at the balance
sheet date. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built in risks
specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.


Reinstatement

Carrying amount:

At 1 January 2014 32.4

Unwinding of discount 1.1

At 1 January 2015 29.8

Unwinding of discount 0.7

At 31 December 2015 30.5


The initial provision and subsequent estimation changes are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and are being depreciated
over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs (note 2.4).

The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been estimated
using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent
update took place in 2014.

We operate two share option schemes for our employees – the Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) for directors and senior executives, and the
Savings-Related Share Option (SAYE) Plan for all qualifying employees. We incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our
income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of options outstanding.

Accounting policy
All of the Group’s share-based payments are equity-settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity
instrument at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares
that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

Bonus Matching Plan (BMP)
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other
senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus. A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the
Group’s TSR matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion of the
shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The fair value of the 2015, 2014 and
2013 BMP awards, of £3.3 million, £5.4 million and £6.1 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the corresponding three year vesting periods.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE)
In April 2015, participation in the SAYE Plan was offered again to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to
acquire shares at a price of 319 pence (2014: 530 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in
accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five year savings contracts. The fair value of the
options granted in connection with the SAYE Plan of £4.4 million (2014: £1.5 million) is being charged to the income statement over the
life of the relevant contracts.

Fair value of share-based payment awards
The fair value of share-based payment awards was determined as follows:


SIP – based on price paid at award dates;
BMP – Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting; and
SAYE – Black-Scholes model which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.

Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report.


6.3 Retirement benefit obligations
We operate a defined benefit and three defined contribution pension schemes.

The Drax Power Group section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme; a pension arrangement
under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically
entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three
times pension.


The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan are defined contribution
schemes, which provide a retirement benefit that is dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the scheme.

###### Section 6: Our People continued

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
Accounting policy
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to
the contributions.

For the defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains
and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately
in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Defined benefit
costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised within the
income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is
recognised within finance costs.

The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group in respect
of the current period.

Significant judgement areas
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including
discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually
and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are
reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ
from such assumptions.

The assumptions used in 2015 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with
independent actuarial advice received.

Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates three defined contribution schemes, The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan and
Drax Biomass inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are as follows:

Years ended 31 December

Total included in staff costs (note 6.1) 5.9 4.9

As at 31 December 2015, contributions of £0.4 million (2014: £0.4 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid
over to the schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

Defined benefit scheme
The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) was closed to new members as from 1 January
2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to
build up pension benefits as part of the scheme.

The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:

Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets
(equities, property and direct lending) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term,
create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains
appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.

Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this will
be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.

Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.

Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such higher inflation will
lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely
correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on
inflationary increases are in place, to protect against extreme inflation.

Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the government increasing
the burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members
with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death before retirement.

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 2013.
Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years. The next valuation will therefore take place on or before
31 March 2016.

The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted to 31 December 2015, taking into account experience
over the period since 31 March 2013, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic assumptions. The
present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost were measured using the projected unit credit
method. The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows:


As at 31 December


2015
% p.a.


2014
% p.a.


Discount rate 3.9 3.7

Inflation (RPI) 3.1 3.0

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0 2.8

Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.7 3.6

The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions are
that a member who retired in 2015 at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years (2014: 27 years) after retirement if they are male
and for a further 29 years (2014: 29 years) after retirement if they are female. Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for male and female
non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 28 years and 31 years respectively (2014: 28 years and 31 years respectively).


The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value
of the plan assets, determined as follows:

50% of assets are invested in liability-matching asset classes.
(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, government and absolute return bonds. 8% has a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower).
(3) Other assets include £8.0 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market.


-----

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets
are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market
principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative
to the actual asset allocation for the scheme.


The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a
potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity
of the pension deficit at 31 December 2015 to changes in these assumptions:


%


(Decrease)/Increase

£m


Discount rate – Increase 0.25 (11.3)

Inflation rate[(1)] – Increase 0.25 10.6

– Decrease 0.25 (10.0)


Life expectancy – Increase 1 year 6.8

– Decrease 1 year (6.8)


Note:
(1) The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation. The impact of corresponding decreases in these variables is
included here.

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions
where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.

###### Section 7: Risk Management
This section provides disclosures around financial risk management, including the financial instruments
we use to mitigate such risks.

7.1 Risk management disclosures
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk,
liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of
commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the risk management
committees as detailed in Principal risks and uncertainties (page 52) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.

Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable
biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the
financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.

The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so.
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow
exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.

The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities
from a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and
financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the
Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.

The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and
international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow
hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.

Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the
balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.

If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

– profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease/increase by £6.7 million (2014: decrease/increase by £9.4 million).
This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and
– the hedge reserve would decrease/increase by £11.5 million (2014: decrease/increase by £12.0 million) mainly as a result of the
changes in the fair value of financial coal and power derivatives.

Interest rate risk
Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate this risk
with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet
date; however this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to
interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided below.

Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance
sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date
was outstanding for the whole year.

If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for the
year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease/increase by £1.8 million (2014: decrease/increase by £1.4 million) as a result of the changes
in interest payable during the period.

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars, biomass purchases
in US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in Euros. As our biomass transformation plans have
progressed, we have entered into an increasing volume of forward foreign exchange contracts. Exchange rate exposures are managed
within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts.

Foreign currency sensitivity
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

– profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 would decrease/increase by £233.3 million/£241.1 million (2014: decrease/
increase by £261.0 million/£275.3 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts
entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts; and
– other equity reserves would increase/decrease by £67.8 million/£75.0 million (2014: increase/decrease by £48.7 million/£53.9 million)
as a result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.

7.1 Risk management disclosures continued
Liquidity risk
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group maintains a
mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.

The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include both
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest
rate curves at the balance sheet date.

The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market,
based on the undiscounted net cash inflows/(outflows). Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has

Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of fuel, sustainable biomass and other goods and services, it is exposed to the
risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and/or fails to deliver against the
contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers.

The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or
more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile
of the Group.

as summarised below:

As at 31 December

Financial assets:

Cash and cash equivalents 133.8 180.9

Short-term investments – 40.1

Trade and other receivables 324.2 375.5

1,067.2 846.8

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £4.9 million (2014: £6.8 million).

Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees. Where considered
appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of
charge, or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased credit default swaps.

The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage credit
risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.

Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity
(excluding the hedge reserve), plus net cash. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.4, cash and cash equivalents in note
4.2 and short-term investments in note 4.3.

Total shareholders’ equity, excluding hedge reserve 1,567.5 1,556.2

7.2 Derivative financial instruments
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and
CO2 emissions allowances) to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future electricity sales, and also financial contracts
(principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix sterling cash flows.

We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price risk, and
foreign currency risk (see note 7.1).

A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model. Our policy is to lock down exposures to commodity price
movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to
de-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future.

At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence
the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.

Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in
question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4).

Accounting policy
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair
value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase,
sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.

Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances
and forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, with
changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges

7.2 Derivative financial instruments continued
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets or
liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.

Total net gains in hedge reserve £23.4 million

Total net gains in income statement £123.7 million


Critical judgement areas
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price
curves. Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or
settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves
upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally
extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future
prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued using an option
pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and
assumptions around volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market
movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.

Fair value accounting
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, financial
coal, financial oil, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market and recorded
in the balance sheet at fair value as follows:

7.2 Derivative financial instruments continued
The total movement in the fair value of these contracts of £147.1 million (2014: £166.2 million loss) is recognised in the income statement
or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows:

Years ended 31 December


2015
£m


2014
£m


Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 123.7 65.8

Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in the hedge reserve (note 7.4) 23.4 100.4

Total unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts 147.1 166.2

Unrealised gains in the income statement in 2015 are primarily the result of changes in the fair value of our forward currency exchange
contracts. We maintain a substantial foreign currency hedging programme to secure the sterling cost of future purchases of fuel in
foreign currencies, principally denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The high volume of contracts held (demonstrated
in the table on page 137) means low levels of exchange rate volatility can have a significant impact on amounts recognised in our income
statement in respect of these contracts. The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are
denominated in US dollars. The overall strengthening of the US dollar against sterling during 2015 resulted in further significant
unrealised gains in the current year.

During 2015 the liquid portion of the forward power curve contracted and as a result we extended the use of longer-dated contracts to sell
gas as a proxy for power hedging. Whilst the correlation is strong, the hedge is not perfect and thus we do not apply hedge accounting to
these contracts. Falling market gas prices during 2015 have contributed further gains to the income statement as our hedged positions are
at a price that is better than could be achieved in the market as at the balance sheet date.

These gains were partially offset by unrealised losses on our financial oil purchase contracts as a result of the continuing decline in oil
prices during 2015. We utilise financial contracts to fix oil indexation in fuel purchase contracts.

Unrealised gains recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains on the portion of our forward currency exchange contracts
that are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39 and forward contracts for the sale of power which have
increased in value relative to the market as price weakness continued in 2015.

Fair value measurement

– Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not excluded
through the own use exemption, are calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are
generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for
financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
– Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is
determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
– Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not
excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts
are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.

The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain
embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and
therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.

Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant
to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows:
Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair value of both commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by comparison
between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.

There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.

7.3 Other financial instruments
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and
receivables arising from our operations.

Accounting policy
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), short-term investments (note 4.3), trade and other receivables (note 3.4), and trade and other
payables (note 3.5) generally have short times to maturity. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate
to their fair value. The Group’s borrowings (note 4.4) relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts
of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.


7.4 Hedge reserve
Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to the extent
that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related
contracts mature, and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.

As described in note 7.2, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging; however not all of these
contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS
effective hedge are recognised in the income statement. Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down
exposures to moving prices and securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.

The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk
management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging
instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Changes in fair value of
contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency
exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked to market at each period end
for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then
released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the
underlying power is delivered. For FX contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised. Further
information about the Group’s accounting for financial instruments is included in note 7.2.

7.5 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control.
The amount and timing of any payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely.

Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)
The UK government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males.
This would correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group (note 6.3). At present, the methodology for
implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no allowance has been made for
GMP equalisation in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated financial statements.

Borrowings
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of
banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2015 the Group’s contingent
liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £37.9 million (2014: £50.5 million).

Invoices subject to dispute resolution
At the balance sheet date, the Group was engaged in a commercial dispute resolution process relating to certain invoices received for the
year ending 31 December 2015. No entries have been made in the financial statements in respect of these items as the existence and
value of any potential liability remains uncertain. Under the terms of our contract the Group is entitled to withhold payment until the
dispute is resolved.

7.6 Commitments
We have a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not recorded
in our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and
biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

###### Section 8: Reference Information
This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general
information about the Group (e.g. operations and registered office). We also set out the basis of
preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note.

8.1 General information
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries
(together, the Group) have three principal activities:


– Electricity generation;
– Electricity supply to business customers;
– Manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.

The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US. The Group
also operates in the UK domestic heat market.

The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH,
United Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 4 to the Company’s separate financial statements,
which follow these consolidated financial statements.


8.2 Basis of preparation
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In 2015, one new, amended or revised standard became effective. The Group adopted the following standard from 1 January 2015:

Annual improvements to 2011-2013 Cycle.


The adoption of this standard has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which
have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement
by the EU - marked by *):


IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.*

IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.*


IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.*

Annual improvements to 2012-2014 Cycle – all amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.


IFRS 11 (amended) – Joint Arrangements – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 16 (amended) – Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 (amended) Intangible Assets – applicable to annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2016.


IAS 27 (amended) – Separate Financial Statements – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) –
effective date deferred indefinitely.*

IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.


IAS 12 (amended) – Income Taxes – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.*

IAS 7 (amended) – Statement of Cash Flows - effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.*

IAS 19 (amended) – Defined Benefit Plans: Employee contributions – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
1 February 2015.


The Group is in the process of assessing the full impact of adopting IFRS 9, which may materially change the presentation of derivative
financial instruments held by the Group and accounted for at fair value. The Group currently intends to adopt the standard in the earliest
permitted accounting period, subject to endorsement by the EU.

The Group is also in the process of assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 15 and IFRS 16; however at this stage neither standard is
expected to have a material impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of amounts within the financial statements. The
Group currently expects to adopt these standards in the period they become mandatory, subject to EU endorsement.


Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

###### Section 8: Reference Information continued

8.3 Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below are considered to be general to the financial statements and not covered by a specific note.

Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and
other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between Group companies.

Revenues from the sale of electricity are measured based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing
market rates as applicable.

Revenues from sales of ROCs and LECs are stated at the invoiced value, net of VAT. Revenue is recognised when the ROC or LEC is
transferred to the account of that third party.

Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated as giving rise
to revenue. Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange is treated as giving rise to
revenue. The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents
received or paid. If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value
of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid.

Revenue from the sale of electricity directly to customers through our retail business, Haven Power, is recorded after deduction of agreed
discounts, VAT and CCL. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable
price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied,
but not yet measured or billed, is calculated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates.

Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction and from the
translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, are recognised in the income statement within
finance costs.

Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated to sterling using published
exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenditure of such operations are translated to sterling using the exchange rate
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of the operating net assets
and the results for the year are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.


-----

8.4 Related party transactions
A related party is either an individual with control or significant influence over the Group, or a company that is linked to us by investment
or a related individual. Our primary related parties are our key management personnel.

Remuneration of key management personnel
The remuneration of the Executive Committee members, who are considered to be the key management personnel of the Group, is set
out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24 “Related party disclosures”. Further information about the
remuneration of individual directors, together with the directors’ interests in the share capital of Drax Group plc, is provided in the audited
part of the Remuneration Committee report.

##### Independent auditor’s report to the members of Drax Group plc


###### Opinion on financial statements of Drax Group plc

In our opinion:


, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as
at 31 December 2014 and of the group’s profit for the year
then ended;

, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;


framework that has been applied in the preparation of the
parent Company financial statements is applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Going concern


As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the
directors’ statement that the Group is a going concern,
contained within the operational and financial performance
review. We confirm that:

, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate; and


, the parent Company financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation.


The financial statements comprise the Consolidated income
statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, the Consolidated and parent company balance sheets,
the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Consolidated
statement of changes in equity, the related Group notes 1 to 36
and the related parent Company only notes 1 to 8. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation
of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting


, we have not identified any material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern

However, because not all future events or conditions can be
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern.


Our assessment of risks of material misstatement

The assessed risks of material misstatement described below
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of
the engagement team and are the same risks as identified in
the prior year.


We reviewed management assumptions over the carrying
value and useful economic life of key assets by consideration
of internal and external available data. We challenged
management’s assumptions in estimating the useful economic
lives of existing and new assets capitalised in the year based
on our knowledge of the business.

key accounting policy judgements are included in note 3.

On a sample basis we also received external stock confirmation
for stocks held off site.


Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts
or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and
we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.

Our application of materiality

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of
our work.

We determined materiality for the Group to be £6.1 million
(2013: £10 million), which is approximately 5% (2013: 7%) of
adjusted pre-tax profit, and below 1% (2013: 1%) of equity. Pretax profit has been adjusted by excluding the effect of volatility
from unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts and
the one-off CESP settlement (as described in note 2) from our
determination. Adjusted pre-tax profit is an appropriate base
for determining materiality as shareholders place significant
value on the income statement, adjusted for these items.
The percentage applied to adjusted pre-tax profit has been
reduced to align more closely with comparable companies.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.1 million
(2013: £0.2 million), as well as differences below that threshold
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters


An overview of the scope of our audit

Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of
the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls,
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group
level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit
scope primarily on the audit work at three locations (2013:
the same three locations), being Drax Power, Haven Power
and Drax Biomass. All of these were subject to a full audit.
These three locations represent the principal business units
and account for all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit
before tax. They were also selected to provide an appropriate
basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material
misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the three
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to
each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality
and ranged from £2.9 million to £5.5 million (2013: £5.0 million
to 8.5 million).

At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation
process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material
misstatement of the aggregated financial information of
the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of
specified account balances.

The Group audit team follow a programme of planned visits
that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor
visits the most significant locations where the Group audit
scope was focused at least once a year. In years when we
do not visit a significant component we will include the
component audit partner in our team briefing, discuss their risk
assessment and review documentation of the findings from

Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to
you if, in our opinion:

, we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit; or

, adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or


As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities
statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control
1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to
ensure that our quality control procedures are effective,
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems
include our dedicated professional standards review team and
independent partner reviews.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we
might state to the Company’s members those matters we
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.


, the parent Company financial statements are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters

Directors’ remuneration


Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report
if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from
these matters.

Corporate governance statement


Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the
part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the
Company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from
our review.

Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report


Scope of the audit of the financial statements

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the
parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition,
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the
Annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the
audited financial statements and to identify any information
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the
implications for our report.


Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland),
we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information
in the annual report is:

, materially inconsistent with the information in the audited
financial statements; or

, apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired
in the course of performing our audit; or

Drax Group plc
Annual report and accounts 2014

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements


Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries
(together the “Group”) predominantly operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK. The address of the
Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom.
The principal operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 4 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which
follow these consolidated financial statements. The principal activities of the Group are the sourcing of fuel from both domestic
and international sources, the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market at Drax Power Station, and the sale of
retail electricity to business consumers by Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”).

###### 2 Basis of preparation


This section describes the accounting standards we have followed in preparing these financial statements and the
interpretation of accounting standards into accounting policies which are relevant to our Group. Wherever possible, we have
explained how our accounting policies work in practice within the relevant note to the consolidated financial statements,
and have not sought to repeat that information here.


The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as explained in Operational and financial performance
on page 44, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value.


###### Basis of consolidation

These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by
the Company, (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. The company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries
consolidated within these financial statements.


The impact of all intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.

###### Accounting policies


Those accounting policies that are material to the understanding of our financial statements have been incorporated within
the relevant note or are set out below:

Revenue recognition


Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts,
VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between group companies.

Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or
prevailing market rates as applicable.


Revenues from sales of ROCs and LECs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT. Revenue is recognised when the risks and
rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party, that being when the ROC or LEC is transferred to the
account of that third party.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 2. Basis of preparation (continued)

Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated as giving
rise to revenue. Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange is treated as
giving rise to revenue. The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash
or cash equivalents received or paid. If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue
is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received
or paid.

Revenue from the sale of electricity directly to customers through our retail business, Haven Power is recorded after deduction of
agreed discounts, VAT and Climate Change Levy. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply
has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered
at the point of sale. Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed, is calculated based on consumption statistics and selling
price estimates.

Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction and from
the translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, are recognised in the income
statement within finance costs.

Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated to sterling using
published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such operations are translated to sterling using
the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of
these operations are recognised in reserves.

Community Energy Saving Programme (“CESP”)

As described in Operating and financial performance on page 39, during the year the Group reached settlement with Ofgem
regarding its non-compliance with CESP.

As settlement has been agreed at the balance sheet date, full provision has been made in the financial statements for the
anticipated economic flows. Trade and other payables include an accrual for the £25 million cash settlement due to Ofgem and
National Energy Action. Trade and other receivables include an income accrual for the £5 million settlement reached with a
third party for related breach of contract.

Recognising the materiality of the settlement to the Group in both quantitative and qualitative terms, the net settlement has been
presented separately on the face of the income statement.

The settlement with Ofgem incorporates £3 million of additional remedies that will be delivered by a third party as further
consumer redress measures. This represents the settlement of an obligation with services and has no financial impact on the
Group. Accordingly no entries have been made in the financial statements in respect of this element of the transaction.

As a transaction that is one-off in nature and does not reflect the ongoing operational performance of the Group, the impact
of the CESP settlement has been excluded from our non-statutory financial performance measures, including EBITDA and
underlying profit.

Non-statutory measures of financial performance

We present two non-statutory measures on the face of the income statement. Our non-statutory measures exclude certain items,
including any transactions considered to be one-off in nature, to provide a measure of the underlying trading and operational
performance of the Group.

EBITDA is the primary measure we use to assess our financial performance. EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts. In 2014, it excludes the one-off settlement of
CESP described above.

Underlying measures, including underlying profit before and after tax and underlying earnings per share (EPS) exclude the impact
of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and, in 2014, the one-off settlement of CESP. Underlying profit after tax and
EPS exclude the post-tax effect of these items.

Under our current distribution policy, dividends are calculated based upon 50% of underlying profit after tax. A reconciliation from
profit for the year attributable to equity holders to underlying profit after tax is provided in note 9.

Adoption of new and revised accounting standards

In 2014, a number of new, amended or revised standards and interpretations became effective. The Group adopted the following
standards from 1 January 2014:


IAS 32 (amended) – Offsetting financial assets and liabilities.

IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated financial statements.


IFRS 12 (amended) – Disclosure of interests in other entities.

IAS 27 (revised) – Separate financial statements.


IAS 36 (amended) – Impairment of Assets.

IAS 39 (amended) – Financial Instruments: Recognition & Measurement.


IFRIC 12 (interpretation) – Levies.

The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

The disclosures required by IFRS 12 in respect of the Group’s interest in Capture Power Limited have been included at note 12.


At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not
been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement
by the EU):

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.


IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.

IAS 19 (amended) – Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1
February 2015.


Annual improvements to 2010-2012 Cycle – all amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1
February 2015.

Annual improvements to 2011-2013 Cycle – all amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1
January 2015.

Annual improvements to 2012-2014 Cycle – all amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July
2016.


IFRS 11 (amended) – Joint Arrangements – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 16 (amended) – Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 (amended) Intangible Assets– applicable to annual reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IAS 27 (amended) – Separate Financial Statements – applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) –
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.


IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1
January 2016.

The Group is in the process of assessing the full impact of adopting IFRS 9 . The Group currently intends to adopt the standard in
the earliest permitted accounting period, subject to endorsement by the EU.


Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of
the Group.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 3 Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions


The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect
the values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of income and expenditure recorded during the period. These estimates
are based on our reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions that require judgement, but the actual amount may
ultimately differ from the initial or subsequent estimates.


Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The most important of these judgements – those that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that differs from the amount
recognised in the financial statements – are as follows:

Property, plant and equipment – Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices
prevailing at each balance sheet date. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment
where there has been a trigger event (that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value
of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value. The calculation of estimated future cash
flows and residual values is based on management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is therefore
subjective. Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence; however
an inherent degree of judgement remains.

Derivatives – Derivative financial instruments are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value
of derivatives are recorded for each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The fair values of
derivative instruments for commodities and foreign exchange rates are determined using forward price curves. Forward price
curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement
of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon
readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally
extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how
future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued
using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option,
discount rate and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future
transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.

ROCs and LECs – ROCs and LECs are stated within the balance sheet at fair value on the date of recognition and subsequently
written down to net realisable value where appropriate. Inherent in the calculation of this fair value and in the estimate of net
realisable value is an assumption regarding future sales prices in the market. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions
used in the valuation are reasonable; however actual sales prices may differ.

Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

Pensions – The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the
projected unit credit method and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet
date. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases,
and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that
the assumptions utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions
and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.

Taxation – In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure
for tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with
advisers. Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have
been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be
recovered, taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting income streams.

Impairment – The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy
detailed in note 10. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates.

Inventories – Fuel inventories are valued on a weighted average cost basis according to invoiced purchase prices, limited to net
realisable value where appropriate. The quantum of fuel on-site is calculated using a number of complementary methodologies
with the most prudent adoption for financial accounting purposes. Whilst value is largely based on observable costs, an element
of judgement remains in determining the requirement, if any, for a provision against stock values based on available data such as
market price trends and independent stock surveys and also in determining appropriate values in respect of fuel received but not
invoiced at the balance sheet date.

###### 4 Segmental reporting

We view our operational business as two distinct areas – or segments – the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station
(“Generation”) and the supply of power to business customers (“Retail”). The respective financial performance of these
segments is shown here (and described in far greater detail in Operational and financial performance on pages 32 to 37).
The costs incurred by our US business, which is still in the development phase, during the current and previous year have been
included in the Generation segment.

The Generation business segment spans all three core activities of the Group in that it incorporates sourcing of coal, biomass
and other fuels, generation and supply (through its sales to the wholesale electricity market).

The Retail business segment contributes to the supply activities of the Group, through sales direct to the small and medium
enterprise and industrial and commercial markets.

Grow our retail business… Haven Power, our retail business, has demonstrated strong sales volume growth in the current and
previous year.

Information reported to the Board and for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is organised
into two operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment, presented to the Board on a regular
basis, is EBITDA.

Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the
management accounts, and accordingly no separate asset disclosure is made here. However, spend on key capital projects
is monitored. Total spend on the biomass transformation project during 2014 was £125 million (2013: £228 million), of which
£85 million (2013: £117 million) relates to construction of assets within our US business.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements. The revenue and results of both reporting segments presented are subject to
seasonality as detailed in Operational and financial performance, page 44.

Major customers

Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 includes amounts of £320.6million and £288.7 million (2013: £222.3 million)
derived from two customers (2013: single customer), each representing 10% or more of the Group’s revenue for the year.
These revenues arose in the generation segment.

###### 7 Taxation


The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the amount payable on this year’s taxable profits (which
are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in some cases for items upon which we are required to pay
additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more
or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules.


The tax charge/(credit) reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December
2014 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not
that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

In light of the complex nature of the CESP settlement, there is currently uncertainty as to the likely level of any tax deduction
available for the net settlement cost, on this basis no tax relief has been recognised in respect of this matter in these
financial statements.

###### 8 Dividends


Dividends are amounts we return to our shareholders and are paid as an amount per ordinary share held. Our current dividend
policy is to return 50% of underlying earnings (see note 9) to our shareholders each year. The remaining 50% is retained for
reinvestment in the future growth of the business.

55.0 78.8


At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve
payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 7.2 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £29.0 million)
payable on or before 15 May 2015. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2014.

###### 9 Earnings per share


Earnings per share (“EPS”) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that are attributable to each ordinary share
we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were
in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be issued under
our employee share schemes – see note 26), that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and
treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.

In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated
(note 8). Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of fair value movements on derivative contracts and the CESP
settlement, incurred in 2014, from earnings. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for
the period.

###### 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets


Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business, when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired.
All of our goodwill relates to the acquisition of Haven Power, our retail business, in 2009. Other intangibles include any amounts
paid in respect of carbon emission allowances for future years.

Goodwill

Goodwill arising on the Haven Power acquisition has been allocated to the Haven Power cash-generating unit. At 31 December
2014, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value reflecting Haven Power’s cash generative profile.
Sensitivity analysis performed over the goodwill balance indicates the level of change required is beyond what would be
considered reasonably possible. Accordingly this sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed.

The recoverable amount of Haven Power is calculated annually, based on a value in use calculation. The key assumptions in
this calculation relate to the discount rate and future cash flows. Management estimates the discount rate using a pre-tax rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business. The first five years of
cash flows are based upon the five year Business Plan approved by the Board. Future cash flows have been taken in perpetuity,
assuming no growth rate is applied to the final year of the Business Plan. The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows
from Haven Power is 8% reflecting a reasonable assumption of the applicable cost of capital.

Carbon assets

Carbon assets arise upon the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated and required for the
current financial year and are recognised at cost, net of any impairment.

The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation
for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the
extent further purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.

###### 11

Delivering our biomass strategy…

Accounting policy


Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts
and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable
of operating in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and
removing the item and restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
provision for impairment in value. Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives
of the assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station).
The estimated useful lives, beginning in 2004 when they were reset, are currently:


Years

Main generating plant and freehold buildings Up to 35

Other plant and machinery 3-25

Decommissioning asset 35

Plant spare parts 35


Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence
as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance
sheet date.

Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

###### 11. Property, plant and equipment (continued)

Impairment

At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that
these assets may have suffered an impairment loss. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference
to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset (value in use) or sales value net of expenses. If an asset is
impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount. The discount rate applied
to future cash flows for this purpose is a pre-tax rate based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects the
current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.

###### 12 Investments in joint ventures

Capture Power Limited (“CPL”) is the company responsible for the development, implementation and operation of the proposed
White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage (“CCS”) project. The Group holds a 33% investment in CPL. This note explains how our
investment in CPL is accounted for and how the financial position and performance of CPL affects that of the Group. CPL is
currently conducting a Front End Engineering and Design study which is expected to conclude around the end of 2015. Drax
has committed £4 million in funding to support this process, £3 million of which was incurred and recognised in operating
expenditure within 2014.

Committed to sustainability… CPL represents an integral part of our commitment towards a low carbon economy.

Carbon capture and
Capture Power Limited storage development England & Wales 33% 33%


Our investment in Capture Power Limited of £1 (2013: £1) is accounted for using the equity method in these consolidated financial
statements as the Group exerts significant influence by virtue of its ownership interest. Under the equity method, the group’s
initial investment is recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the investee. Where the Group’s
share of losses exceeds the Group’s interest, recognition of losses is discounted with further losses only recognised to the extent
that the Group has incurred a legal or constructive obligation or made payments on behalf of the investee.

Based upon relevant management information, prepared in accordance with IFRS, as at 31 December 2014, Capture Power
Limited held net liabilities of £7.4 million (2013: £nil) and incurred a loss for the year there-ended of £7.4 million (2013: £nil) reflecting
the commencement of operations early in 2014 and the developmental activities undertaken in the year. The Group’s share of
losses for the year was therefore £2.5 million (2013: £nil). Accordingly, the Group’s net investment in Capture Power Limited is fully
written down with a carrying value in these financial statements of £nil, and therefore there is no entry in the Balance Sheet.
The unrecognised portion of the Group’s share of losses, both for the year and cumulatively, is £2.5 million. The Group received no
dividends from Capture Power Limited during the year.

###### 13 Inventories


We hold stocks of fuels and other consumables that we use in the process of generating electricity. This note shows the cost of
coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, and
those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.

Our fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.


The cost of fuel stocks includes the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the
UK carbon price support mechanism) and transport/handling costs.

Delivering our biomass strategy… The increasing cost of carbon, including the carbon price support mechanism, added
£56 million to our fuel costs in 2014. The relative economics of coal and biomass generation going forward underpins our
transformation strategy, as biomass margins are more favourable than coal margins.

###### 14 ROC and LEC assets

We earn ROC and LEC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”), as a result of
burning renewable biomass to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of such assets we have earned but not yet sold.

Delivering our biomass strategy and growing our retail business… As we generate more of our electricity by burning renewable
biomass, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC and LEC assets we generate will increase. As Haven Power grows, it
provides us with a credit-efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs and LECs.

ROCs and LECs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and initially measured at fair value based
on anticipated sales prices. At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC and LEC assets generated but
not sold against updated anticipated sales prices. Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the
period incurred.

###### 15 Trade and other receivables


Trade and other receivables represents amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not
yet been paid for. The note includes accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in
respect of power delivered that will be invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group
for which we are yet to receive the relevant goods or service in return (e.g. insurance premiums we have paid for that will be
utilised within the year).


Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is
established subsequently where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according
to the original terms of the receivable.

###### 15. Trade and other receivables (continued)


Of total trade receivables at 31 December 2014, £34 million (2013: £18 million) relates to retail power sales. The risk profile of
retail debt is different to that of the generation business with a larger volume of counterparties, and hence lower concentration
of credit risk, of varying size with different payment terms. All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk
policies for indicators of impairment and provisions made where appropriate. The value of retail debts that are past-due and not
provided against, in accordance with this assessment are not material.

Accordingly management does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the normal provision
for doubtful debts of £6.8 million (2013: £5.6 million). This provision, which relates entirely to retail receivables, has been
determined with reference to past default experiences in line with our policies. Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in
further detail in note 22.

note 2, accruals also reflect £25 million in respect of the Group’s obligations under the settlement of CESP agreed with Ofgem in
November 2014.

The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU ETS.
Accruals at 31 December 2014 include £12.2 million (2013: £9.2 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability to deliver
CO2 emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.

###### 19 Borrowings


Borrowings are chiefly comprised of bank loans with fixed maturity repayment profiles between 2016 and 2025.

Maximising the value of the Group… In April 2013, we agreed a new £75 million amortising term loan facility with Friends Life,
underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme. This replaced £50 million of
the £100 million facility with the UK Green Investment Bank agreed in 2012.

In May 2014, we agreed a new private placement for £100 million with various funds managed by M&G investments.

The new loan facilities, which were fully drawn at the year end, enhance the financing structure executed in previous years
by providing additional liquidity and a smoother profile of debt maturities.


The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at the fair value, which equates
to the principal value, of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable
to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, amortised through
the income statement over the life of the instrument.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

###### 20 Derivative financial instruments


We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, coal, sustainable
biomass and CO2 emissions allowances) to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future electricity sales, and also
financial contracts (principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix sterling cash flows.

We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price
risk, and foreign currency risk (see note 22).


The accounting rules for derivative contracts are complex. At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain
exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have
secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time. Changes in fair value are recognised
either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question qualifies as an
effective hedge under IFRS (see note 28).

Managing our principal risks and uncertainties… A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model.
Our policy is to lock down exposures to commodity price movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative
contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to de-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash
flows into the future.


Accounting policy

Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from
fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own
purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.


Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption – principally power, financial coal, CO2 emissions allowances and
forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value,
with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 28) to the extent that the contracts are designated as
effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met.

Total unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts 166.2 (168.9)

Unrealised gains in the income statement in 2014 are primarily the result of changes in the fair value of our forward currency
exchange contracts. We undertook an extensive currency hedging programme in the prior year to secure the sterling cost of
fuel purchases made in foreign currencies. The high volume of contracts held (demonstrated in the table on page 126) means
low levels of exchange rate volatility can have a significant impact on amounts recognised in our income statement in respect
of these contracts. The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are denominated
in US dollars. The strengthening of the US dollar against sterling during 2014 offset previous losses driven by weakening during
previous periods, resulting in significant unrealised gains in the current year.

These were offset by unrealised losses on our financial oil contracts as a result of falling oil prices in the final quarter of 2014.
We utilise financial contracts to fix oil indexation in fuel purchase contracts.

Unrealised gains recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains on the portion of our forward currency exchange
contracts that are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39 and forward contracts for the sale of
power which have increased in value relative to the market as prices fell in the second half of 2014.

###### 20. Derivative financial instruments (continued)


Fair value measurement

, Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not
excluded through the own use exemption, are calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted
market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the
current ask price.


, Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts
is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.

, Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments,
not excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.


The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.

The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to
contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host
contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.


Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows:

Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities;

Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and


Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The fair value of both commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by
comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.


There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.

###### 21 Other financial instruments


We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and
receivables arising from our operations.


Fair value

Cash and cash equivalents (note 17), short-term investments (note 16), trade and other receivables (note 15), and trade and other
payables (note 18) generally have short times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate to their fair value.
The Group’s borrowings (note 19) relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of which
approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.

##### Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)

###### 22 Financial risk disclosures


IFRS require us to provide information that assists you in understanding the nature and extent of risks arising from the financial
instruments we hold, described in the two previous notes. Such risks include liquidity, credit and counterparty risk.

We also describe below the wider financial risks that we manage using financial instruments, for example how derivative
contracts minimise our exposure to commodity market and foreign currency risk.


Risk

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk,
liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability
of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the risk
management committees as detailed in Principal risks and uncertainties (page 46) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial
risks in close co-operation with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.

Commodity price risk

The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal,
sustainable biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have
historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.

The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so.
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash
flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.

The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different
maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a
fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges
as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.

The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of
domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are
designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2
emissions allowances.

Commodity price sensitivity

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items
at the balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.

If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:

, profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2014 would increase/decrease by £9.4 million (2013: increase/decrease by
£6.3 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to financial coal and oil derivatives; and

, the hedge reserve would decrease/increase by £12.0 million (2013: decrease/increase by £27.0 million) mainly as a result of the
changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power.

Interest rate risk

Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate
this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at
the balance sheet date; however this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information about the Group’s
instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included below.

Interest rate sensitivity

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the
balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance
sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.

If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for
the year ended 31 December 2014 would decrease/increase by £1.4 million (2013: decrease/increase by £1.0 million) as a result of
the changes in interest payable during the period.

###### 22. Financial risk disclosures (continued)


Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered to hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars,
biomass purchases in US dollars, Canadian dollars and euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in euros. As our
biomass transformation plans have progressed, we have entered into an increasing volume of forward foreign exchange
contracts. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency
exchange contracts.


Foreign currency sensitivity

If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant,
the Group’s:


, profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2014 would decrease/increase by £261.0 million (2013: decrease/increase by
£198.9 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation
to fuel purchase contracts; and

, other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £48.7 million (2013: decrease/increase by £49.6 million) as a result of the
changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.


Liquidity risk

The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board
of directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for
business requirements.


The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include
both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from
interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by
the yield or other forward curves existing at the reporting date.

Counterparty risk

As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of fuel, sustainable biomass and other goods and services, it is exposed
to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and/or fails to deliver
against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers.

The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure
of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase
the risk profile of the Group.

Credit risk

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date,
as summarised below:

As at 31 December

2014 2013
£m £m

Financial assets:

Cash and cash equivalents 180.9 267.3

Short-term investments 40.1 20.0

Trade and other receivables 367.9 251.8

Derivative financial instruments 250.3 38.3


839.2 577.4


Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £6.8 million (2013: £5.6 million).

Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees.
Where considered appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee,
letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased credit
default swaps.

The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage
credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the
maturity profile.

Capital management

The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of
shareholders’ equity (excluding the hedge reserve), less net cash. Net cash is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash
and cash equivalents in note 17 and short-term investments in note 16.

###### 23 Provisions


We make a provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning, demolishing and remediating our
generation assets at the end of their useful economic lives. The amount represents the present value (i.e. it is discounted to
reflect the time value of money) of the expected costs. Provisions are for liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount,
and as such by their nature are estimated.


Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value
of the expected costs. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows
have built in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, plant
and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest
payable and similar charges.

The initial provision and subsequent estimation changes are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and are being
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs (note 6).

The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been
estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice, updated on a triennial basis.
The most recent update took place in 2014.

###### 24 Deferred tax


Deferred tax is principally an accounting adjustment to reflect the tax charges or credits that are expected to arise in the
future, as a result of differences between the accounting and tax rules relating to certain transactions that happened before
the end of the current year.


The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
offset as there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

profits is probable.

The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £10 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: £6.1 million)
in respect of UK and US losses that are carried forward against future taxable income, where recovery is not currently probable.

###### 25 Issued equity


Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares issued, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.


Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of
its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net
of tax, from the proceeds.

On 10 March 2014, a total of 2,126,934 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares vesting in accordance with the rules of the
Group’s Bonus Matching Plan granted in 2010. From 1 May 2014 a further 113,085 shares were issued in satisfaction of options
vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan, also granted in 2010. During 2014,
7,106 shares and 5,563 shares were issued on early exercise of options under the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan
by five individuals whose employment had terminated due to retirement (2013: 7,222 shares relating to three individuals whose
employment terminated due to retirement) and four whose employment had terminated due to redundancy, respectively.
Additionally during 2014 2,541 shares were issues on early exercise of options under the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan to one
individual whose employment had terminated due to retirement.

###### 26 Share-based payments


We operate two share option schemes for our employees – the Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) for directors and senior
executives, and the Savings-Related Share Option (“SAYE”) Plan for all qualifying employees. We incur a cost in respect of these
schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of
options outstanding.


Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant
vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.

Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”)

The BMP was introduced in 2009. Under the scheme, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made at £nil
consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus. A proportion
of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Group’s TSR matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance
with the scheme rules) over three years. For awards made from 2011, a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon
performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The fair value of the 2014, 2013 and 2012 BMP awards of
£5.4 million, £6.1 million and £5.8 million, respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the corresponding three year vesting periods.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE”)

In April 2014, participation in the SAYE Plan was offered again, to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees
to acquire shares at a price of 530 pence (2013: 493 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price
determined in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five year savings contracts.
The fair value of the options granted in connection with the SAYE Plan of £1.5 million (2013: £0.8 million) is being charged to the
income statement over the life of the relevant contracts.

The fair value of share-based payment awards was determined as follows:

SIP – based on price paid at award dates;

BMP – Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting; and

SAYE – Black-Scholes model which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.

The share premium and the merger reserve arose on the financial restructuring of the Group which took place in 2005.


Movements in share premium during 2014 reflect amounts received from the issue of shares under the Group’s employee

###### 28 Hedge reserve


Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to
the extent that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are
released as the related contracts mature, and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.

Managing our principal risks and uncertainties… As described in note 20, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the
purpose of commercial hedging; however not all of these contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The changes in
fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS effective hedge are recognised in the income statement.
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving prices and securing market level
dark green and bark spreads for the future.


The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow
hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along
with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents
whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged
items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to
the extent they are effective.

exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each
period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge
reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales

###### 33 Retirement benefit obligations


We operate a defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The Drax Power Group section of the Electricity
Supply Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme; a pension arrangement under which participating members receive
a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically entitled to annual pensions on
retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.

The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, by contrast provides a retirement benefit that is
dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the scheme.


The income statement charge for the defined benefit scheme is twofold – the current/past service cost is the increase in the
overall liability to pay benefits earned by current employees of the Group in the current/previous periods, the net interest cost
reflects the unwinding of the pension deficit over time, offset by income earned by the scheme’s assets.

The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group
in respect of the current period.


Defined contribution scheme

The Group operates two defined contribution schemes, The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan and Haven Power Personal Pension
Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows:


Years ended 31 December

2014 2013
£m £m


Total included in staff costs (note 32) 4.9 3.9


As at 31 December 2014, contributions of £0.4 million (2013: £0.7 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had
not been paid over to the scheme. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.

Defined benefit scheme


The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme on behalf of the Drax Power Group (“DPG”) section of the Electricity
Supply Pension Scheme (“ESPS”). This scheme was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through
being existing members of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits
as part of the scheme.

The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:


Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields;
if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion
of growth assets (equities, property and direct lending) which, though expected to outperform
corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth
assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.

Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities,
although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.


Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.

Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s benefit obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such
higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either
unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning an increase in inflation will also
increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place, to protect against
extreme inflation.


Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the government increasing
the burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as a higher proportion of
members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees insure certain benefits payable on death
before retirement.

A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension. See note 35 for details.

###### 33. Retirement benefit obligations (continued)

The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, as a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March
2013. Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years, therefore the next valuation will take place
on or before 31 March 2016.

The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted to 31 December 2014, taking into account
experience over the period since 31 March 2013, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic
assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost were measured using
the projected unit credit method. The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities,
are as follows:

As at 31 December

2014 2013
% p.a. % p.a.

Discount rate 3.7 4.5

Inflation (RPI) 3.0 3.4

Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.8 3.2

Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.6 4.4

The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member who retired in 2014 at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years (2013: 27 years) after
retirement if they are male and for a further 29 years (2013: 29 years) after retirement if they are female. Similarly life expectancy at
age 60 for male and female non-pensioners (currently aged 45) is assumed to be 28 years and 31 years respectively (2013: 28 years
and 31 years respectively).

The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair
value of the plan assets, determined as follows:

As at 31 December

2014 2013

Defined benefit obligation 242.1 220.9

by actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions and scheme experience of £0.5 million and £1.6 million
respectively (2013: losses of £4.6 million and gains of £8.5 million respectively).

The fair values of the major categories of plan assets were as follows:

As at 31 December

2014 2013
£m £m

Equities[(1)] 77.8 74.8

Fixed interest bonds[(2)] 100.5 71.2

Property 25.9 15.9

Hedge funds 0.4 17.2

Cash and other assets[(3)] 3.2 0.1

Fair value of total plan assets 207.8 179.2

(1) Under the Group’s long-term asset strategy, 60% of assets are invested in ‘return generating’ asset classes – of which 5% is invested in emerging market equity.
The remaining 40% of assets are invested in ‘liability-matching’ asset classes.

(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, government and absolute return bonds. Less than 1% has a sub-investment grade credit rating
(i.e. BB+ or lower).
(3) Other assets include £2.9 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market.

The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely
accepted capital market principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected
return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme.

The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have
a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit. The following table provides an indication of the
sensitivity of the pension deficit at 31 December 2014 to changes in these assumptions:

(Decrease)/Increase in net liability
% £m

Discount rate – Increase 0.25 (11.1)

– Decrease 0.25 12.0

Inflation rate[(1)] – Increase 0.25 10.0

– Decrease 0.25 (9.6)

Life expectancy – Increase 1 6.7

– Decrease 1 (6.8)

(1)  The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation. The impact of corresponding decreases in these
variables is included here.

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional
contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected
investment income.

The history of experience adjustments is as follows:

As at 31 December

###### 33. Retirement benefit obligations (continued)


The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (70%), former employees of the Group
who are yet to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (25%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected
to be made, or the duration of the liabilities, is currently 22 years.

The Group expects to contribute £11.2 million to its pension plans during the 12 months ended 31 December 2015.


The Group intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the last triennial valuation, over the period to 31 December 2019.

###### 34 Capital and other financial commitments


We have a number of financial commitments (i.e. a certain, contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that
are not recorded within our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for
the future purchase of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and
contracts for the provision of services.

Delivering our biomass strategy… We have made good progress towards securing near-term volumes of sustainable wood
pellets and continue with negotiations for long-term supplies and to support our third unit conversion, which is reflected in the
level of future commitments to purchase fuel, set out below.

###### 35 Contingent liabilities


Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control;
timing of the payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely.


Guaranteed Minimum Pension (“GMP”)

The UK government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for
males. This would correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group (note 33). At present, the
methodology for implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no
allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated
financial statements.

board of directors on 8 June 2016 and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on
those accounts was unqualified, did not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph and did not contain any
statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.

These interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended 31 December 2016 have
been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.
This standard stipulates that interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the
information required for the preparation of annual consolidated financial statements. The statutory accounts
delivered to the Registrar of Companies were prepared under FRS 102, the Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling (£) and rounded to the nearest
£’000.

The directors have reviewed the financial position of the Group and cash flow forecasts for at least 12 months
from the date of approval of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements and are satisfied that the
going concern assumption remains appropriate.

###### 1.3 Basis of consolidation

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements present the results of the Group and its own subsidiaries
(“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group
companies are therefore eliminated in full.

###### 2 Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for
sales and expenses during the nine month period.

In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made by
management in applying the group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the
same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016.

###### 3 Seasonality of operations

Due to the inherent seasonality related to the supply of energy and energy related services, higher revenues and
operating profits are usually expected through the winter period as seasonal weather patterns increase
end-customer demand.

###### 4 Employee loans

In March 2016, the Group made loans with a term of 32 years available to senior management employees which
the employees used to purchase shares of the Company pursuant to the exercise of share options. The employees
are required to apply a proportion of any dividend receipts or share sale proceeds to the early repayment of loans.
The loans incurred interest at rates ranging between 1.5% and 3.0% during the nine months ended 31 December
2016. In addition, the Group provided a loan pursuant to the loan agreements to the following directors:

**L Boland**
**£’000**

Balance as at 1 April 2016 551
Principal —
Net repayments —
Interest 15

Balance as at 31 December 2016 566

###### 5 Dividends

A dividend of £25,371k (2015: £27,369k) relating to the year ended 31 March 2016 was paid on the 4 April
2016.

###### 6 Current taxation

There is no material difference between the best estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate
expected for the full financial year and the average annual income tax rate used for the year to 31 March 2016.

###### 7 Asset held for sale

The Group has committed to the disposal of a parcel of freehold land it no longer utilises in the next 12 months.
The asset is available for immediate sale and a search is underway for a buyer. No impairment loss was
recognised on reclassification of the land as held for sale as at 31 December 2016 as the directors of the Group
expect that the fair value (estimated based on current prices of similar locations) less costs to sell is higher than
the carrying amount.

###### 8 Tangible fixed assets

There were no significant acquisitions or disposals of tangible fixed assets during the nine months to
31 December 2016.

See note 13 for commitments to purchase tangible fixed assets.

###### 9 Financial instruments

The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities are equivalent to their carrying amount.

In June 2016, a director exercised options over 15,625 Ordinary A shares of £0.01 in the Company at a strike
price of £15 per share. The difference between the nominal value of the shares issued, being £156, and the total
value of £250k has been credited to the share premium account.

On the same day, Telecom Plus PLC invoked its anti-dilution rights and purchased 6,250 Ordinary B shares for a
total cost of £55k. Engie Retail Investment UK Limited also invoked its anti-dilution rights and purchased 9,375
Ordinary A shares for a total cost of £124k.

Limited, held 575,140 ‘A’ shares in the Company (2015: 563,845). Engie Retail Investment UK Limited held no
further anti-dilution rights entitling it to acquire ‘A’ ordinary shares upton the exercise of employee share options
(2015: 11,295).

During the nine months to 31 December 2016, the Group incurred costs of £131,970k (2015: £136,791k) in
relation to the supply of power and gas from IPM Energy Trading Limited (“IPM”). All debts had been settled by
the reporting date.

At 31 December 2016, the Group had commitments to purchase £261,993k of power and gas from IPM over the
period to March 2020 (2015: £224,043k).

At 31 December 2016, Telecom Plus PLC held 390,327 Ordinary B Shares in Opus Energy Group Limited
(2015: 377,497). Telecom Plus PLC held no further anti-dilution rights entitling it to acquire Ordinary B shares
upon the exercise of employee options (2015: 6,250).

During the nine months to 31 December 2016, the Group recognised £703k of revenue from Telecom Plus PLC
(2015: 703k). £157k payable by Telecom Plus PLC was included in the Group’s trade debtors at the period end
(2015: £157k).

See note 4 for information regarding employee loans.

###### 13 Post balance sheet events

###### 1. Introduction

These non-statutory consolidated financial statements of Opus Energy Group Limited (the ‘Company’), which
include the Company together with the entities controlled by the Company (collectively, the ‘Group’), for the
three years ended 31 March 2016 has been prepared by the Directors (see Directors’ responsibility statement
below) in accordance with the basis of preparation as set out below.

###### 1.1 Directors’ responsibility statement

The directors of Opus Energy Group Limited (the ‘Directors’) have accepted responsibility for the preparation of
these non-statutory accounts for the years ended 31 March 2014, 31 March 2015, and 31 March 2016 which are
intended by them to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for
that period. They have decided to prepare the non-statutory accounts in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and as if applicable UK law applied to them.

In preparing these non-statutory accounts, the Directors have:

 - selected suitable accounting policies and applied them consistently;

- made judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

- prepared the non-statutory accounts on the going concern basis as they believe that the company will continue
in business.

The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the
assets of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

###### 1.2 Basis of preparation

These non-statutory consolidated financial statements have been prepared to present consolidated IFRS financial
statements for the years ended 31 March 2014, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016 for the first time to
shareholders. The non-statutory have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (Adopted IFRS) and in accordance with the Companies Act
2006, as if those requirements were to apply.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods
presented in these non-statutory consolidated financial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance
sheet at 1 April 2013 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRS (see note 27).

The financial information presented within this document does not comprise the statutory accounts of the Group
for the financial years 31 March 2014, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016. The consolidated statutory accounts
for those years were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and have been reported on by the Company’s
auditor and delivered to the registrar of companies. The reports of the auditor were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not
include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying
their report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.

###### 1.3 Transition to Adopted IFRS

The Company is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRS for the first time and
consequently has applied IFRS 1. An explanation of how the transition to Adopted IFRSs has affected the
reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company is provided in note 27.

The non-statutory accounts have therefore been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European
Union and therefore the non-statutory accounts comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.

The non-statutory accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis.

The financial statements are presented in Sterling (£) and rounded to the nearest £0.1 million, or where required,
the nearest £’000.

###### 1.4 Going concern

The Directors have reviewed the financial position of the Group and cash flow forecasts for at least 12 months
from the date of approval of these accounts and are satisfied that the going concern assumption remains
appropriate.

###### 1.5 Basis of consolidation

The non-statutory accounts incorporate the financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. The Company owns 100% of the equity of all
subsidiaries.

The impact of all intra-Group transactions is eliminated on consolidation.

###### 1.5 Accounting policies

Those accounting policies that are material to the non-statutory accounts are set out in the relevant note.

In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 April 2013, the Company has adjusted amounts reported
previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old basis of accounting (UK GAAP). An
explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to Adopted IFRSs has affected the Company’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in note 27 below.

A listing of new IFRS standards, interpretations and pronouncements which are in issue but not yet effective are
presented in note 25. The impact of these new requirements has yet to be assessed.

**_Judgements, estimates and uncertainties_**

The preparation of the non-statutory accounts requires management to exercise judgement in applying the
Group’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revision recognised in the period
in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the
related notes.

**_Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions_**

The judgements that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that differs from the amount recognised in the
non-statutory accounts are as follows:

**_Revenue and cost of sales_**

Revenue derived from the supply of energy includes an estimate of the value of energy supplied to customers
between the date of the last meter reading and the end of the reporting period. Estimates of the number of units
consumed but not yet processed through the settlement process are based on an estimate of the expected annual
consumption for that customer to the period end until final reconciliation data is received.

Similarly, purchase volumes are also subject to the same degree of estimation, with associated settlement costs
dependant on the receipt of final reconciliation data from the relevant industry body.

**_Financial instruments_**

The Group has long term commercial agreements for the supply of electricity and gas. On the grounds that these
contracts are held for the purpose of the delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the Group’s expected
purchase and sale requirements, net settlement of the contracts through the exchange of cash or another financial
instruments is not permitted, and the Group has no prior history of settling similar contracts in this way, the own
use exemption has been applied.

7

F-166


-----

**_Impairment of trade debtors_**

Trade debtors are stated net of the allowance for the impairment of bad and doubtful debts. The allowance is
calculated by applying historical collection rates to balances outstanding as at the year-end date, with the amount
of any loss recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income under administrative expenses.

**_Accounting for Renewables Obligation_**

Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) are green certificates used by suppliers to demonstrate that they have
met their obligation to source a certain proportion of the electricity they supply from renewable sources.

The carrying amount of ROCs in the Group’s balance sheet is dependent upon its purpose.

ROCs that are purchased for the purpose of being utilised in the settlement of the Group’s own renewable
obligation are held at cost and are classified under prepayments.

The Group’s own renewable obligation is based upon the expected realisable value of a ROC. This assessment is
based on an estimated future sales price.

**_Share-based payments_**

The fair value of shares and options granted is obtained using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Assumptions include expected volatility, expected life, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield.

###### 2 Revenue

All revenue arose from the Group’s principal activity and within the United Kingdom.

Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from the sale of actual and
estimated electricity and gas supplied during the year, net of discounts and value added taxes, and to a lesser
extent, revenue from services provided to other companies associated with the supply of electricity and gas.

Revenue includes the directors’ best estimate of differences between estimated sales and billed sales. All actual
metered consumption data related to customers’ electricity and gas consumption received by the end of the year
has been reflected in revenue. Actual metered consumption data relating to the year but received after the year
end is not reflected in revenue.

Revenue is recognised when the associated risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, to the extent
that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group and where the
turnover can be measured reliably. For electricity supply and gas supplied, revenue is recognised on
consumption.

###### 3 Segmental reporting

The Group has one reportable segment, being the supply of energy in the United Kingdom. The Board (as the
chief operating decision maker) undertakes regular reviews of the results of this segment.

###### 4 Operating expenses and EBITDA

This note sets out the material components of ‘Operating and administrative expenses’ in the Consolidated
Income Statement, and a detailed breakdown of the fees paid to the Group’s auditor, KPMG LLP, in respect of
the services they have provided to the Group over the three years.

###### 6 Current and deferred taxation

The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount payable on this year’s
taxable profits (which are adjusted for items upon which the Group is not required to pay tax or, in some cases,
for items which are not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which the Group is required to pay additional
tax). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the
future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules (reflected in differences between carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
profits). The tax charge reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for each of the
years covered in these non-statutory accounts, including the movement in the deferred tax balance in each year,
so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.

**Accounting policy**

Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it
excludes items, income or expense that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible.
The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of
taxable profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or
the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date.

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective
from 1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Further reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April
2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. An additional
reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was announced in the Budget on 16 March 2016.

In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and
expenditure for tax purposes. The Group believes that the assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience
and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the
period-end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is
considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.

###### 7 Earnings per share

Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profits) that are attributable to each
ordinary share in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year.

There is no material difference between the weighted average number of ordinary shares used for the purpose of
both basic and diluted earnings per share.

Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

###### 9 Retained profits

Retained profits are a component of equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits generated over
the lifetime of the Group, reduced by the amount of that profit distributed back to shareholders. The table below
reconciles the movements in retained profits during the year.

**Years ended 31 March**

**At 31 March** **35.8** **37.7** **29.6**

**Distributable profits**

The capacity of the Company to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained
distributable profits and cash resources.

The immediate cash resources of the Group are set out in note 14 and the recent history of cash generation in note 15.

The majority of these cash resources are held by the principal operating subsidiaries of the Group, in particular
Opus Energy Limited.

###### 10 Non-current assets held for sale

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use, they are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly
probable within one year.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell.

-----

The Group has committed to the disposal of a parcel of freehold land it no longer utilises in the 12 months from
31 March 2016. The asset is available for immediate sale and a search is underway for a buyer. No impairment
loss was recognised on reclassification of the land as held for sale as at 31 March 2016 as the directors of the
Group expect that the fair value (estimated based on current prices in similar locations) less costs to sell is higher
than the carrying amount.

###### 11 Property, plant and equipment

**Property, plant and equipment**

This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by the Group to
generate revenue.

**Accounting policy**

Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost is comprised of the purchase price and directly
attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in
the manner intended by management. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.

Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the
estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition. The table below shows the range of useful lives
and the average useful life of an asset in the main categories of asset in years:

**UEL (range)**

_Plant and machinery_ 3-4

Freehold land, held at cost, is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.

The assets’ residual value, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if
appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the previous reporting date.

###### 12 Trade and other receivables

Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers for goods or services provided but not yet been paid for.
Other receivables include accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in
respect of power delivered that will be invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid
by the Group for which it is yet to either receive or utilise the relevant goods or services in return.

Prepayments primarily consist of contract costs and ROCs.

Contract costs are commissions payable to third parties in respect of obtaining customer contracts. Contract costs
are amortised over the life of the contract.

ROCs are purchased for the purpose of being utilised in the settlement of the Group’s own Renewable Obligation
and are held at cost (as described in note 13). As the ROCs are not being held for future resale, they are not
classified as inventory. As at 31 March 2016, the Group held £12.5m (2015: £11.9m) (2014: £5.3m) of prepaid
ROCs.

**Accounting policy**

Trade and other receivables that have no stated interest rate and are due to be settled within one year are
measured at the undiscounted amount of consideration expected to be received, net of impairment.

Trade and other receivables that have a stated interest rate are initially measured at the transaction price.
Subsequently, such instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

**Years ended 31 March**

**2016** **2015** **2014**

Amounts falling due within one year:
Trade receivables **52.3** 47.7 32.8

Prepayments and other receivables **40.4** 30.2 16.9
**137.9** **116.5** **81.4**

Trade receivables principally represent amounts outstanding from sales generated through the Group’s principal
activity, to both Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and corporate customers.

Of total trade receivables at 31 March 2016, £35 million (2015: £33 million) (2014: £24 million) relates to SME
sales. The risk profile associated with debt due from corporate and SME customers is different, limiting the
likelihood of concentrations of credit risk. All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk
policies for indicators of impairment

Trade receivables include amounts that are past due at the end of the reporting period for which the Group has
not recognised a provision for doubtful debts as follows:

All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk policies for indicators of impairment and
provisions made where appropriate. Credit risk is discussed in further detail in note 20. Management does not
consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts.
The provision has been determined with reference to past default experiences and has moved over the course of
the historical period as follows:

###### 13 Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables represent amounts owed to suppliers (for goods and services provided), tax authorities
and other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business.

Accruals are made for amounts that will fall due for payment in the future as a result of current activities.
Accruals primarily consist of the Group’s Renewable Obligation, an industry support mechanism designed to
support large-scale renewable electricity generation by placing an obligation on all licensed electricity suppliers
to source a certain proportion of the electricity they supply from renewable energy sources. As at 31 March 2016,
the Group’s accrual for Renewable Obligation stood at £50.0m (2015: £37.3m) (2014: £24.6m).

**Accounting policy**

Trade and other payables that have no stated interest rate and are due to be settled within one year are initially
and subsequently measured at the undiscounted amount of consideration expected to be paid.

**Years ended 31 March**

**2016** **2015** **2014**

Other accruals and deferred income **76.1** 59.8 48.5
Other payables **25.4** 17.9 6.3
**120.0** **98.0** **68.4**

The Group has a £35m revolving credit facility which expires in June 2019. At 31 March 2016, the Group had
not drawn on the facility (2015: nil) (2014: nil). Interest on borrowings under this facility is payable at a fixed
margin over LIBOR.

The facility is secured by a fixed and floating charge over all assets of Opus Energy Group Limited granted in
favour of Barclays Bank plc as agent. The Group has a £10m overdraft facility with similar terms and security.

A secondary fixed and floating charge over all assets of Opus Energy Group Limited has been granted in favour
of IPM Energy Trading Limited.

###### 16 Equity and reserves

**Accounting policy**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Group after
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

###### 18 Share-based payments

Share-based payment arrangements in which the Company receives goods or services as consideration for its
own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how
the equity instruments are obtained by the Company. The grant date fair value of share-based payments awards
granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the
period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.

Share options have been granted under two unapproved schemes, one set up in 2006 and the other in March
2012. The rules of both schemes are substantially the same. Under the 2006 scheme, all options vest on a time
basis with no performance conditions attached. The general rule of the 2006 scheme is that options vest over the
three years after the date of grant and expire 10 years after the date of grant. For the 2012 scheme the options
vest immediately. The exercise price is payable in cash. Vested options may only be exercised upon a sale of the
Company, a public listing of the Company’s shares or approval by the board of directors of the Company (except
for the options held by F Esiri which are exercisable at any time). During the year 1,475 share options were
granted under the 2012 scheme (2015: 10,275 share options were granted under the 2012 scheme and a further
1,000 share options were issued under the 2006 scheme) (2014: 10,850 share options were granted under the
2012 scheme).

The estimated fair value of each share option granted has been calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model at the date of grant. The model is internationally recognised as being appropriate to value employee share
schemes similar to both the 2006 and 2012 schemes. The period between the grant date and assumed exercise
date (i.e. the period over which the fair value is charged to the profit and loss account) is three years.

The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options are as follows:


**Weighted** **Weighted** **Weighted**
**average** **average** **average**
**exercise** **exercise** **exercise**

At the end of 2016, 15,625 options were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of £15 (2015: 15,625 at
a weighted average exercise price of £15) (2014: 46,875 at a weighted average exercise price of £15).

The options outstanding at 31 March 2016, of which 36,375 were issued under the 2006 scheme, and 41,000
were issued under the 2012 scheme, have exercise prices in the range of £15 to £90 (2015: £15 to £90) (2014:
£15 to £75) and had a weighted average contractual life remaining of 4.8 years (2015: 5.6 years) (2014:
5.2 years).

###### 19 Pension commitments

The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The pension charge for the year represented
contributions payable by the Group and amounted to £0.5m (2015: £0.5m) (2014: £0.2m).

Contributions which amounted to £110k at 31 March 2016 (2015: £91k) (2014: £37k) were payable to the
scheme and included in creditors.

###### 20 Risk management disclosures

The material financial risks to which the Group is exposed are considered to be commodity price risk and credit
risk.

**Commodity price risk**

The Group is exposed to the effects of volatility in its costs of supply.

The Group devotes considerable management resources and develops systems and models designed to hedge
price risk and match as closely as possible the quantities of electricity and gas which it buys at a fixed price with
its commitments to supply to customers at a fixed price. However, in volatile wholesale electricity and gas
commodity markets, it is not always possible to match these prices and volumes; variables include the weather
and end-customer demand. In addition to the rigorous modelling of the demand of its portfolio of customers,
which is continually updated, the Group seeks to protect itself through its contractual terms with its customers
and through maintenance of a pricing policy which ensures sufficient margin for such inevitable forecasting
errors.

Of the Group’s financial instruments, only contracts under the long-term commercial agreements for the supply
of electricity and gas are exposed to commodity price risk. The Group applies the Own Use exemption to its
energy contracts, meaning that contracts for the future supply of energy in the normal course of business are
recognised in the Group’s financial statements as and when supply is made. As such, the Group is not exposed to
commodity price risk as defined by IFRS 7.

**Credit risk**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance
sheet date.

**Financial assets:**

Trade and other receivables **140.9** 119.7 83.7
**163.2** **144.7** **104.8**

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £3.0 million
(2015: £3.2 million) (2014: £2.3 million).

Bad debts associated with failure of customers to pay their energy bills represent one of the largest administrative
expenses of the business. Late payment of customer bills also imposes increased working capital requirements on
the Group. The Group actively monitors the credit of its customers, varies its pricing to accommodate customer
credit risk profile, manages its customer portfolio to mitigate credit concentration and devotes significant
resources to managing its receivables book, including the development and continuous improvement of IT
systems to minimise billing inaccuracies which can lead to late payments.

###### 21 Other financial instruments

The Group holds a variety of non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and trade
payables and receivables arising from its operations.

**Accounting policy**

Cash and cash equivalents (note 14), trade and other receivables (note 12) and trade and other payables (note 13)
generally have short times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values, on the amortised cost basis,
approximate to their fair value.

buildings and motor vehicles, contracts for the future purchase of Renewable Obligation Certificates and

The Group has adopted IFRS for the first time in the preparation of these non-statutory accounts. In preparing the
non-statutory accounts, an opening balance sheet has been prepared as at 1 April 2013, the Group’s date of
transition to IFRS. Subsequent reconciliations between the financial statements previously reported based on
UK GAAP and those prepared based on IFRS have been prepared to show how the transition affected the
Group’s reported financial performance and financial position. The transition to IFRS had no effect on the
Group’s previously reported cash flow.

**Transition adjustments:**

**1 Credit balances**

On transition to IFRS, the Group changed its policy regarding credit balances. Previously, credit balances were
recognised in the income statement based on historical collection rates and deducted from the Group’s liability
for credit balances. As of 1 April 2013, credit balances will only be recognised once they have reached their
statutory time limit of six years. This has resulted in the Group making an adjustment on transition of
£5.4 million in relation to credit balances previously recognised prior to their statutory time limit. In subsequent
years, the Group recognised an adjustment in relation to credit balances of £1.4m in the year to 31 March 2014,
£1.5m in the year to 31 March 2015 and £2.9m in the year to 31 March 2016.

**2 Annual leave accrual**

IFRS requires short-term employee benefits to be charged to the income statement as the employee service is
received. This has resulted in the Group recognising a liability on transition to IFRS in relation to employees who
have earned but not taken the entitlement to annual leave as at 1 April 2013. The accrual has been measured at
£0.2 million. Previously, annual leave accruals were not recognised and were charged to the income statement as
they were paid.

**3 Assets held for sale**

IFRS requires assets to be classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and the sale is
highly probable within one year. There was no equivalent requirement under UK GAAP. Non-current assets
classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Further information is disclosed in note 10.
