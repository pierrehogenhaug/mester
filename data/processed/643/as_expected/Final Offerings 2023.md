-----

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities offered under this Offering
Memorandum will be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act
pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that this Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person
into whose possession this Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver this Offering
Memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers (as defined in this attached Offering
Memorandum) or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the
offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such
jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall this Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation
of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation
or sale would be unlawful.

This Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently neither the initial purchasers set forth in the attached Offering Memorandum (collectively, the
“Initial Purchasers”) nor any person who controls it nor any director, officer, employee nor agent of it or affiliate
of any such person accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the
Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version available to you on
request from the Initial Purchasers. If you receive this document by e-mail, you should not reply by e-mail to this
announcement. Any reply e-mail communications, including those you generated by using the “reply” function
on your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive this document by e-mail, your use of this email is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions to ensure that it is free from viruses and
other items of a destructive nature.

Any securities to be issued will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the expiration of a 40-day distribution compliance period (as defined under Regulation S under the
Securities Act) commencing on the issue date, the securities may not be offered or sold in the United States, except
pursuant to another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in a member state of the EEA. For the purposes of this paragraph,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of Directive 2014/65 (as amended, “MiFID II”); (b) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a “professional client” as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (c) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the
EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparty only target market: Solely**
for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in the EEA in
respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market
for the Notes is professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. A distributor should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.


-----

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this paragraph, a “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (b) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (c) not
a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “U.K. Prospectus Regulation”), and the expression an offer includes the communication in any form
and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable
an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom
may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the United Kingdom will
be made pursuant to an exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus
Regulation.

**U.K. product governance / professional client and eligible counterparty only target market: Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in the United Kingdom
in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market
for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Handbook
of Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor” should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

The attached Offering Memorandum has not been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of FSMA by an
authorized person under FSMA. In the United Kingdom, the attached Offering Memorandum and any other
material in relation to the Notes described therein are being distributed only to, and are directed only at, persons
who are not “retail investors” (as defined above) and who are (i) persons having professional experience in matters
relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Order”), and persons falling within Article 49 of the Order, or (ii)
persons to whom it would otherwise be lawful to distribute them, all such persons together being referred to as
“Relevant Persons.” The Notes are only available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase
or otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in only with, Relevant Persons. The attached Offering
Memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed, published or reproduced (in whole
or in part) or disclosed by any recipients to any other person in the United Kingdom who is not a Relevant Person.
Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on the attached Offering
Memorandum or its contents.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment
activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the
Notes other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Company (as defined
herein).

**Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A.**

**€250,000,000** **Floating Rate Notes due 2028**
**€420,000,000** **8.75% Fixed Rate Notes due 2028**

Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A., a public limited liability company (société anonyme) incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg (the “Issuer”),
is offering €250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2028 (the “Floating Rate Notes”) and €420,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of its 8.75% Fixed Rate Notes due 2028 (the “Fixed Rate Notes” and, together with the Floating Rate Notes, the “Notes”). The Issuer is an entity
beneficially owned principally by Permira Funds (as defined herein).
The Floating Rate Notes will mature on May 1, 2028. The Issuer will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes at a per annum rate equal to three-month
EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor) plus 5.25% per year, reset quarterly. Interest will be paid on the Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears on March 15,
June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2023. The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on May 1, 2028. The Issuer
will pay interest on the Fixed Rate Notes semi-annually on each June 15 and December 15, commencing December 15, 2023.
The Issuer may redeem the Notes at the times and at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the relevant series
of Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a
change of control will not be deemed to have occurred on one occation if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded as a result of such
event. In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the relevant series of Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax
law.
The Notes will be the Issuer’s general, senior obligations and will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of the Issuer
that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement (as defined
herein), certain cash management obligations, if any, and certain hedging obligations, if any, and rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, if any. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Notes
**Guarantees” and each, a “Notes Guarantee”) (i) on or about the Issue Date, by CABB Group GmbH and (ii) within 120 days of the Issue Date, by the**
Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined herein) (each a “Guarantor” and together, the “Guarantors”). The Notes Guarantee issued by each Guarantor will rank
_pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such_
Notes Guarantee (including indebtedness incurred under the New Revolving Credit Facilities, certain cash management obligations, if any, and certain
hedging obligations, if any) and rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in
right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, if any.
On or about the Issue Date, each series of the Notes will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral (as defined herein). Within 120 days of the Issue Date,
subject to agreed security principles, the Notes will also be secured by the Post-Issue Date Collateral (as defined herein). Under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined herein), in the event of enforcement of the security interests, holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only after
amounts owing under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement have been repaid in full. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The
_Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests_
and the liability of the Guarantors will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
_and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

There is currently no public market for the Notes. We will apply to have the Notes listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(the “LuxSE”), without admission to trading on one of the securities markets operated by LuxSE. There is no assurance that the Notes will be, or will
remain, listed on the Securities Official List of the LuxSE.

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 25.**

**Price for the Floating Rate Notes: 97.5% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**

**Price for the Fixed Rate Notes: 100.0% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**

We expect that the Notes will be delivered in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A.
(“Clearstream”) on or about April 28, 2023 (the “Issue Date”).

**The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S.**
**Securities Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional**
**buyers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and in offshore**
**transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). You are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be**
**relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. See “Notice to Prospective U.S.**

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in a member state in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means
a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive (EU)
2014/65 (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended,
the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering,
selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer
of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus
for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and eligible counterparty only target market: Solely**
for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). For these purposes, a “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and
any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the
“U.K. Prospectus Regulation”), and the expression an offer includes the communication in any form and by any
means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to
decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K.
may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the U.K. will be made
pursuant to an exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers
of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

**U.K. product governance / professional client and eligible counterparty only target market: Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in the United Kingdom
in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market
for the Notes is only eligible counterparties as defined in the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Handbook
Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

regulatory changes in the markets in which we operate or intend to operate. In some cases, you can identify

“estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “projected,”
“should,” or “will” or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors

you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous
assumptions and that our actual results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the
development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those
made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition,
even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering

of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all
such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry and Market Data” and_
“Our Business” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the
markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events
described in this Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all. Accordingly, prospective investors
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which

information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These
forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press releases (including on our website),

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information of the Group**

The Issuer is a holding company and is not expected to engage in any activities other than those related to the
Transactions. The Issuer’s only material assets and liabilities are currently, and are expected in the future to be,
its interests in the issued and outstanding shares of its subsidiaries, its outstanding indebtedness and inter-company
balances incurred in connection with the Transactions described in the Offering Memorandum.

All historical financial information of the Group included in this Offering Memorandum is that of Monitchem
Holdco 2 S.A. (the direct holding company of the Issuer) and its consolidated subsidiaries. Monitchem Holdco 2
S.A. is not a member of the restricted group subject to the covenants under the Indenture (which will comprise
the Issuer and the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries (collectively, the “Restricted Group”)) and will not guarantee
the Notes. On a _pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds_
therefrom, the only material assets of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. will be its equity ownership in the Issuer.

This Offering Memorandum includes and presents:

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 and the notes thereto, which have been audited by KPMG Audit S.à r.l. (formerly KPMG
Luxembourg, Société cooperative) (“KPMG Luxembourg”), with comparable information for the year
ended December 31, 2021 (“2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”);

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021, and the notes thereto, which have been audited by KPMG Luxembourg, with comparable
information for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”);
and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020, and the notes thereto, which have been audited by KPMG Luxembourg, with comparable
information for the year ended December 31, 2019 (“2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”).

The 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and
the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements are together referred to as the “Audited Consolidated
**Financial Statements.” Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this Offering**
Memorandum has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by
the European Union (“IFRS”).

Our consolidated financial statements are presented in euro.

**Adoption of new accounting standards**

With effect from January 1, 2022, we applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations published
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union. The amendments
had no material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations:

- Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37 Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020. The
amendments to IFRS include an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards.
Furthermore, an additional provision was added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer must apply the provisions
from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when identifying assumed liabilities within
the scope of these standards.

- The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items produced
while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognized with the associated
costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not permissible.

- The amendments to IAS 37 specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a
contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments apply for annual
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 to contracts existing at the date when the amendments
are first applied. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments is

i


-----

recognized as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity, as
appropriate. The comparatives are not restated.

- The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments,
whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and vice versa are to be
included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities. Costs or fees paid to other
third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 41 Agriculture, and to the explanatory
examples of IFRS 16 Leases.

**Segmental Reporting Change**

In 2021, the Group’s business was reorganized into a new corporate structure, which transferred the two former
business units “Custom Manufacturing” and “Acetyls” into a fully integrated organization, “One CABB.” As a
result, the Group no longer reports segment information relating to the two former business units “Custom
Manufacturing” and “Acetyls” and therefore, the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and
2022 are not directly comparable against the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-IFRS measures and ratios, including Reported EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Group Net Working Capital, Operating Net Working Capital, Capital
Expenditure, Total Net Financial Debt, Cash Generation and Cash Conversion that are not required by, or
presented in accordance with, IFRS. Our non-IFRS measures are defined by us as follows:

We define “Reported EBITDA” as net result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial results,
amortization and depreciation.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial result,
amortization and depreciation and adjustments for expenses and income not related to the operational performance
of the business activities, such as strategic projects, restructuring and reorganization measures, financial impacts
of natural disasters, property damage insurance compensations, as well as valuation impacts resulting from
curtailments or modifications to pension or post-retirement benefits schemes and purchase price allocations.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

We define “Group Net Working Capital” as inventories plus accounts receivable, trade plus contract assets plus
other non-financial receivables plus income tax receivables minus accounts payable, trade minus contract
liabilities minus income tax liabilities minus other non-financial liabilities.

We define “Operating Net Working Capital” as Group Net Working Capital minus purchase price allocation
(“PPA”) valuation on inventory plus net working capital of holding entities plus net income tax receivables.

We define “Capital Expenditure” acquisition of intangible assets plus acquisition of property, plant and
equipment as stated in the cash flow statement. Total Capital Expenditure includes paid capital expenditures only.

We define “Total Net Financial Debt” as the aggregate principal amount of notes, loans from non-controlling
interests, accrued interests, lease liabilities, the negative fair value of interest rate swap agreements and utilized
revolving credit facilities, less short-term cash deposits as well as cash and cash equivalents.

We define “Cash Generation” as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash flow from investing activities.

We define “Cash Conversion” as Cash Generation divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain
investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.
The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have

**Business Overview**

We are a leading CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) and fine chemistry manufacturer
with global operations, supplying customized ingredients to major players in the Western Crop Science market,
as well as high purity and high-complexity chemical ingredients to customers in the Life Science and Performance
Material markets. Our strong technology portfolio, technical know-how and execution capabilities allow us to
cover a wide spectrum of highly specialized customer needs, specifications and complexity profiles.

Headquartered in Germany, we operate a global network with six production facilities located in Pratteln
(Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland), Galena (Kansas, United States), Gersthofen (Germany), Knapsack (Germany)
and Jining, Shandong Province (China).

Our varied product portfolio is organized across two product groups: (i) Exclusives (tailor-made active ingredients
and precursors developed for individual customers on an exclusive basis (our CDMO offering)) and Specialties
(highly specialized ingredients with applications in high-margin end-markets) products and (ii) Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals products (intermediate and base chemical products such as high purity
monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), chloroacetyl chloride (“CAC1”) and caustic soda across a large purity spectrum
with multiple end-use applications).

Our products are deeply embedded into our customers’ value chains, often on a near-exclusive basis, allowing us
to be aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination and to set up scalable manufacturing facilities
and efficient commercial production processes. The combination of our production know-how, lengthy product
development processes and contractually agreed capital expenditure contributions for some of our products
typically result in high contract renewal rates and low customer churn.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of €755.5 million and an Adjusted
EBITDA of €162.6 million (21.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin). Between 2020 and 2022, our revenue grew at
23.9% CAGR, whereas our Adjusted EBITDA grew at 20.0% CAGR. Exclusives and Specialties contributed to
56.8% of our revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 whereas Advanced Intermediates and Base
Chemicals accounted for 43.2% of our revenue for the same period.

Our products are used for end-market applications mainly in: (i) Crop Science (e.g., herbicides, fungicides,
insecticides and other livestock and crop protection products), (ii) Life Science (e.g., pharma, personal care,
nutrition, fragrances and flavor applications) and (iii) Performance Materials (e.g., curatives in epoxies,
polyimides, polyesters and other resin systems used for electronic components, semiconductors and for
composites, fibers, films, and foams that provide heat and electrical resistance). These end-markets, in particular
Crop Science, have shown resilient historical growth rates and benefit from structural mega-trends that are
expected to drive further resilient growth in the near- to mid-term, such as increasing demand for food and need
for increased farming yields on the one hand, and an aging population and improving living standards on the other.
In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the
Crop Science market, approximately 20% in the Life Science market, approximately 15% in the Performance
Materials market and approximately 15% relate to others (e.g., base chemicals and industrial MCA) (measured as
a percentage of revenues).

Exclusives, our CDMO offering, provides tailor-made active ingredients and precursors tailored to individual
customer specifications in Crop Science and are a primary contributor to our overall profitability. Based on
customer-developed IP, these products require customized production lines, expansive know-how and close
cooperation with our customers. We offer development and manufacturing services for proprietary products on
an exclusive and confidential basis to leading players in the Crop Science market such as: BASF, Bayer, Corteva
and Syngenta, and we have relationships with nearly all major players in the Western Crop Science market.

-----

Our Specialties offering consists of specialty ingredients that leverage our considerable manufacturing expertise
to create complex chemical products that serve specific customer needs across a variety of applications in the
Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials industries. Unlike Exclusives, these products can be
offered to multiple customers at a time. Our offering highlights our excellent production capabilities and knowhow along with our ability to offer specialized technology process and development services which allows us to
continuously provide high-quality and purity products to our customers and which we believe is a key
differentiator in this field. Our Specialties products are also a strong contributor to profitability, leveraging our
close client relationship and high customer “stickiness”. In particular, we offer high value-add products for fastgrowing applications in Life Science (pharma and personal care as well as nutrition) and Performance Materials
markets (coatings, e.g., in electronics or other industrial applications), backed by several attractive long-term
customer contracts, which offer high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Customers for our
Specialties products include players such as Agilent Technologies, Bayer, Corteva, Deciem/Estee Lauder, DSM,
Evonik, Merck, Novartis and Syngenta.

In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, we offer intermediate and base chemical
products, such as MCA, CAC1 and caustic soda, that serve as chemical building blocks for other secondary
chemical processes with a variety of applications across a large number of industries and markets. We believe we
are one of the leading suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas and we operate state-of-the-art sites,
allowing us to provide a full range of purity and quality for our customers. Large parts of our Advanced
Intermediates supply agreements feature price formulas that allow us to partially pass on price increases in costs
of certain raw materials. Furthermore, we also generate a portion of our revenue from Base Chemicals and other
products such as caustic soda, that are generated as by-products from our Exclusives and Advanced Intermediates
production lines.

**Our Strengths**

**_Structurally growing end-markets and increasing outsourcing trends_**

Our underlying key end-markets (Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials) are enjoying strong and
resilient underlying growth, further supported by increasing outsourcing trends that are reinforcing demand for
our Crop Science CDMO offering.

In the financial year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated in the Crop
Science and Life Science markets (estimate based on internal company assessments), the majority of which
consists of our CDMO offering through our Exclusives products and to a smaller degree of contributions from
our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products. As a result, growth in the underlying Crop Science
and Life Science markets, specifically within CDMO products and novel advanced intermediates, represent key
growth levers for our business.

_Crop Science_

Our addressable CDMO Crop Science market grew by 9% to 10% CAGR between 2019 and 2022, outperforming
the underlying global market for Crop Science products which grew by approximately 8% CAGR during the same
period (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). Market research indicates continued growth until 2027 with
respect to both our addressable CDMO Crop Science market (4% to 5% CAGR from 2022 to 2027) and the
underlying global market for Crop Science products (2% CAGR) (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). For
more information on the specific historical and projected growth of the addressable CDMO Crop Science and
underlying global Crop Science markets, see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺General.”

The growth in the underlying global Crop Science market in particular is underpinned by the following megatrends (see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺Key Drivers” for a more detailed overview) (Roland
Berger Report, AgbioInvestor):

    - Growing population: global population growth drives demand for food and crops; and

    - Decreasing arable land: arable land per capita is decreasing, requiring efficient crop protection
products to increase farming yields.

These market dynamics are further supported by several specific trends in the addressable CDMO Crop Science
market, including (see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺Key Drivers” for a more detailed overview)
(Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor, Company Information):

2


-----

    - Growth in CDMO outsourcing: customers prioritizing research and development, sales and
marketing and digitalization activities and striving to reduce their capital intensity and costs (in 2022,
approximately 40% to 50% of active ingredient production by Crop Science Players was outsourced
to CDMOs);

    - Increasing complexity of active ingredient molecules: requires specialist CDMO partners with strong
technical expertise and assets fitting into global supply chains of Crop Science players; and

    - Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements: lead to higher demand for novel active ingredients,
often outsourced to CDMOs with highly efficient multi-purpose facilities.

Furthermore, historical demand for crop protection products has proven to be resilient to adverse events
maintaining a growth trend in spite of temporary downturns. For example, declines in average crop commodity
prices (e.g., corn, wheat, soybean) caused by events such as lower pest pressure and economic recessions in
production markets such as in Brazil, and North American weather conditions in 2019 led to a temporary downturn
in the crop protection market but were followed by year-on-year increases. Furthermore, while agrochemical
production was impacted by coronavirus-related restrictions in the first quarter of 2020, it swiftly normalized
following an easing of lockdown restrictions. While the coronavirus restrictions did impact labor availability both
in terms of production and field work, many countries deemed the agricultural sector to be of considerable
importance in maintaining food security, so restrictions on movement were less severe than in most industries
(Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

The addressable market for novel active ingredients (active ingredients introduced after 2010), a subset of the
CDMO Crop Science market, is anticipating significantly higher growth rates at a CAGR of approximately 13.7%
from 2021 to 2027, owing to, among other factors, a higher outsourcing rate due to production complexity (Roland
Berger Report). Against this background, we act as a key partner for our clients in this area, supporting innovators
with our technical expertise and state-of-the-art production facilities. Our Crop Science product portfolio benefits
from a modern set of active ingredients. We are not materially involved in the production of raw materials or
finished product for glyphosate or neonicotinoids.

_Life Science_

Our Specialty products benefit from the strong underlying growth rates in a number of attractive niche markets
for specialized Life Science applications. In 2022, the addressable Life Science market accounted for the second
largest portion of our revenue after the Crop Science market. Our products in this area consist primarily of
Advanced Intermediates products as well as Specialties products.

Our addressable Life Science markets grew between 2019 and 2022 and are expected to grow further, driven by
structural mega-trends including a global aging population and an increasing disposable income spent on personal
care, showing the strength of this segment for our future growth potential (Roland Berger Report, Company
Information). For more information on trends driving Life Sciences growth (including niche markets), see
“Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺Key Drivers.”

Individual addressable high growth sub-markets such as the oligonucleotide synthesis market (used for the
production of synthetic RNA and DNA templates) increased significantly in 2021 and 2022, and forecasts are
estimating future significant growth. See also “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺General⸺DCA.”
While this is in part due to the market’s limited current size, it also highlights how we may be able to leverage
our technical excellence to capitalize on developing demand for high-purity ingredients. For example, we are the
global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNAbased medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022).
Furthermore, DCA applications in the production of synthetic RNA and DNA templates have wider uses in the
Life Sciences industry than COVID-19 applications (where mostly enzymatic synthesis is employed), so our
product has only some commercial exposure to the trends driving COVID-19 vaccines and will benefit from
growing end markets due to both increased investments into research and development (e.g. improvement of
genomic technologies) as well as broader commercial use (e.g. “oligonucleotide therapeutics”), see “Industry and
_Market Data⸺Life Science⸺DCA⸺Key Drivers” (Roland Berger Report, Company Information)._

_Performance Materials_

Our Specialties products with niche applications benefit from attractive market dynamics in addressable endmarkets in the Performance Materials segment, BTDA, 6FDA and other markets, which are expected to grow

3


-----

until 2027 (Roland Berger Report). For more information on projected growth rates, see “Industry and Market
_Data⸺Performance Materials⸺Specialty Anhydrides⸺General and “Industry and Market Data⸺Performance_
_Materials⸺Electronic Performance Materials Product⸺General.”_

Our BTDA and 6FDA products are used for numerous applications in electronics, infrastructure and transportation
and benefit from favorable macro trends in these sectors, such as growth in smart devices, the switch to 5G
infrastructure and higher government and industry spending on infrastructure. Our electronic performance
materials product is primarily used in the semiconductor industry, which fundamentally benefits from (i) the
introduction of new generation semiconductors, (ii) increasing electrification (e.g., autonomous driving and digital
connectivity) and (iii) the rise of artificial intelligence enabled by semiconductors (Roland Berger Report).

**_Leading Crop Science CDMO and Differentiated Life Science Ingredients Player with Global Presence_**

We are a leading player in the Western Crop Science CDMO market, serving major global agrochemicals
companies and holding strategic supplier status with some of the largest European-based Crop Science companies
for their agrochemicals business. We are among the top two Western CDMO players in the Crop Science market
(by Crop Science CDMO revenue as of 2021). We have a strong focus on novel active ingredients, directly
competing with only a select number of other Tier 1 players that are able to serve this segment. We are wellpositioned within the top five players globally in the Crop Science market (measured by Crop Science CDMO
revenue as of 2021) due to strong customer relationships, diverse and unique asset footprint and technical knowhow (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

We also have a significant presence in the Life Science market, providing customized products in segments such
as novel RNA therapeutics, vitamins and supplements, and anti-aging and personal care and hold leading positions
in the markets for European MCA supply, high purity DCA, as well as CAE manufacturing and cosmetic grade
GA in Life Science: We are one of the largest European Life Science MCA suppliers (by production volume in
Europe as of 2022). We are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade
DCA (a key ingredient for RNA-based medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity
DCA revenue as of 2022) (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). In cosmetic grade GA, we are globally
the second largest supplier (measured by revenue as of 2022) and the only European producer with global coverage
(Company assessment based on Roland Berger Report).

Our customized products are highly integrated in our key customers’ value chains (sometimes protected by “key
supplier” relationships for major products), and we are closely aligned in demand planning and coordination. We
have flexible multi-purpose contract manufacturing plants that allow for optimized downtimes between different
product campaigns and change-overs. Furthermore, we benefit from six well-invested sites across the globe
offering reliability, safety and high product quality. As a result, we have developed a strong reputation of reliable
performance in delivering innovative products in large quantities to our clients. We also operate a global site
network with assets spanning the U.S., Europe and China, which we believe is unique among Tier 1 Crop Science
CDMOs.

**_Longstanding, Trusted Relationships with Diversified, Blue-Chip Customer Base_**

We have long-standing relationships with most of our blue-chip customers. We are a trusted partner to major
players in the Crop Science market and numerous leading specialties companies in the Life Science and
Performance Materials markets rely on our solutions and significant expertise for their products and applications.
High customer retention rates serve as a competitive moat against new entrants: For example, in 2021 and 2022,
we had an overall average customer retention rate of approximately 98% (based on existing customer revenue
over total revenue for the respective year), which illustrates, together with the high rate of contract renewal and
lock-in effects, the “stickiness” of our topline in Exclusives.

Our average duration of business relationships with our top four customers in Crop Science exceeds 15 years in
tenure (based on management estimates between 2020 and 2022) and a number of our Crop Science blue-chip
relationships span more than 30 years (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). Together with the high
revenue visibility that most of our longer-term contracts in Exclusives provide, our customers’ long-term
commitments are supported by a track record of co-investments in production facilities through upfront capital
expenditure or top-up pricing over the term of the contract. We supply a multitude of individual products to our
top customers, which we believe indicates our customers’ trust in our capabilities and the quality of our varied
products. In 2021 and 2022, we supplied more than 10 products for each of our top three customers.

-----

Our customer base in particular reflects our established position and depth of integration into their respective
value chains, with the top ten customers by revenue across all markets accounting for approximately 60%, based
on internal assessments, of our group-wide revenue in the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Our
established customer base in our CDMO Crop Science business includes the top five Crop Science majors across
all major crop systems in our key end-markets, with whom we work in close cooperation in terms of process
development and planning as well as the lifecycle of the project (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).
In addition, while agrochemicals are a key end-market for our products, we are diversifying into other applications
such as further high-value intermediates within Advanced Intermediates, pharmaceuticals and Specialties. For our
Exclusives products in particular, the close customer cooperation enables de-risked investments in growth capex
for further capacity and technology expansion through customer contributions (e.g., capex co-investment or ‘takeor-pay’ commitments by customers).

Over the last three years, we have established a track record of consistent project wins (at least one major 1 [st]
campaign project per year), building upon our deep integration into our customers’ value chains and our reputation
of reliability and ability to manage complex processes. As of March 31, 2023, we also had multiple projects in
varying ramp-up phases, supporting growth of the business. The growth capex associated with these ramp-up
projects mainly targets or has targeted capacity expansion for Exclusives and Specialties across our plants, and
production under these projects is expected to ramp-up over the short-term.

**_Attractive CDMO business model: high visibility, de-risked growth and recurring earnings_**

For our Exclusives products, we have developed strategic partnerships with well-known companies, including
some of the largest global agrochemicals producers, including blue chip customers in our key end-markets. Due
to our high level of integration into our customers’ product development and long contract terms for most of our
contracts, we have high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Our long-term contracts often
provide for guaranteed volumes in the initial period, contributing to a high contract renewal rate and low customer
churn for a large part of our portfolio. Because of our strong market position and customer integration, we also
have high visibility into our customers’ future demand and their upcoming product launches. For example, we
received customer inquiries from five top Crop Science players for 70% of all active ingredients launched or
planned to be launched in the market between 2020 and 2023E (calculated as share of novel active ingredients
and advanced/key intermediate launches where we were inquired) and have won projects in novel active
ingredients with these players at a success rate of approximately 40% (calculated as the share of projects won if
we were inquired).

Moreover, our customers in the CDMO business typically contractually agree for new products to either (i)
contribute a portion of the capital expenditures related to new product developments and the production line setup,
with minimum contract terms providing payback of the capital expenditures incurred directly by us, or (ii) firm
take-or-pay agreements with limited capital expenditures contributions upfront. We continue to invest
significantly in growth projects to deliver contracted new product wins and in maintenance to safeguard asset
reliability. Our disciplined selection criteria in our CDMO business are focused on superior contracts with limited
investment periods for growth capex projects where we typically target EBITDA pay-back periods of
approximately three years and return rates of approximately 25% IRR secured by binding customer capex or
offtake commitments. While this is not achieved in all our projects, we aim to strengthen our product portfolio
over time with projects that either match our key criteria or otherwise offer strategic opportunities.

We are well positioned to benefit from the ramp-up of contracted growth projects in Kokkola and Pratteln with
an existing agreement portfolio featuring ‘take-or-pay’ commitments. For more information, see also “⸺Our
_Product Portfolio.”_

**_Resilient Top-line Growth and Strong Margins with Significant Future Upside_**

We have shown our ability to maintain high revenue growth and margin stability, especially within Exclusives
and Specialties, driven by new product wins and strong demand in the existing portfolio, while maintaining
flexibility to changing market conditions through our ability to partially pass on increasing raw material and
energy costs. Most recently, we commissioned a new line of product under a ‘take-or-pay’ contract and secured a
new contract in our Exclusives business. Our major project wins over the last four years reflect our consistent
track-record of winning and delivering large-scale projects:

(1) Highest annual revenue achieved to date.

In addition, our rationalization of our portfolio to focus on high margin and growth products (e.g., DCA, GA for
skin care applications) as well as price increases in Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals have further
contributed to our successful performance. We have also been able to adjust our business to the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic without major impacts on our operations or financial results due to resilient demand from
Crop Science and Life Science customers. Driven by our management’s commitment to support high-value
products and projects, we have been able to consistently generate stable margins.

As a result, our revenue increased at a CAGR of 23.9% from €492.3 million for the financial year ended December
31, 2020 to €755.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue growth in 2022 was primarily
driven by strong demand in both our product groups across the portfolio supported by higher pricing effects, in
particular partial pass-through of increased raw material prices and supply chain costs in our Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group.

Our Adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 20.0% from €112.9 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 to €162.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The significant growth in
Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 in particular was due to an increase in pricing resulting in a higher margin for our
products from customers in our Exclusives and Specialties business as well as positive pricing effects in our
Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals business.

**_Backward-integrated model that enables re-use of by-products and reduction of waste_**

Increasing operational efficiency is a top priority for us as it provides clear benefits. When these benefits are
combined, they create a virtuous cycle by minimizing negative environmental impacts, creating cost advantages
in production, driving innovation and enabling our long-term competitiveness.

Production processes always result in byproducts. We aim to reuse or commercialize such byproducts wherever
feasible and avoid waste wherever possible. To this end, we believe we operate a highly efficient circular economy
processes and we eliminate waste by developing highly efficient processes with optimized product yields and
reusing materials within production cycles. Besides the environmental and sustainability advantages, this type of
closed-loop system also has tangible financial benefits, as it can reduce costs for raw materials and waste
treatments. In Pratteln, we are contributing to the creation of a circular economy using a “Verbund System”. This
enables highly efficient and sustainable chlorination and sulfonation reactions. Chlorine and sulfur trioxide are
produced as primary raw materials and used to manufacture a variety of chlorination and sulfonation reagents. In
turn, these are used to produce further downstream intermediates and active ingredients. The HCl and SO2
generated as off-gases are separated, purified and recycled, reused or resold.

Finally, our production sites benefit from high supply chain resilience through backward integration of key raw
materials and production processes for our Exclusives and Specialties Products (by using our Advanced
Intermediates production). In particular, our main multi-purpose plant in Pratteln uses an innovative set-up that
offers high efficiency production of Exclusives and Specialties products, based on backwards integration of the
key raw materials of chlorine. Together with the supply of large volumes of necessary MCA from our sites in
Germany, we can therefore contribute to supply resilience, as we are in control of the relevant production steps
and at the same time can manage the direct commercialization of side streams generated in the production
processes, which are then sold as Base Chemicals. See “⸺Production Facilities.” We benefit from close
proximity to our customers’ main production sites in the Western markets and we focus on developing and

maintaining strong logistic capabilities to enable seamless fulfillment and integration in the respective customer’s
supply chain. The chart below shows our production site locations around the world and our production
capabilities:

**_Focus on ESG and sustainability principles_**

We have made ESG one of our corporate priorities and consider it a key element of our success. Due to the nature
of our business and our position as a business partner deeply integrated into our customers’ supply chains, we are
aware of the importance of ESG in daily operations as our performance directly translates into the value chain and
ESG commitments of our partners.

We have underlined our sustainability commitment by committing to seven UN sustainable development goals,
signing the ‘UN Global Compact’, ‘Charta der Vielfalt’ and the ‘Responsible Care’ initiative. Our corporate
programs are based on external standards and assessments, and we have set up a special team as well as an ESG
management tool for implementing and monitoring our ESG measures. In 2022, we became a member of the
“Together for Sustainability” initiative, a collaboration of operating chemical companies that are committed to
sustainability throughout their value chains. From 2022 on, all our sites will undergo annual audits by Eco-Vadis
with the latest ratings conducted in 2022. Furthermore, our holistic approach to ESG is reflected by, among other
indicators, our twelve sustainability targets, which comprise seven targets by 2025 and five by 2030, respectively,
and by the role of ESG performance in management bonus schemes.

In addition, we are focused on our social responsibility and, as a result, strive to offer employees an attractive and
inspiring work environment that provides opportunities for individual development and growth. We focus on
promoting diversity as well as occupational health and safety as essential components for operational excellence.
See “Our Business⸺ESG and Sustainability.”

**_Focused, Credible Management Team with Proven Track Record_**

We have a highly qualified workforce alongside an experienced management team with deep industry experience.
Our management team has successfully repositioned CABB as an integrated CDMO platform and led a significant
step-up in growth and margin since 2018, effectively managing our continued success during the COVID-19
pandemic.

Our demonstrated track record has been achieved by strict contract discipline and a streamlined organizational
setup, while simultaneously leveraging efficiencies from OneCABB (which combined our legacy business units
into one integrated company to flatten the organizational structure and drive efficiencies across functions) and
making further improvements to operational excellence. This has been the basis of the successful transformation
of our business, developing a differentiated CDMO position with highly successful year-over-year improvements
over the past five years, including developing on our environmental, social and governance practices.

-----

We believe our management’s industry knowledge and leadership, combined with their long-term experience,
provide us with the skills necessary to continue improving performance and efficiency through a common
corporate infrastructure and the implementation of best practices across our network, which constitutes a
significant competitive advantage and drives our future.

On March 24, 2023, we announced that Thomas H. Ahrens will become the new chief executive officer of CABB
Group following Valerie Diele-Braun’s departure. Mr. Ahrens will join CABB on June 1, 2023 and succeed
Valerie Diele-Braun after a transition period of a few months. We believe Mr. Ahrens to be an experienced leader
who has a positive track record in driving sustainable growth and profitability. Building on his extensive industry
expertise, we believe he will strengthen the Group’s position as a premier contract development and
manufacturing organization and leading producer of proprietary ingredients for customers in the Life Science and
Performance Materials industries.

**Our Strategy**

The following is a summary of the activities we are currently undertaking in pursuit of these opportunities:

**_Deliver excellence in production to optimize profitability_**

We are focused on further developing our project portfolio and aim to add more high-value projects to our
portfolio each year, keeping in line with our historical project win rates. Our established market position in
Exclusives serves as the backbone of our strategy by continuously driving resilient growth and margin stability,
complemented by high growth in existing niche markets in Specialties and further supported by fundamental
market trends. We are dedicated to continue focusing on novel active ingredients and high-value products,
expanding our distribution and geographical reach in our Life Science applications and focusing on high-purity
and higher margin segments in Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals for attractive contracts with
increasing capacity. We aim to further increase our operational excellence by focusing on efficiency,
strengthening key account and sales functions, ramp-ups of additional capacities and continuous de-bottlenecking,
as well as fostering our commercial excellence by winning new customers from large, less reliable competitors in
the MCA business.

**_Deliver de-risked capacity and technology expansion_**

We will continue to strengthen our strategic positioning in Exclusives and Specialties by focusing on novel active
ingredients and investments in state-of-the-art technologies. We believe that we can benefit from a ramp-up in a
number of contracted and already invested projects across Exclusives and Specialties products with contractual
‘take-or-pay’ or exclusivity clauses which are underpinned by a well invested asset base that, as a result,
significantly reduces the risks associated with their execution. We expect to additionally benefit from leveraging
partial cost pass-through mechanisms in future contracts. Consequently, we believe our business is highly resilient
and that the predictable customer demand for our CDMO and other highly specialized products offers high
visibility on the underlying product lifecycle and returns for a certain part of the portfolio.

**_Strong focus on client relationships and varied commercial capabilities_**

We are dedicated to winning new projects by leveraging our long-standing relationships with our blue chip
customer base as well as our know-how and reputation as a trusted Western CDMO Crop Science business partner
to accelerate and win new contracts as proven in the past. In addition, we plan to further increase our Specialties
revenue through a push of our attractive portfolio to additional geographies and customers expanding the volume
of our high margin products.

Furthermore, as some of our main customer relationships exceed 15 years, we have established ourselves as a key
outsourcing partner with trusted supplier status for our clients worldwide who often return to extend existing
projects or to collaborate with us on potential new products. As a result, we have very low customer churn,
particularly for our Exclusives and Specialties offering, and our top customers work with us for a multitude of
individual products. We will continue to strengthen those long-standing customer relationships by working closely
with our customers to meet their volume and specification needs for their existing and new products. We intend
to expand our production capacity to meet the growing demand of our key customers, continue to optimize our
production processes to share efficiency gains and work closely with them to tailor our production processes to
new products.

We intend to continue to focus on multinational customers and industry leaders, in an effort to benefit from strong
innovation and global market penetration opportunities. By further strengthening our relationships with

8


-----

multinational customers who have leading market positions in their industries, we seek to grow with them as they
expand their businesses. The introduction of OneCABB has allowed us to further streamline our customers
primary points of contact with us and will, we believe, contribute to even stronger customer relationships.

**_Develop and further expand into additional markets_**

We remain focused on targeted capacity expansion to capture growing demand and additional production volumes
that our customers seek to outsource to us, in line with new growth projects of our customers. Jayhawk, located
in the United States, produces customized agricultural, pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals and continues to
offer the potential for standalone growth from its existing pipeline portfolio and production of new products, as
well as proximity to customers in the Americas. In addition, we believe our Pratteln and Kokkola sites have
benefited from cooperation with Jayhawk due to the fact that we can offer various technologies and additional
geographies and act in an agile manner according to their needs.

By focusing on high quality services, we plan to further capture rising needs in markets which deliver higher
margin profiles, for example, pharma, personal care, nutrition and performance materials. This will allow us to
capitalize our operating leverage and efficiency gains by, for example, planning to hold plant costs relatively
stable despite topline growth. We continue to focus on high capacity utilization as the key success factor for
sustainable development, as well as optimized logistics solutions such as the addition of our leased titanium fleet
of railcars which will allow for the delivery of more product with fewer railcars due to its lower weight and better
loading factor.

**_Maintain focus on profitability and cash flow_**

We will continue to focus on improving our profitability through cost savings and efficiency enhancements where
possible, such as investments in energy saving measures, footprint optimization and automatization. We believe
that there is an ongoing potential for efficiency measures through continuous optimization of our manufacturing
processes and recycling streams. We intend to seek to further improve cash flow generation by maximizing the
utilization of our production facilities and expanding our production capacity (e.g., in Kokkola and Jayhawk), as
well as continuing investments for maintenance to preserve our well-maintained asset base. At the same time, we
plan to remain disciplined in our growth capital expenditure projects by securing customers’ longer-term volume
commitments in advance and co-investments in the form of upfront capital expenditure or top-up pricing over the
terms of customers’ contracts.

**_Maintain health, safety and environmental excellence_**

We are committed to a strategy of ESG and sustainability based on environmentally responsible manufacturing
processes and ensuring the health and safety of our employees. We aim to benefit from the strong collaboration
on ESG and sustainability with customers and industry platforms to improve our sustainability footprint while
capitalizing on operating efficiencies. The strong collaboration on ESG in negotiations is based on joint
improvement programs further developing our green footprint in our customers’ value chain which, in turn, also
contributes to operational efficiencies. Our production facilities in Pratteln and Gersthofen play a significant role
in our effort to conserve energy and resources and to reduce emissions and waste. We believe measuring ourselves
at a high standard with respect to ESG and sustainability contributes not only to environmental and societal goals
but also makes us an even more attractive partner to our business partners in their selection of partners within their
value chain. See “Our Business⸺ESG and Sustainability.”

**Our History**

Our business has its origins in the chemical production activities of Hoechst AG, which originally commissioned
our production facility in Gersthofen, Germany, in 1905 as well as our production facility in Knapsack, Germany,
in 1949. In 1997, the Hoechst Specialty Chemicals business was acquired by Clariant. Several years later, in 2003,
the CABB Group GmbH was founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clariant before being acquired by an
Investment Management in 2005 and then by AXA Private Equity in the following year.

In 2007, we acquired SF Chem, including our production facility in Pratteln, Switzerland, which allowed us to
expand into contract manufacturing. In 2011, we were acquired by Bridgepoint; that same year we acquired
KemFine from 3i and commenced production at our facility in Kokkola, Finland, to further expand our contract
manufacturing capabilities.

In 2013, we expanded our footprint to Asia through the establishment of a joint venture with Jining Jinwei Gold
Power to acquire Jinwei Huasheng Chemicals. We hold a 67% stake in the joint venture entity CABB-Jinwei
Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co., Ltd.

In 2014, we were acquired by the Permira Funds and have since invested in an electrolysis plant in Pratteln,
capacity expansions and de-bottlenecking in most facilities as well as in a new wastewater facility in China.

In 2019, we acquired Evonik Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation, one of the leading fine chemicals companies
in the U.S., from Evonik Industries AG.

In 2021, we introduced OneCABB, which combined our legacy business units into one integrated company to
flatten the organizational structure and drive efficiencies across functions.

**Principal Shareholders**

Permira is a global investment firm that backs successful businesses with growth ambitions. Founded in 1985, the
firm advises funds with total assets under management of €77 billion and makes long-term majority and minority
investments. The Permira Funds have made approximately 300 private equity investments in four key sectors:
technology, consumer, healthcare and services. Permira employs over 450 people in 15 offices across Europe,
North America, and Asia.

**The Transactions**

**_The Refinancing_**

We intend to use the proceeds from the issue of the Notes, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) redeem the
Existing Notes in full (including paying the accrued and unpaid interest), (ii) pay the applicable redemption
premium for the Existing Notes, (iii) pay related fees and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”
On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will redeem and satisfy and discharge all of the Existing Notes by paying
the relevant redemption price for each of the Existing Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date
of redemption.

-----

**_The New Revolving Credit Facility_**

On April 20, 2023, we entered into our new senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of €110 million
which is not expected to be utilized at the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

We refer to the Offering, the Refinancing, including the redemption of the Existing Notes, the entry into the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the application of the use of proceeds as set out in the section “Use of
_Proceeds” as the “Transactions.” Please see “Use of Proceeds,” “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”_

**Recent Developments**

**_Changes in Group Management_**

On March 14, 2023, we announced that Valerie Diele-Braun, who currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer
of CABB Group, will step down from her position after the arrival and transition period to the new designated
CEO Thomas H. Ahrens. On March 24, 2023, we announced that Thomas H. Ahrens will become the new chief
executive officer of CABB Group. Mr. Ahrens will join CABB on June 1, 2023 and succeed Valerie Diele-Braun
after a transition period of a few months. See “Management.”

**Current Trading**

_The unaudited preliminary financial results for the periods presented below are derived from our accounting_
_records. This information has neither been audited, verified, reviewed or is subject to any procedures by any_
_external auditors nor has it been approved by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, you should not place undue_
_reliance on such unaudited preliminary financial results, and no opinion or any other form of assurance is_
_provided with respect thereto. Our unaudited preliminary financial results are based upon a number of_
_assumptions and judgments that are subject to inherent uncertainties and are subject to review, change and_
_adjustment in the course of preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and are not intended to be a_
_comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the periods presented. Although we believe_
_the management estimates and unaudited preliminary financial information and the assumptions on which they_
_are based to be reasonable, our preliminary financial results are subject to change, and are not intended to be a_
_comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results as of and for the three months ended March 31,_
_2023. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain of the factors that could_
_affect our future performance and results of operation._

Based on preliminary results derived from unaudited management monthly accounts and other information
currently available, we estimate that our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased to
approximately €207.1 million from €181.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, representing an
estimated increase of approximately 14.0% compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily
driven by price increases in both product groups ‘Exclusives and Specialties’ as well as ‘Advanced Intermediates
and Base Chemicals.’

We estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased to approximately
€55.2 million from €33.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, representing an estimated increase
of approximately 63.3% compared to the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to the pricing
driven top line growth which offset the increases in variable and fix costs compared to the three months ended 31
March 2022.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we expect our Adjusted EBITDA to grow in the low single-digit
percentage range primarily due to continued growth in Exclusives and Specialties as well as Advanced
Intermediates, compensated by an expected normalization of the caustic soda price.

(2) In this Offering Memorandum, we present the consolidated annual financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., for the financial

years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. is not a member of the restricted group (the
“Restricted Group”) subject to the covenants under the Indenture, which comprise the Issuer and the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries,
and will not guarantee the Notes. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds
therefrom, the only material assets of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. will be its equity ownership in the Issuer. References to the “Group”
are to Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. On June 26, 2014, Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A.
and the Issuer entered into the Senior Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement. The Senior Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement will be cancelled
and the Senior Notes Proceeds Loan will be repaid in connection with the redemption of the Existing Senior Notes.

(3) As part of the Group’s corporate strategy, Monitchem HoldCo 2 S.A. and the Issuer may in the future change their legal form into a

German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) and migrate their effective place of management from
Luxembourg to Germany (the “Migration”).

(4)  On October 7, 2019, Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. issued €150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 9.500% senior notes due 2026

(the “Existing Senior Notes”). The Existing Senior Notes are expected to be redeemed in full in connection with the Transactions.

(5) On October 7, 2019, the Issuer issued €315,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.250% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2025

(the “Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes”) and €175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its senior secured floating rate
notes due 2025 (the “Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes,
the “Existing Senior Secured Notes” and, together with the Existing Senior Notes, the “Existing Notes”). The Existing Senior Secured
Notes are expected to be redeemed in full in connection with the Transactions. The Notes will be the Issuer’s general, senior obligations
and will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes, including obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement (as defined herein), certain
cash management obligations, if any, and certain hedging obligations, if any, and rank senior in right of payment to any existing and
future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, if any. The Notes will be guaranteed on
a senior basis (the “Notes Guarantees” and each, a “Notes Guarantee”) (i) on or about the Issue Date, by CABB Group GmbH and (ii)
within 120 days of the Issue Date, by the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined herein) (each a “Guarantor” and together, the
“Guarantors”). The Notes Guarantee issued by each Guarantor will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future
obligations of that Guarantor that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including indebtedness
incurred under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations) and rank senior in right of payment to
any existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, if
any. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of the enforcement of the security, the holders of the Notes will receive
proceeds from the Collateral and distressed disposals only after obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and
certain super-senior hedging and cash management obligations have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

(6) On April 20, 2023, CABB Group GmbH, as borrower and guarantor and the Issuer, as guarantor, entered into the New Revolving Credit

Facilities Agreement which provides for the €110 million New Revolving Credit Facility. We expect that the New Revolving Credit
Facility will be undrawn on the Issue Date. The New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the same entities
that guarantee the Notes and will be secured on a first priority basis over the same collateral securing the Notes and certain hedging and
cash management obligations. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement.”

(7) As of and for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, the Guarantors represented 99.5% of Adjusted EBITDA (disregarding the

EBITDA of any member of the Group that generates negative EBITDA).

obligations (if any), the Security Agent, any receiver and certain creditor
representatives have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The security interests in the Collateral may be limited by applicable law
or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and
enforceability. See “Description of the Notes—Security,” “Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes.”_

The security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain
circumstances. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

**Use of Proceeds .................................... The gross proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on**

balance sheet, will be used to (i) redeem the Existing Notes in full
(including paying the accrued and unpaid interest), (ii) pay the applicable
redemption premium for the Existing Notes, and (iii) pay related fees and
expenses.

**Optional Redemption:**

Floating Rate Notes ............................... The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Floating Rate Notes at any time

on or after May 1, 2024 at the redemption prices as described under
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

At any time prior to May 1, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or part of
the Floating Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption plus a “make-whole” premium,
as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Fixed Rate Notes ................................... The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate Notes at any time on

or after May 1, 2025 at the redemption prices as described under
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

At any time prior to May 1, 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or part of
the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to the date of redemption plus a “make-whole” premium, as
described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

At any time prior to May 1, 2025, the Issuer may on one or more
occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Fixed Rate Notes, using the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at
a redemption price equal to 108.75% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the

17


-----

date of redemption; provided that at least 50% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes remains outstanding after the redemption.

At any time prior to May 1, 2025, the Issuer may redeem, during each
12-month period commencing on the Issue Date, up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes outstanding at its
option, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the
principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any.

**Additional Amounts; Tax**
**Redemption .......................................... Any payments made by or on behalf of either Issuer or any Guarantor in**

respect of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee will be made
without withholding or deduction for taxes in any relevant taxing
jurisdiction unless required by law. Subject to certain exceptions and
limitations, if either the Issuer, any Guarantor or the paying agent is
required by law to withhold or deduct such taxes with respect to a
payment on any Note, the Issuer or such Guarantor will pay the additional
amounts necessary so that the net amount received by each holder after
such withholding is not less than the amount that would have been
received in the absence of the withholding.

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction become
effective after the issuance of the Notes that would impose withholding
taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes, and would
require the Issuer or any Guarantor to pay additional amounts (as defined
in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”), the Issuer or any
Guarantor may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time,
at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption.

**Change of Control ............................... Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer**

may be required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have
occurred on one occasion if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is
not exceeded as a result of such event. See “Description of the Notes.”

**Certain Covenants ............................... The Indenture, among other things, will restrict the ability of the Issuer**

and its restricted subsidiaries, to:

                      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                      - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain
investments;

                      - make certain other restricted payments;

                      - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                      - impose restrictions on the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries
to pay dividends;

                      - transfer or sell certain assets;

                      - merge or consolidate with other entities;

18


-----

                      - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                      - impair the security interests created for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes; and

                      - (in case of the Issuer only) engage in activities other than
certain permitted holding company activities.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the Notes obtain and
maintain an investment-grade rating.

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Transfer Restrictions ........................... The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be,**

registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and
resale. See “Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors,” “Notice to Certain
_European Investors” and “Notice to Residents of Canada.” We have not_
agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Notes under the
securities laws in any jurisdiction (including by way of an exchange
offer).

**Original Issue Discount ....................... Because the Floating Rate Notes will be issued with original issue**

discount (“OID”),, U.S. holders of Floating Rate Notes (as defined
under “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”)
generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as
ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual
method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders of Floating Rate Notes
will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of
cash attributable to such income. See “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal
_Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue Discount.”_

**No Established Market for the**
**Notes ..................................................... The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no**

established trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers have advised
us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated
to do so and they may discontinue market making at any time without
notice. Accordingly, there is no assurance that an active trading market
will develop for the Notes.

**Listing ................................................... Application will be made to admit the Notes to listing on the Securities**

Official List of the LuxSE, without admission to trading on one of the
securities markets operated by the LuxSE.

**Governing Law .................................... The Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be governed by**

the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of articles 470-1 to 470-19 of the Luxembourg act dated
August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended are not
applicable to the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement and the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement will be governed by English law.
The security documents will be governed by the applicable law of the
jurisdiction under which the security interests are granted.

**Trustee .................................................. Deutsche Trustee Company Limited.**

**Security Agent ...................................... GLAS Trust Corporation Limited.**

(1) We define Reported EBITDA as the Group’s net result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial results, amortization and
depreciation. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial result, amortization and
depreciation and adjustments for expenses and income not related to the operational performance of the business activities, such as
strategic projects, restructuring and reorganization measures, financial impacts of natural disasters, property damage insurance
compensations, as well as valuation impacts resulting from curtailments or modifications to pension or post-retirement benefits schemes
and purchase price allocations. We believe that both Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors in evaluating our
operating performance and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness. Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not
performance indicators recognized under IFRS. The Reported EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA reported are not necessarily
comparable to the performance figures published by other companies as Reported EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA or the like. You should
exercise caution in comparing Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by us to Reported EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA
of other companies. For more information, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.” The
following table is a reconciliation of the Group’s net result for the period to Reported EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, as
defined by us, for the periods presented:

(2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

(3) Capital Expenditure is defined as acquisition of intangible assets plus acquisition of property, plant and equipment as stated in the cash

flow statement. Total Capital Expenditure includes paid capital expenditures only.

(4) Cash Generation is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash flow from investing activities.

(5) Cash Conversion is defined as Cash Generation divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

(6) Operating Net Working Capital is defined as Group Net Working Capital minus purchase price allocation (“PPA”) valuation on
inventory plus net working capital of holding entities plus net income tax receivables. Group Net Working Capital is defined as
inventories plus accounts receivable, trade plus contract assets plus other non-financial receivables plus income tax receivables minus
accounts payable, trade minus contract liabilities minus income tax liabilities minus other non-financial liabilities.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of each of Group Net Working Capital and Operating Net Working Capital:

(1) _Pro forma_ net senior secured debt consists of the Notes _less_ cash and cash equivalents. For purposes of this item, cash and cash

equivalents are measured as of December 31, 2022 as adjusted on a pro forma basis to give effect to the Transactions, including the
Offering of the Notes and the application of the proceeds from the Offering, and as further adjusted for the expected repayment of
drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility in full in April 2023. See “Capitalization”.

(2) _Pro forma net total debt consists of the Notes and other financial debt less cash and cash equivalents. For purposes of this item, cash and_

cash equivalents are measured as of December 31, 2022 as adjusted on a pro forma basis to give effect to the Transactions, including
the Offering of the Notes and the application of the proceeds from the Offering, and as further adjusted for the expected repayment of
drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility in full in April 2023. See “Capitalization”.

(3) _Pro forma cash interest expense reflects the estimated interest expense on the Notes for financial year ended December 31, 2022 as if_

the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2022, based on the coupon of the Notes, assuming, with respect to the Floating Rate Notes,
a constant EURIBOR rate (with a zero floor) for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 based on the current spot three-month
EURIBOR rate, plus the commitment fees relating to our New Revolving Credit Facility, which will be undrawn on the Issue Date. As
adjusted total cash interest expense excludes charges related to allocated debt issuance costs and hedging costs. Pro forma cash interest
expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually
been had the Transactions occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our
financial condition at any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this_
_Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the Notes. The_
_risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of_
_which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition and results of operations. If any of the events described below were to occur, our business,_
_financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the_
_trading prices of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due_
_and you could lose all or part of your investment. The order in which these risks are presented is not intended to_
_provide an indication of the likelihood of their occurrence or their severity or significance._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Please see_
_“Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to the Industry in Which We Operate**

**_Economic downturns or worsening global economic conditions may adversely impact our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operation and cash flows._**

Our business is affected by changes in the general economic conditions of the industries and market segments in
which we sell our products, including, in particular, the Crop Science (e.g., herbicides, fungicides, insecticides
and other livestock and crop protection products) and Life Science (e.g., pharma, personal care, nutrition,
fragrances and flavor applications) markets, as well as the market for Performance Materials (e.g., curatives in
epoxies, polyimides, polyesters and other resin systems used for electronic components, semiconductors and for
composites, fibers, films, and foams that provide heat and electrical resistance). Any change in demand or in the
application of our products within these end-markets or the failure to accurately predict or adapt to future market
trends may negatively impact our sales and margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Based on our internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of all our products were used in the Crop
Science market in 2022 (measured as a percentage of revenues). Historically, the Crop Science market has
experienced seasonal declines due to, among other things, decreasing crop commodity prices and subsequently
lower net cash income for farmers, lower pest threats which negatively affects demand for pesticides, trade
restrictions, inclement long-term weather conditions and economic recession in production markets such as in
Brazil. While the market for Crop Science has grown each year for the past three years, any future market trends
are inherently uncertain and any declines in demand for Crop Science (as well as in any other end-market) could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. This
industry is driven by structural long-term trends, such as population growth combined with an increasing calorie
intake per capita, in particular in emerging markets, and decreasing arable land per capita. Furthermore, over the
past decades, Crop Science products have become increasingly complex and newer products are required to
replace old ones, driven by either regulatory requirements or the search for more effective formulations (Roland
Berger Report, Company Information) and we may not be successful in offering the products required by our
customers. See also “⸺Risks Related to Our Business⸺We are dependent on a small number of Customers and
_Key Products for a significant portion of our revenue.”_

In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 20% of our products were used in the Life
Science market (measured as a percentage of revenues). This market is affected by several long-term trends,
including an aging population driving an increase in chronic diseases and leading to more spending on, and
demand for, pharmaceutical and personal care products, as well as a growing middle class that is leading to an
increasing sedentary lifestyle (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). However, innovations and
technological progress in the pharmaceutical industry, including production processes of pharmaceutical products,
as well as changes in access to medical care, changes in the ability of end-customers to pay for medical care and
regulatory approval of certain medical therapies by public health authorities such as the FDA (as defined below),
can affect demand for our products in the Life Science market and we may not be successful in offering the
products required by our customers. Furthermore, changes in general economic conditions directly impact
consumer confidence and spending as well as the general business climate and levels of business investment. This
may directly affect our customers in the food, personal care and cosmetics industries and ultimately our business,

financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. See also “⸺Risks Related to Our Business⸺We are
_dependent on a small number of Customers and Key Products for a significant portion of our revenue.”_

Finally, the growth of the Performance Materials market is expected to correlate to the general economic
conditions measured by GDP. In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 15% our
products were used in the Performance Materials market (measured as a percentage of revenues). Declines in the
electronics and semiconductors end-markets or specific industrial and infrastructure applications (e.g. hot air
filtration), or other disruptions affecting these niche applications could have a material adverse effect on the
demand for our Performance Materials products and therefore on our business, financial condition, results of
operation and cash flows.

Similarly, other products, such as caustic soda, that are generated as by-products from our Exclusives and
Advanced Intermediates production lines, might be affected by similar declines in their respective end-markets or
changes in supply and demand balances. For example, the market price of some of our products, e.g. caustic soda,
and raw materials we use in our production declined in 2020 and 2021, thereby negatively impacting the
contribution of some of our products to profitability for the financial years 2020 and 2021, but subsequently
significantly increased in 2022 and, in the case of caustic soda, reached an all-time high. However, the market
price for some our products, including caustic soda, is expected to normalize (approximately €400-600/t (WE spot
rate)) and may be exposed to future fluctuations due to macro-economic or other risks which could affect the
pricing in Base Chemicals and Advanced Intermediates.

Continued elevated levels of political and economic uncertainty, increased interest rates, rising inflation, price
volatility and shortages in raw materials and energy, increased transportation costs and climate chaos could have
unpredictable consequences and may lead to a global economic downturn, potentially affecting demand for all
our products. In addition, in Europe, past and potential future changes to monetary policy, continuing doubts about
the future of the Eurozone, insufficient deleveraging in the private and public sectors and an elevated level of
political instability could adversely affect our operations. In the United States, uncertainties associated with
policies adverse to international trade implemented in recent years (for example with China), both nationally and
internationally, have led to market volatility and political uncertainty. Also, any imposition of tariffs as a result of
economic or political tensions may affect, for example, costs for obtaining raw materials necessary to our business.
Should such developments arise again and lead to a global economic downturn, it may reduce demand for goods
that incorporate our products and, in turn, our customers’ demand for our products.

All of the above could negatively impact our sales and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting sanctions and measures taken against Russia have had and may_**
**_have, and those that may be taken against any other countries in the future may have, further adverse material_**
**_effects on the global economy, energy supplies and prices, and may have severe adverse effects on the_**
**_operations of energy-intensive sectors (e.g., heavy industry, chemical manufacturers, metallurgy, pharma,_**
**_etc.)._**

Geopolitical tensions, including but not limited to, tensions between Russia and its neighboring countries,
including Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic countries, tensions between China and the United States or acts of
terrorism, could also negatively affect the demand for and supply of our merchandise. In late February 2022,
Russian military forces launched a significant military action against Ukraine, which has resulted in sustained
conflict and disruption in the region. We do not have any direct revenue exposure to Russia or Ukraine; however,
we are aware that some of our customers subsequently distribute our products or incorporate our products into the
production of their goods which, in certain circumstances, are distributed, and may continue to be distributed in
the future, into Russia or Ukraine in reliance upon exemptions from sanctions in the crop protection and
pharmaceuticals markets. To date we have not experienced any material disruption to our operations, however,
the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable. This conflict
has led to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in energy and other commodity
prices, financial markets, supply chain disruptions and changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, as well as
increases in cyberattacks and espionage. See “⸺Economic downturns or worsening global economic conditions
_may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.”_

Russia’s annexation of Crimea and subsequent military action against Ukraine have led to sanctions being levied
by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries
against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s
Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, including, among others, the removal of certain Russian

-----

financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment
system, which can significantly hinder the ability to transfer funds in and out of Russia. The situation is rapidly
evolving as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom
and other countries or jurisdictions may implement additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against
Russia or other countries, regions, officials, individuals or industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions
and other measures, as well as any potential responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions
and military actions, has adversely affected the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “⸺Risks Relating to Legal Matters⸺We must
_comply with foreign trade laws, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-trust, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption_
_laws across the jurisdictions in which we operate.”_

We are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine, including the increase in energy prices associated therewith,
and are assessing its impact on our business. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the conflict
in Ukraine or its impacts in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus as the conflict and any resulting government reactions are
rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting
market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and
our business for an unknown period of time.

In addition, evolving policy dispute between China and the United States and other international communities
may result in sanctions and other measures against China in the future, which may adversely impact our business.
An escalation of trade tensions between the countries we operate in and China, including if China were to, or is
perceived to, provide support to Russia in the war in Ukraine or to circumvent economic sanctions imposed against
Russia and its allies, may result in sanctions from the United States and the other countries we operate in against
China and its constituents. To the extent such sanctions are put in place, our operations in China (including
operations of our joint venture in China) may be significantly restricted. Moreover, such sanctions may also
potentially result in the loss of business from our top customers, suppliers, distributors and/or other counterparts
if they impose restrictions on our dealings with such parties as where, for example, such parties are owned or
controlled by or otherwise affiliated with one or more Chinese person or entity.

Any of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this Offering Memorandum.

**_We are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions._**
**_We are highly regulated and may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with, or address liabilities_**
**_under, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business._**

The chemical industry is subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the
jurisdictions in which we operate or do business, including requirements under governing licenses and permits
with regard to air emissions (e.g. CO2 and NOx emissions reduction requirements), energy efficiency (e.g. energy
usage reduction), water discharge, the use, management, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of waste
and other materials, the protection and restoration of plants, wildlife, natural resources and public health and
safety, product safety and content, the investigation and remediation of contaminated land, and worker- and
product-related health and safety, as well as numerous related reporting and record keeping requirements.

We are required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in relation to our production
and distribution processes, and the relevant regulatory authorities carry out regular inspections to ascertain our
compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. The demands of compliance may require us to incur
substantial costs, including capital requirements, clean-up costs, fines or penalties, and/or may restrict our ability
to conduct our operations or to do so profitably, and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business
and results of operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also lead to public
reprimand, fines or other sanctions, loss of ability to operate and/or sell within certain jurisdictions and damage
to our goodwill and reputation and could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

We cannot ensure that we will in the future be able to obtain and finance all permits which we require for our
business operations. Such failure or any violation of the terms and conditions of such permits, permitting delays
or revocation of existing permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.

We also cannot ensure whether or not future administrative action, laws, regulations, international treaties or
policies will ban or restrict the usage of some of our products or their respective ingredients or substances in the

27


-----

future. For example, in early 2023, the French food safety authority ANSES initiated a procedure to withdraw
authorization of the main uses of plant protection products containing the active substance S-Metolachlor
(SMOC), one of our products, because of groundwater pollution and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)
published a restriction proposal on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that would effectively ban all
forms of PFAS currently in use, apart from active ingredients in medicines, pesticides and biocidal substances.
Although France’s ban on SMOC would have a limited impact on our business and although we are closely
monitoring further policy measures as well as legal and administrative actions, we cannot exclude with certainty
whether the European Union or other countries will adopt further restrictions on SMOC. Any ban on our products
or their respective ingredients or substances or any ban on the exportation of such products could impact our
operations, including the closure of production lines in our facilities where they have been specifically tailored
for the production of a certain product, and/or our business partners’ value chain and could require additional
costs associated with internal restructurings, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also “⸺Risks Relating to Legal Matters⸺We must
_comply with foreign trade laws, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-trust, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption_
_laws across the jurisdictions in which we operate and “⸺We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration_
_proceedings, including litigation related expenses and/or reputational damage, among other losses, which could_
_harm our business.”_

**_Competition in our markets may adversely affect our market share, margins and overall profitability._**

Our industry is competitive and we face competition from several CDMO producers for our Exclusives products,
as well as competition from other large international chemical manufacturers and smaller regional competitors for
other parts of our business. We may face increased competition in the future from other potential new entrants in
our markets. Competition is based on several key criteria, including technology and technological capabilities,
product quality, proprietary technologies and know-how, innovation and performance, production capacity,
attractive pricing, geography, security, speed of supply and responsiveness to product development in cooperation
with customers.

Some of our existing competitors are, and potential future competitors may be, larger than we are (e.g., by revenue
or geographical coverage), may have greater financial resources and may also be able to maintain significantly
greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to better withstand
changes in conditions within our industry, fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and energy and changes in
general economic conditions. Additionally, competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to lower our prices or
lead to loss of customers or products and, as a consequence, additional costs for investments into replacement
products and/or internal restructurings, which could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. See
“Risks Related to Our Business⸺We are dependent on a small number of customers and Key Products for a
_significant portion of our revenue.”_

Further, our competitors may undertake to expand their production capacity, which could lead to a shift in supply
and negative pricing impacts on our products. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will
continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by
improving production efficiency and volume, focusing on higher margin products and improving efficiency of
operations through innovation. If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we
could lose a portion of our market share to our competitors.

**_Changes in the agricultural and certain other policies of governments and international organizations may_**
**_adversely impact the Crop Science industry and prove unfavorable to us._**

The policies of governments and international organizations may affect the income available to growers to
purchase Crop Science products used in agricultural production. In subsidized markets such as the United States,
Europe and certain markets in Asia, including Japan, reduction of subsidies to growers may inhibit the growth of
markets for products used in agriculture. In addition, changes in governmental policies that impact agriculture
may similarly inhibit the growth of markets for products used in agriculture. Specifically, government programs
that create incentives for farmers (for example, the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard) may be modified or
discontinued. However, it is difficult to predict accurately whether, and if so when, such changes will occur.
Should such changes occur, we may experience decreased demand for our products, which would adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We expect that the policies of governments
and international organizations will continue to affect the planting choices made by growers as well as the
subsidies available to growers to purchase products used in agriculture and, accordingly, the results of our
operations in the agriculture industry.

**_The spread of the 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has had, and the outbreak of another infectious disease or_**
**_other serious public health concern around the world could have, a negative impact on economies, financial_**
**_markets and business activities._**

As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 and early 2020 and its spread into numerous countries across
the globe, governmental authorities have imposed, and may in the future continue to impose, quarantine zones or
lockdowns nationally or on certain cities and regions, all of which have significantly impacted and could continue
to impact international, national and regional economic development. Governmental restrictions as well as
concerns for the health of employees or confirmed infection cases in our production plants worldwide have caused
in the past and may cause in the future, temporary full or partial plant shutdowns and increased costs for protective
measures such as staggered schedules, cleaning costs and costs for protective equipment. Uncertainty regarding
future developments remains high and there are risks of future supply chain disruptions, increased prices and
unavailability of raw materials, production shutdowns, declining demand for our products or problems with
shipping products internationally, that could result in higher costs of our products. Furthermore, demand for
certain products may fluctuate in the future, negatively affecting our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

The Company has not experienced any material negative impact from COVID-19 with respect to customer
demand in the Crop Science and Life Science industries or any significant cancellation of contracts or confirmed
orders from our customers. However, some of our plants, such as Jayhawk in the United States, have experienced
temporary full or partial shutdowns due to a rise in number of infections and our plants may experience such
shutdowns in the future. The extent of the adverse impact of an infectious disease or other serious public health
concern, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on the global economy and markets as well as on our business,
operations and financial results is difficult to predict. Such impacts will depend on the measures taken to limit the
spread and counter its impact and on the size and effectiveness of the compensating measures taken by
governments, as well as how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.
Failure to manage the risks mentioned above and other risks related to an outbreak of an infectious disease (or a
new mutation of an existing infectious disease) or other serious public health concern could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We are dependent on a small number of Customers and Key Products for a significant portion of our revenue._**

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from several large customers and key products and the loss of any
such customer or key product would negatively impact our operations. For the financial year ended December 31,
2022, based on internal assessments, our top ten customers across all markets accounted for approximately 60%
of our total revenue. Our top 5 Exclusives products accounted for approximately 40% of our Exclusives and
Specialties revenue in the financial year ended December 31, 2022 and our top 5 Specialties products generated
approximately 15% of our Exclusives and Specialties revenue in the same period. Similarly, our top 5 Advanced
Intermediates products generated approximately 60% of our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals revenue
in the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Our inability to maintain our customer relationships with key
customers or otherwise retain their business at current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. This applies across almost all our product groups.

We may lose customers or key products because of, among other things, industry consolidation, customer
dissatisfaction, competition, our customers’ products becoming obsolete, product quality and impurity concerns
or customers finding cheaper alternative products. Our sales would be adversely affected if customers who
currently outsource manufacturing of certain products to us decide to source such products internally or with one
of our competitors. For example, one of our customers has decided not to renew a supply contract for a key product
that is due to expire in 2024, which generated a mid single digit percentage of revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2022.

In addition, since certain of our products are difficult and expensive to transport over long distances, if local or
regional customers were no longer to buy such products, we may encounter difficulties in finding other customers
in the same area, which could lead to a decrease in our sales. Furthermore, we supply some of our customers,
particularly for our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals, without formal agreements in the open market,
which results in lower switching costs for our customers and reduces our ability to predict our sales to such
customers in the long-term.

29


-----

Several of our key customers require us to undergo a manufacturer certification process for new products in
connection with the registration they undergo when registering a new product or formulation. This may involve
an inspection by the customer’s own testing team of the product itself, focusing on quality testing, and of our
manufacturing process by conducting plant audits. These manufacturer certifications are essential, because no
sales to these customers can occur without such certifications. The testing is rigorous and can be time-consuming.
We currently hold many certifications from key customers, but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience
difficulties in retaining existing and obtaining new certifications as and when necessary. Failure to retain existing
certifications or obtain new certifications may result in the loss of such customers.

Any loss of, or significant reduction in demand from, one or more of our significant customers or termination of
contracts with regards to any key product could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

**_Changes in our customers’ products or processes can reduce the demand for our products._**

Our customers use our products for a broad range of applications. Changes in our customers’ products or processes
may result in our customers reducing the volume of products they outsource to us or otherwise purchase from us,
or even make our products unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative chemicals or processes that no longer
require our products. For example, should a customer in Crop Science, Life Science or Performance Materials
decide to use a different active ingredient or intermediate due to price, performance or other considerations, we
may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements. In some instances, we are the
key supplier to our customers with respect to selected key products. Consequently, the success of our products
depends, to a significant extent, on the success of our customers’ own products in the relevant end-market.
Conversely, new digitalization and technological advances could also lead to more efficient farming (through
genetically modified seeds and more precise weather predictions) and our chemical products could ultimately be
used more efficiently by our customers such that there is a decrease in demand. For example, genetically modified
organisms could reduce or replace the need for insecticides or other Crop Science products. In addition, the
improved availability and accuracy of field data could lead to more precision and efficiency in the use of
herbicides, fungicides and insecticides for crop protection purposes and likewise lower the demand for our Crop
Science products. Similarly, newly launched products might not reach the expected performance due to lack of
sufficient demand in certain end-markets or customers decide to purchase lower volumes of our products.

Any reduction in demand for herbicides, fungicides and insecticides products for which we supply advanced
chemicals and active ingredients to our customers could negatively impact demand for our products. Additionally,
our results of operations are influenced by the evolving nature of regulations impacting the industries in which
our customers operate. We are also dependent on our customers’ continuous development of new products and
their need for our production and technical expertise. If our customers were to fail to develop new products for
which they outsource manufacturing to us, or if they otherwise do not require our production facilities or
production facility capacity, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.

**_We rely on long-term contracts for a certain part of our revenue and growth prospects._**

For our CDMO business in Exclusives products, we produce specialized chemical products (mainly in Crop
Science) in partnership with our clients to ensure we match their specific requirements and quality expectations.
This requires significant ramp-up times and costs to set-up appropriate production lines and processes. We commit
to such long-term projects (under contractual frameworks) with the expectation that we will recover our initial
investments in the short-term and achieve desired returns and profitability growth in the mid- to long-term. The
expected returns under these long-term contracts for Exclusives products account for a certain portion of our
Group’s future growth and profitability prospects and if the actual returns do not match our expectations or if the
contracts are breached, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Additionally, our CDMO contracts in Exclusives typically feature a minimum contractual length, as well as other
mechanisms (e.g., co-investments by customers), targeting the recovery of our capital expenditure (“Capex”) for
the project. We cover part of our initial Capex either through an initial investment from our clients or through
contractual ‘take-or-pay’ clauses committing the clients to minimum purchase volumes and prices for an initial
period. While this contribution from our clients to our costs helps integrate our services into their value chains
and adds to their potential cost to switch suppliers, the custom production lines and processes developed this way
are usually product specific and cannot be easily re-purposed in case a contract is terminated or otherwise

30


-----

modified. Should our customers refuse to renew existing contracts with such clauses, our profitability might be
impacted.

Furthermore, should a customer choose to exercise a force majeure clause, or otherwise refuse to tender payment
for our services or terminate our contract, this would lead to losses or write-offs or additional costs on our part
(such as increased storage and other costs). Conversely, we may be unsuccessful in exercising a force majeure
clause ourselves, and as a result incur additional expenses under a contract that is no longer generating the
expected returns. Furthermore, if such contracts are terminated for cause, or modified or breached by ourselves or
our customers, we may not receive payment for our capital expenditures or generate the expected returns, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our results of operations may be affected by our inability to meet our customers’ requirements in terms of_**
**_product quality, specifications or other terms._**

Our products may fail to meet our customers’ expectations in terms of quality, performance or otherwise, which
may result in reputational harm, customers reducing the volume of orders they place with us or having to replace
products at our expense. As many of our products are critical to, or enhance the performance of, our customers’
applications and products, our customers rely on us to provide them with products that meet their specifications
and quality requirements. Our quality control systems and in-process production controls provide for regular
inspection of our products. However, there can be no assurance that our products will meet agreed specifications
or quality requirements, will not contain impurities or be mistakenly co-mingled with other products (for example,
due to mislabeling) when initially produced. In the past, prior to distribution to the customer, our controls have
identified completed products which have failed to meet customer specifications. In such instances, we have been
required to re-run the manufacturing process to achieve the proper specifications, which has resulted in loss of
revenue due to the need to deliver replacements at our own expense, reduction in sales volume due to the loss of
diverted production capacity and delayed delivery of product to customers. Our contracts with our customers
require our products to meet agreed specifications or quality requirements and therefore we may face similar
consequences if we fail to detect such quality deficiencies in the first instance or otherwise deliver products which
do not meet these requirements. In the event our quality systems identify issues only after shipping, we could
further face the possibility of a recall, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial additional work
or destruction of material. Furthermore, some of our customers may ask us to manage the whole supply chain
process (raw material sourcing, production and delivery) which would require increased resources and working
capital, and therefore funding. If we are unable to obtain additional funding in order to finance increased working
capital, we could fail to meet our customers’ demands. Any of these failures could also result in reputational harm
and customers’ placing orders for lower volumes with us, which could also have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in several different countries._**

We currently have manufacturing facilities located in Germany, Switzerland, Finland, the United States and
China. Our operations in these countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic
growth; political or (macro-)economic conditions; availability and prices of raw materials and energy; supply
chain disruptions; expropriation or other governmental actions; regulatory actions (including bans or restrictions
on the usage of some of our products or their respective ingredients or substances); social unrest, war, terrorist
activities or other armed conflict; bribery and corruption; national and regional labor strikes; confiscatory taxation
or other adverse tax policies; deprivation of contract rights; trade restrictions and regulations affecting production,
pricing and marketing of products; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions on the
repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls and export restrictions; inflation; currency fluctuations and
devaluation; the effect of global environmental, health and safety issues on economic conditions (including severe
weather conditions), market opportunities and operating restrictions; and changes in financial policy and
availability of credit. These factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**_We may be unable to successfully implement our business strategies and capital expenditure plans._**

Our future financial performance and success depend on our ability to implement our business strategy
successfully. We continue to focus on efficiency improvement initiatives to optimize our asset base, increase
operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. We also continue to select suitable materials to build various
process equipment, estimate raw material usage ratios, production capacity and waste generation as part of our
business strategy. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement our business
strategies or that implementing these strategies will sustain or improve, rather than harm, our results of operations.

31


-----

In particular, we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency or asset utilization or
achieve other cost savings, such as the operational efficiency measures we are currently implementing in all of
our international production facilities. In addition, the costs involved in implementing our strategies may be
greater than we currently anticipate. For example, we have invested more than €25 million into a new production
train in our Kokkola facility in Finland and we expanded into the United States in 2019 when the Permira Funds
acquired Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries, including Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation and its
production facility in Galena, Kansas, United States. However, our ability to continue similar capacity expansions
in our production facilities may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory
approvals, the availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards, such as weather conditions and natural
disasters, internal restructurings due to loss of customers or key products and other risks customarily associated
with construction projects, including access to credit. See “We are dependent on a small number of Customers
_and Key Products for a significant portion of our revenue.”_

Moreover, the capital expenditure that we estimate for use in such capacity expansion projects may be insufficient
to cover the actual cost. We may experience cost overruns, and the cost of capacity expansion projects could have
a negative impact on our financial results until capacity utilization is sufficiently high to absorb the incremental
costs associated with the expansion.

Our business strategy, in particular our production capacity expansion plans, is based on assumptions about future
demand for our products and on our ability to optimize utilization of our existing and future production facilities.
We cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our strategy of optimizing utilization of assets in
accordance with our plans or at all. For example, the frequency and length of facility maintenance and turnarounds
(scheduled outages of a production facility in order to perform necessary inspections, tests to comply with industry
regulations and any maintenance activities that may be necessary), planned restructurings and unplanned outages
have had, and may in the future have, an impact on our operating results. Furthermore, major capacity expansions
require long lead times in which operational business may be temporarily halted. Any failure to develop, revise
or implement our strategy in a timely and effective manner may adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

**_Seasonal fluctuations may impact our sales and cash flows._**

Our results of operations for the first and fourth quarters of the year are generally stronger than our results of
operation for the second and third quarters of the year, primarily due to seasonal factors in demand from our Crop
Science customers. We typically experience the strongest demand in the fourth quarter of the year and the first
quarter of the following year in line with increased demand for Crop Science products in the Northern Hemisphere
each spring prior to the growing season. Further, seasonal fluctuations including adverse weather conditions (heat,
cold, heavy rain, dryness, storm and exacerbated weather conditions due to climate change) may adversely affect
certain of our markets and customers. Elevated temperatures may lead to prolonged vegetation periods and
multiple harvests. Mild winters and strong humidity may lead to the increased spread of fungi, viruses and harmful
insects and thus crop yields may decrease and/or the use of pesticides may increase. For example, in early 2019
severe North American weather conditions led to a temporary downturn due to limited crop planting in that region
and in the summer of 2020, dry weather in Europe affected some of our customers, impacting demand.
Furthermore, droughts and dry weather conditions in Europe, North, Central and South America in 2022 impacted
the production of, amongst others, fruits, vegetables, soybeans and maize. In addition, most chemical production
companies, including certain of our suppliers and customers, generally schedule repairs of machinery and
production facility turnarounds (scheduled shutdowns of production units or facilities for maintenance) in the
summer months, which may result in lower sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth
quarters of a given year.

**_Our competitive position and future prospects depend on our senior management’s experience and expertise_**
**_and our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel._**

The unanticipated departure of any key member of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on
our business. In addition, because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance
is dependent on the continued service of, and on our ability to attract and retain, qualified management, scientific,
engineering, technical, marketing and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may
be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new
skilled personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

32


-----

**_We depend on good relations with our workforce, and any significant disruption could adversely affect us._**

For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we employed an average of approximately 1,200 employees in
our operations around the world. The countries in which we operate provide for various protections and rights for
employees, as well as collective bargaining agreements. These protections and rights may require us to invest
greater time and costs in amending employees’ terms of employment or make it more difficult to terminate
employment contracts. For example, certain employees in Germany and Finland are represented by trade unions
and works councils which generally must approve changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and
benefits. The employees of Jayhawk are also members of a union. Litigation by labor representatives, a labor
disturbance or work stoppage at any of our facilities as a result of any changes to our employment terms and
conditions or for any other reason could have a material adverse effect on that facility’s operations and, potentially,
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us against all potential losses to which we may be_**
**_subject, and it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms or at all._**

Due to the nature of the chemicals industry, our operations are generally difficult and expensive to insure. Our
production facilities, equipment and other assets are insured for property damage and business interruption risks.
However, our insurance does not cover mechanical equipment failure, and we may choose not to seek such
coverage in the future due to our assessment of the cost effectiveness of entering into such policies and the
possibility of mitigating such risks with spare parts or alternative sourcing options instead. We maintain liability,
property, directors’ and officers’ and other insurance coverage with coverage limits we consider adequate for the
size of our company and consistent with our business needs. However, we cannot be fully insured against all
potential hazards incident to our business, including losses resulting from global conflicts or terrorist acts, certain
natural catastrophes, environmental risks or other potential losses. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that
any claim under our insurance policies will be honored fully or timely, our insurance coverage will be sufficient
in any respect or our insurance premiums will not increase substantially. For example, after a fire incident at our
Pratteln site in 2020, affected our production output, our insurance policy premium for property damage and
business interruption more than doubled. We have experienced increases driven by inflation and other
macroeconomic developments and insurance premiums may significantly increase in the future as a result of
accidents of ours, other companies in Industrial Parks, or our competitors (which could be considered as industry
risk) or due to changing market conditions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully
insured, or if premiums for certain insurance policies might increase substantially in the future as a result of any
further incidents for which we are insured or as a result of general market forces, our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

**_Future acquisitions may prove difficult for us to complete and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits_**
**_from such acquisitions._**

We have a history of making and integrating acquisitions, such as our operations in Switzerland in 2007 (Pratteln),
Finland in 2011 (Kokkola) and in the USA in 2019 (Jayhawk). In the future we may acquire companies or assets
engaged businesses similar or complementary to ours. Restrictions in our existing financing agreements may
preclude us from or limit our ability to make certain acquisitions. See “⸺Risks Related to Our Financial
_Profile⸺We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take_
_other actions to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.”_

Further, we may use debt financing for any permitted acquisitions, which would increase our debt service
requirements. If making acquisitions or integrating any acquired business diverts too much management attention
from the existing operations, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and
cash flows.

Any acquisition that we make could be subject to a number of risks, including proposed acquisitions being
prohibited or subject to onerous conditions by certain antitrust or other regulatory laws; problems with effective
integration of operations; the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships; increased operating
costs; costs related to achieving or maintaining compliance with laws, rules or regulations; costs related to postclosing asset impairment charges and expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities; the loss of key
employees of the acquired company; exposure to unanticipated liabilities and unidentified loss contingencies; and
difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings. Integrating any future acquired business
may result in additional unforeseen difficulties or liabilities and could impact the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting.

33


-----

We cannot guarantee that any of our future acquisitions will ultimately provide the benefits we originally
anticipate, including the expected business growth opportunities, revenue benefits, cost synergies and other
operational efficiencies. Furthermore, we may not succeed in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or
financing and completing potential acquisitions on favorable terms. Any of the foregoing or other factors could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_We may fail to realize anticipated benefits from joint ventures._**

We have made, and may continue to make, investments and enter into joint ventures. For example, in 2014 we
established a joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd. (formerly Jining Jinwei Gold Power Co.,
Ltd.), a state-owned enterprise, to serve the market in Northern China and serve as a platform for further growth
in China. We have a 68 % interest in the joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical which contributes to less
than 1% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The success of joint ventures
or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable, and we may not realize our anticipated objectives or
benefits. Such arrangements may require significant initial expenditures as well as ongoing expenditures for
modernization and expansion. Furthermore, the ability to receive dividends, royalties and other payments from
joint ventures depends not only on the joint venture’s cash flows and profits, but also upon the terms of the joint
venture agreement with our partner. Conflicts with joint venture partners may lead to deadlock and may result in
our inability to pursue our desired strategy or exit from the joint venture on favorable terms. From time to time,
we may require the approval of a joint venture partner and any delay or difficulties in obtaining such approval
could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, sales or transfers of our interests in joint ventures may
be subject to the written approval of the joint venture partner, rights of first offer and, in the case of our joint
venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical, to the approval of certain Chinese regulatory authorities. Furthermore,
the bankruptcy, insolvency or severe financial distress of a joint venture partner or the joint venture itself or any
new regulations, international trade restrictions or enforcements to which they become subject could adversely
affect the joint venture and lead to its liquidation or a sale of our joint venture interest at a loss and, as a result,
could affect our reputation as well as our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_We may be subject to information technology systems failures, cyberattacks, network disruptions and breaches_**
**_of data security._**

Our information technology systems are an important element of effectively operating our business. Information
technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems, network disruptions and
breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to
protect customer or company information and our financial reporting, leading to increased costs. It is possible that
future technological developments could adversely affect the functionality of our computer systems and require
further action, which could require us to spend substantial funds to prevent or repair computer malfunctions.

Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages,
computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, including
cyberattacks, events such as fires, earthquakes, or floods and/or errors by our employees. Security vulnerabilities
in information technology solutions and insufficient contingency planning measures may lead to incidents that
affect the entire Group. As such threats, particularly around cybersecurity, continue to evolve we may be required
to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices and other protective
measures. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security, back-up
systems, cybersecurity insurance and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or
data security breach and/or the resulting loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, based on the EU Data and Digital Strategies, there are several initiatives pending and new laws
passed aimed at establishing a single, uniform digital European market with robust cybersecurity requirements,
including the Digital Services Act, the Data Act, the Directive EU 2022/2557 on the resilience of critical entities
(so-called NIS2 Directive), the Cyber Resilience Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act. Overall, implementing
and complying with these laws may lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices
in this respect. In addition, confidential information that we maintain may be subject to misappropriation, theft
and deliberate or unintentional misuse by current or former employees, third-party contractors or other parties.
Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in
breach of certain global data privacy, data protection, localization, security and consumer-protection laws and
regulations. In general, data privacy laws regulate when and how personal data of employees, customers or any
other third-party may be collected, for which purposes they may be processed and/or used, for how long they may
be stored and to whom and how they may be transferred. These laws and regulations are emerging and evolving

34


-----

in countries worldwide and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations in the European Union,
the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and changing. For example, we are subject to
the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (“GDPR”), under which we have compliance
obligations regarding the treatment (so-called processing) of personal data, including notification obligations of
personal data breaches and additional requirements for sharing personal data with any recipient outside the
European Economic Area. Furthermore, the GDPR inter alia requires the implementation of appropriate technical
and organizational measures to ensure the data security in general. Under the GDPR, breaches of data protection
rules may result in maximum fines equal to the greater of €20 million and 4% of the annual global turnover of the
group of the sanctioned company. It is possible that the GDPR and other laws may be interpreted or applied in a
manner that is adverse to us, unforeseen, or otherwise inconsistent with our practices or that we may not
adequately adapt our internal policies and/or procedures to evolving regulations, any of which could result in
litigation, regulatory investigations and potential legal liability, require us to change our practices in a manner
adverse to our business or limit access to our products and services in certain countries. As a result, our reputation
and brand may be harmed, we could incur substantial costs, and we could lose both customers and revenue.

Our failure to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in enforcement actions
against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by affected
individuals, the imposition of integrity obligations and agency oversight and damage to our reputation, any of
which could harm our business. Evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information,
within the European Union, the United States and elsewhere, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand
our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve sharing of personal data. Moreover, if the
relevant laws and regulations change, or are interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data
practices or if we expand into new markets and are required to comply with new requirements, we may need to
expend resources in order to change our business operations or data practices. Even the perception of privacy
concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may be required to increase our pension fund contributions._**

We have pension commitments to our existing and some of our former employees. These commitments are
partially covered by a pension scheme, pension funds, special purpose funds and insurance policies. As of
December 31, 2022, we have provisions for pensions and similar obligations in the amount of €18.1 million. The
amount of obligations is based on certain actuarial assumptions, including discount factors, life expectancy,
pension trends and future salary development as well as expected interest rates applicable to the applicable plan,
scheme or fund assets. If the actual results deviate from these assumptions, it could result in a considerable
increase of the pension commitments and thus to higher allocations to pension reserves in future years and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our tax burden could increase as a result of future tax audits and potential changes in applicable tax laws and_**
**_regulations._**

We are subject to routine tax audits by local tax authorities in the countries in which we operate. Future tax audits
may result in additional tax and interest payments, which would negatively affect our financial condition and
results of operation. Changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation of tax laws by the courts or the tax
authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business may also have negative consequences.
In addition, tax authorities may, to some extent, not accept the deductibility of interest payments, claiming among
other aspects, that limitation under interest ceiling rules or transfer pricing rules apply. In such event, we may face
additional tax payments becoming due in tax audits or in the process of tax assessments. Any additional tax
payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_We are exposed to currency fluctuation risks in several different countries that could adversely affect our_**
**_profitability._**

Our results of operations may be affected by transaction effects and translation effects of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations. We are exposed to transaction effects when one of our subsidiaries incurs costs or
generates sales in a currency different from its functional currency. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect
the relative competitive position of our production facilities, as well as our ability to market our products
successfully in other markets. We are exposed to currency fluctuations when we convert currencies we receive
for our products into currencies required to pay our debt or currencies used to purchase raw materials, meet our
fixed costs or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates.

35


-----

Certain of our sales are invoiced in currencies other than the euro, namely Swiss francs, Chinese yuan and U.S.
dollars, while our consolidated sales are reported in euro. If the value of the euro declines against currencies in
which our obligations are denominated or increases against currencies in which our sales are denominated, our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

**_We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from non-payment or non-performance by our customers._**

Our customers may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations.
These and other financial problems that may be experienced by our customers, as well as potential financial
weaknesses in our industry, may increase our risk in extending trade credit to customers. We have limited credit
risk insurance, which does not extend to protect us against all potential losses to which we may be subject. A
significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer’s financial position could cause us to limit
or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s
receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer, all of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Furthermore, should a customer choose to exercise a force majeure clause in their contract and refuse to tender
payment for our services, this would lead to increased storage and costs on our part or even losses or write-offs.
Conversely, we may exercise a force majeure clause in a business contract and the customer may successfully
challenge this exercise. All of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation._**

There has been increased focus by regulators, consumers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders, as well
as by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on environmental, social and governance matters
(“ESG”). This has resulted in expanding and increasingly complex mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence,
and disclosure on ESG topics. These developments and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and
related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions or investigations by various governmental and
regulatory agencies and increased litigation risk from private parties, may alter the environment in which we do
business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Any failure or perceived failure to meet our ESG commitments or targets, or loss of confidence, or inability to
meet expectations with our ESG commitments on the part of customers, investors, employees and other
stakeholders as it relates to our ESG initiatives could negatively impact our business relationships, and the demand
for our products. These impacts could be difficult and costly to overcome, even if such concerns were based on
inaccurate or misleading information.

In addition, achieving our ESG initiatives may result in increased costs in our supply chain, fulfillment, and/or
business operations. Standards regarding ESG initiatives could change and become more onerous for us to meet
successfully. Evolving data and research could undermine or refute our current claims and beliefs that we have
made in reliance on current research, which could also result in additional costs or a decrease in revenue, negative
market perception and increased scrutiny that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
condition.

A variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on such ESG topics, and the results of these
assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well
in such assessments is increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the
importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions. Topics taken into account in such assessments
include, among others, a company’s efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and
compliance with law and the role of a company’s board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues.
In light of investors’ increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues
successfully, or that we will successfully meet society’s ESG expectations or achieve our financial goals. As part
of our commitment to ESG matters, we have introduced specific, quantifiable key performance indicators. If we
fail to meet the targets of these or other key performance indicators to measure our progress towards our ESG
goals, we may suffer reputational damage, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**Risks Relating to Manufacturing**

**_Our operations are subject to hazards such as chemical spills, unforeseen shutdowns and natural catastrophes_**
**_which could result in significant disruptions and liability for us. We have experienced chemical spills in the_**
**_past and may continue to experience such events._**

The hazards and risks of disruption associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and
transportation of raw materials, products and wastes exist in our operations and the operations of other occupants
with whom we share manufacturing sites, including our suppliers. These potential risks of disruption include, but
are not necessarily limited to:

- unplanned production or power disruptions;

- failure of mechanical, process safety and pollution control equipment;

- pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures;

- explosions and fires;

- inclement weather and natural disasters (including earthquakes, the development of sinkholes and tornados);

- construction of national highways affecting our facilities;

- cyber-attacks and other external assaults on our IT-systems or digital infrastructure;

- terrorist attacks;

- political turmoil;

- chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases;

- exposure to toxic chemicals; and/or

- other accidents.

These interruptions and hazards could also lead to a short- or long-term suspension of operations, expose
employees, customers, the community and others to toxic chemicals and other hazards, contaminate the
environment, damage property, result in personal injury or death, damage our reputation and adversely affect the
productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business operations as a whole, and
result in the need for remediation, governmental enforcement, regulatory shutdowns, the imposition of
government fines and penalties and claims brought by governmental entities or third parties. In addition, the
occurrence of any such event could harm our ability to obtain or maintain our existing licenses or our key
commercial, regulatory, and governmental relationships. For example, in the past we have experienced chemical
spills and leakages in certain of our sites, including Kokkola and Pratteln. Furthermore, a part of our Pratteln site
sits in an area with increased risk of landslides and sinkholes, with one such sinkhole collapse event occurring in
2018. While we have made foundation improvements to our plants as part of investments to protect against
earthquakes and believe the risk to our operations is limited, unexpected natural disasters, including landslides
and sinkholes, may cause significant damage or delays in our plants.

Legal claims and regulatory actions could subject us to civil liability, administrative sanctions and criminal
penalties, which could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability. In many jurisdictions, such as the
United States, these risks are amplified by the frequency of class action lawsuits and high punitive damages
awards. Furthermore, our existing environmental, health and safety compliance and management systems set-up
to prevent potential risks, enable emergency responses and crisis management plans and mitigate damages may
not successfully prevent or mitigate these risks. Should any of these risks materialize, our production capacity
could be materially adversely affected, which could in turn negatively impact our sales and potentially lead to a
loss of market share. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

37


-----

**_We have experienced in the past and may continue to face unplanned production disruptions, manufacturing_**
**_interruptions and delays at our facilities worldwide._**

We currently have six manufacturing sites, four located in Europe, one in China and one in the United States. In
the ordinary course of business, we may face unplanned production disruptions due to unforeseen events such as
fires, power shortages, sabotage, accidents or natural catastrophes, resulting in significant operational disruptions,
delays, costs, or liability. For example, in 2020, a fire incident at our Pratteln site led to a partial standstill of the
chlorine value chain, which negatively impacted production and therefore sales of our products, negatively
affecting our revenue in 2020. In addition, in February 2021, our Jayhawk facility experienced a seven-day
standstill due to a severe winter storm. As a result, we incurred substantial costs and expenses due to this standstill.
Some of the crucial equipment, infrastructure systems and storage systems used within our various plants (for
example: incineration boilers, mixer settlers, reactors or utility infrastructure systems) may also experience
damages, decreased quality in terms of functionality or restraints due to either unforeseen events or normal wear
and tear. Although we possess customary insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business,
and, for example, we were able to claim back certain losses from the fire incident at our Pratteln site, such plans
and insurance may not cover all such disasters or be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not
continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, such disruptions could impact our
relationships with our clients, all of which could have a negative impact on our business.

Additionally, adverse weather or other natural catastrophes such as flooding, severe storms, landslides,
earthquakes or others, whether caused by climate change or natural processes of the earth, may significantly affect
our production sites and cause severe disruptions and some of our production facilities worldwide may be more
exposed to such risks. For example, a past geological survey conducted at our Pratteln site in Switzerland, revealed
that the site is subject to seismic activity and earthquake risk. We have already explored and initiated a seismic
retrofitting process which, however, is envisaged to take several years for completion.

If disruptions occur, alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost
substantially more or it may take significant time to start production. Each of these scenarios could materially
adversely affect our business and financial performance. If any of our production facilities is unable to
manufacture our products for an extended period of time, our sales may decline due to the disruption and we may
not be able to manufacture sufficient volumes of products to meet our customers’ needs.

Furthermore, our production processes and supply chains are highly integrated and any disruptions to such
production processes or supply chains may negatively impact the sales of our products. For example, the fire
accident at our Pratteln site in 2020 affected not only our products used in the Crop Science and Life Science
industries but also, as a result of our integrated production network, our products which are used in the Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals industry. As the production of one of the key chemicals manufactured at the
Pratteln site depends on monochloroacetic acid (MCA) sourced from our Knapsack and Gersthofen facilities, we
lost volumes of MCA during the outage due to the reduced demand at Pratteln while production capacity was
down. Furthermore, we may face work-related accidents and near-misses on part of the employees and workers
in our plants.

Although we believe we maintain disaster recovery plans in line with customary industry standards and possess
customary insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, such plans
and insurance may not cover all such disasters or be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not
continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any inability to recover from a third-party any or all
compensation related to a disruption could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, any inability to
meet our customers’ needs could cause them to seek other suppliers. Furthermore, to the extent a disruption occurs
at a production facility that has been operating at or near full capacity, the resulting shortage of our product could
be particularly harmful because production at the facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the
disruption. Shutdowns, strikes, weather or other disruptions affecting our upstream supply chain or our utilities or
logistics providers, could have a negative impact on our business. Any such disruptions and the resulting
repercussions may adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_We rely on third parties for the performance of transportation and logistical services._**

We rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our business, particularly the receipt of raw
materials from our suppliers and the transport and distribution of our products to our customers as well as certain
services related to waste disposal. Our ability to receive vital raw materials, to provide our products to our
customers and to dispose of our waste depends on our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with third parties,

38


-----

including railroad, trucking and shipping companies. To the extent that our third-party service providers increase
their rates, including to reflect higher fuel, maintenance, labor or other costs due to increased regulation, taxation
or otherwise, we may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers in a timely manner or at all.

In certain instances, we depend on a single or limited number of third-party service providers, including for our
chlorine supply in Knapsack or certain waste disposal services across the Group. Any disruption to our third-party
service providers may lead to standstills or otherwise negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products
(due to a lack of, for example, raw materials and energy supply (e.g. steam)), to deliver our products to our
customers or to continue our operations in the event we cannot find any alternative provider, in particular if the
availability of a particular type of service provider is limited or if we depend on only one provider. Any material
increases in our transport and distribution costs that we are unable to pass on to customers or any disruption to
our transportation and logistical network, including waste disposal, could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operation or cash flows. For example, transportation routes between cities in
Germany and Switzerland have limited capacity and if there is no alternative container or tank wagon that can
transport products to and from our sites, our customers would fail to receive their ordered products or our own
production sites would fail to receive the raw materials. Inability to deliver ordered products to customers may
also lead to additional unpredicted costs for storage. Some of the chemicals we transport also face transportation
and loading restrictions – for example, certain of our materials are not approved by authorities for transportation
by vehicular means, which further limits the number of alternative transportation means available. Furthermore,
our suppliers in China have faced the risk of unexpected delivery delays as a result of China’s zero-COVID policy
and may face in the future the risk of similar political measures in which the detection of a single case of COVID19 may lead to the shut-down of an entire port. See “⸺Risks Related to the Industry in which We Operate⸺The
_spread of the 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has had, and the outbreak of another infectious disease or other_
_serious public health concern around the world could have, a negative impact on economies, financial markets_
_and business activities.”_

Future disruptions of this nature may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operation or cash flows.

**_We may face capacity constraints that could compromise our ability to meet customer expectations or_**
**_overcapacity that could negatively impact our results._**

If we encounter capacity limitations or fail to effectively manage our capacity, our business could suffer either as
a result of not meeting customer expectations (e.g., inability to meet agreed delivery deadlines) or having to
decline potential new business opportunities. Conversely, if we are not able to effectively manage our capacity or
there is a decline in customer demand, and, as a result, we experience underutilization of certain sites, this could
lead to overcapacity and result in profit margin erosion due to the high fixed costs of our manufacturing sites.
Currently, certain of our facilities are operating at high capacity. Any disruptions in the manufacturing of
chemicals at these sites, including due to capacity constraints, could impact our ability to fulfill the respective
customer manufacturing contracts.

In addition, the volume of manufacturing for different chemicals varies across our sites, with some sites having
certain focuses and specialties. Thus, if there is increased demand in a certain manufactured chemical, we may
experience over-capacity at select manufacturing sites, while other sites operate at less efficient levels. In some
cases, we may not be able to easily or quickly shift production between sites employing the same methodology or
technology due to the specific manufacturing requirements of our customers’ customized products (including
regulatory requirements). As a result, we may face significant challenges in managing our capacity. If we are
unable to manage effectively or optimally our capacity in light of changing customer requirements, which can
vary and shift across the quarters of the financial year, we may experience operational inefficiencies and site
underutilization or need to reduce the volumes of more profitable products to manufacture contractually
committed volumes of other products.

Furthermore, such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or
renovation. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.

39


-----

**_We are dependent on the availability of raw materials and any shortages, lack of delivery or price increases_**
**_may lead to manufacturing interruptions and/or increases in manufacturing costs, and may also limit our_**
**_ability to grow our business._**

We produce a certain amount of raw materials ourselves, however, we also procure raw materials from third
parties. As such, our manufacturing processes are dependent on the availability of various raw materials,
including, inter alia, acetic acid, other carboxylic acids, acetic acid anhydride, lactic acid derivatives, chlorine in
sites where we do not produce it ourselves, and various solvents and catalysts.

While we rely on a number of third-party suppliers to provide us with raw materials and supplies, it is possible
that any of our third-party suppliers could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements, import or export
restrictions, natural disasters, international supply disruptions, geopolitical issues, strikes, shortages, financial,
operational or quality issues at a supplier’s facilities and other events or could be terminated in the future. Our
third-party suppliers may close production sites causing supply chain problems and any decision by our suppliers
to fail to deliver certain materials in part or at all may negatively impact our business. In addition, our third-party
suppliers may deliver defective raw materials that fall out of the agreed specifications in which case such raw
materials would be returned. For example, macroeconomic developments or other events such as the RussiaUkraine conflict may negatively impact raw material supply chains, affecting the availability of raw materials
needed for our production or used by our customers. As a result of any of these factors, we may be unable to
source input products from other suppliers upon short notice and/or at the required volume. Any such delay or
failure of delivery by our suppliers could result in delaying our customers’ production schedule, which could
result in loss of business and reputational damage. See “⸺Risks Related to the Industry in Which We
_Operate⸺Economic downturns or worsening global economic conditions may adversely impact our business,_
_financial condition, results of operation and cash flows” and “⸺The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting_
_sanctions and measures taken against Russia have had and may have further adverse material effects on the_
_global economy, energy supplies and prices, and may have severe adverse effects on the operations of energy-_
_intensive sectors (e.g., heavy industry, chemical manufacturers, metallurgy, pharma, etc.).”_

In certain instances, for example where the supply of raw materials to our production site requires a specific
infrastructure such as a pipeline, we may also depend on a single supplier. For example, our plants in Knapsack
and Jining depend on adjacent suppliers to supply chlorine via a pipeline. Furthermore, at our Gersthofen and
Pratteln sites, we rely on a single third-party supplier for salt. Any lack of availability suppliers could have
detrimental effects on our production capacity at such sites. See “⸺We rely on third parties for the performance
_of transportation and logistical services” and “⸺Risks Related to the Industry in Which We Operate⸺The spread_
_of the 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has had, and the outbreak of another infectious disease or other serious_
_public health concern around the world could have, a negative impact on economies, financial markets and_
_business activities.”_

We have historically been able to partially pass on increases in raw materials costs to our customers when the
prices for the purchase of raw materials increased, for example, through raw material price adjustment clauses in
some of our agreements and corresponding price annexes. In certain instances, we also partially pass on
transportation, energy and packaging costs to our customers. However, there is a risk that we will not always be
able to do so in the future and any significant and/or unexpected increases in the cost of raw materials or
transportation costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers (at least in part) or that lead to a significant
increase of costs in business relationships based on contracts that do not contain adjustment mechanisms could
have a negative impact on our financial results. Furthermore, even if we continue to pass on a portion of the cost
of raw materials and transportation costs to our customers, the cost of such raw materials and/or transportation
costs may increase to a significantly higher price such that customers would seek other suppliers.

In addition, several of our raw materials suppliers are based in China and any changes to the environmental, health
and safety laws and regulations in this region will likely impact certain chemical sites, including those of our
third-party suppliers. Such changes could result in increased costs of such raw materials, delay in the production
of such raw materials and, in turn, could impact our supply chain and our ability to meet our own chemical product
delivery timelines. See “⸺Risks Related to Our Business⸺We are exposed to risks related to conducting
_operations in several different countries.” On the other hand, we may also experience challenges in managing our_
inventory due to, inter alia, customer order cancellations or inaccurate manufacturing forecasts. Any inability to
manage our inventory levels could result in such inventory becoming obsolete, resulting in write-downs of certain
purchased raw materials and supplies. Any change in inventories, whether an increase or decrease, affects our
cash flow and other financial results.

40


-----

These challenges may become even more significant as we endeavor to expand our business, requiring additional
and new raw materials. Decisions to expand capacity may be delayed due to sourcing and supply chain problems.
In addition to these risks, governmental regulations, environmental laws and regulations, increasing demand for
raw materials from competitors and the effects of third-party supplier consolidation may also lead to temporary
or permanent shortages of raw materials.

Any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate raw materials and/or supplies or significant price increase
of such materials and/or supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.

**_Increased energy costs, disruptions in energy supplies or our inability to pass on energy costs could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

Our business is dependent on the steady supply of significant amounts of energy, in particular electricity for our
electrolysis production processes in Pratteln and Knapsack. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, our
energy costs recognized in cost of sales amounted to €65.6 million, or 8.7% of our revenue. Energy costs are
affected by various factors, including the availability of supplies of particular sources of energy, energy prices
and regulatory decisions.

In particular, prices for oil, gas and electricity have been volatile in recent years, and such volatility may continue
as a result of geopolitical instability, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In addition, electricity prices for
industrial consumers in Germany and Switzerland are generally higher than in several neighboring countries. Any
significant increase in market prices, transportation costs, grid fees or taxes (including by reduction of tax benefits)
associated with the supply of energy would increase our operating costs and, thus, may negatively affect our
results of operations if we are not able to pass a certain portion of the increased costs on to our customers. Any
deficiencies in our contracts with our customers or our suppliers, such as a misstatement or misapplication of a
price formula, any disagreement with respect to the interpretation of a price formula or other unforeseen events,
such as increasing energy prices, could result in an increase in our energy costs and could result in an inability to
pass on increases in energy costs to our customers.

In addition, any significant disruption in our energy supply at any of our facilities as a result of outages, stoppages,
supply chain issues, regulators or public authorities requesting reduction in energy consumption as a result of
supply issues or other reasons, could impact our supply chain and our ability to fulfill our customer manufacturing
contracts.

Any inability or delay in passing on increases in energy costs to our customers or any interruption or shortage of
energy supply from our suppliers may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

**Risks Relating to Environmental and Regulatory Matters**

**_Compliance with increasing regulatory requirements concerning the testing, labelling, registration and safety_**
**_analysis of our products may result in significant additional costs for us or may reduce or eliminate the_**
**_availability and/or marketability of some of the raw materials we use or of our products. Our inability to_**
**_maintain our existing classification registration in member states of the European Union under the REACH_**
**_legislation, or comparable legislation in other countries in which we operate or do business, may affect our_**
**_ability to manufacture and sell certain products._**

To operate a chemical manufacturing business and to sell and distribute chemical products involves safety health
and environmental risks. As part of our business, we store, handle, transport and use certain substances or
components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. If operational risks - such as fires, leaks, releases and
explosions - materialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment or loss of production.

We must comply with a broad range of regulations related to the testing, manufacturing, registration, labeling and
safety analysis of our products or the products of our suppliers. In some countries, including the Member States
of the European Union (particularly Finland and Germany), Switzerland, the United States and China, these types
of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and we expect this trend to continue.

For example, our products and raw materials produced or imported into the European Union are subject to
extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analysis of the
substances contained in them. The European Union Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization

41


-----

of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006), (“REACH”), imposes significant obligations on the chemicals
industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of basic chemicals and
more advanced chemicals. The review and update of existing registrations is expensive and time-consuming and
lead to increased production costs and reduced operating margins for chemical products. We also cannot exclude
with certainty that the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) may not designate some of our other products as
substances of very high concern (“SVHCs”) and thereby require authorization and a strict safety evaluation for
them under REACH.

ECHA is also responsible to evaluate potential restrictions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFASs”) that
have been proposed by the Member States. PFASs are a large class of thousands of synthetic chemicals that are
used throughout society. They are increasingly detected as environmental pollutants and some are linked to
negative effects on human health. PFASs have been frequently observed to contaminate groundwater, surface
water and soil. A number of PFASs are already on the REACH candidate list of SVHCs, for example
perfluorinated carboxylic acids (C9-14 PFCAs) and PFHxS. On January 13, 2023, a proposal prepared by the
competent national authorities of, inter alia, Denmark, Germany and Sweden to restrict around 10,000 PFASs
was submitted to ECHA. All PFASs in the scope of the proposal are very persistent in the environment and the
national authorities estimate that around 4.4 million tonnes of PFASs would end up in the environment over the
next 30 years unless action is taken. ECHA’s scientific committees are currently evaluating the proposal. The
evaluation will also take into consideration the results and the input from a six-month public consultation that
started on March 22, 2023. Afterwards, ECHA’s scientific committees will adopt formal opinions, based on which
the European Commission and the Member States will then decide on the potential restrictions. We cannot exclude
that the proposed restrictions of the use of PFASs may have a negative impact on our business activities.

Moreover, under the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012 we have to apply for approval of active
substances at ECHA and for product authorization before placing a biocidal product on the market. In connection
with REACH or the EU Classification, Labeling and Packaging Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008)
(“CLP”), some key raw materials, chemicals or substances, including our products, could be reclassified as having
a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, on users of our products, or on our employees.

Furthermore, the European Directive No. 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions (“IED Directive”) sets out rules on
the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities and includes rules aimed at reducing emissions
into air, water and land, as well as preventing the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall
environmental protection. Although the IED Directive and its implementation provide transitional provisions,
once a new industry standard becomes binding, existing permits, which are not in compliance with such standard
can become invalid. We have in the past incurred, and will in the future incur, significant cost for capital and
operating expenditures to obtain and maintain necessary permits.

In the European Union, the “European Green Deal”, a strategy aiming at making Europe the first climate-neutral
continent by 2050, will have a considerable impact on the industry throughout all sectors, including on our
business. The implementation of the “European Green Deal” involves revisions of a large number of regulations,
including REACH, CLP and the IED Directive. The “European Green Deal” is still in the process of being
implemented, with many bills in the legislative process, and the impact on our business cannot yet be predicted in
detail. However, we will be facing a stricter regulatory framework in many respects going forward.

In addition, the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) mandates that the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) conduct safety evaluations for all chemicals in active commerce and determine that
new chemicals and significant new uses of chemicals are not likely to present an unreasonable risk before entering
the market. With respect to any facilities we operate or may operate in the United States and with respect to any
products we sell or may in the future sell in the United States, classification or reclassification of one or more of
our raw materials or products could affect our ability to manufacture or market our products, result in a ban on
purchase or sale of our products or raw materials or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification,
labelling, handling, or other requirements.

Furthermore, all pesticide products sold in the United States must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide
and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), and most must be registered with the U.S. EPA and similar state agencies. Our
inability to obtain or maintain such registrations, or the cancellation of any such registration of our products, could
have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on a variety of factors, including the
product(s) involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly
affected. We attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute
active ingredients, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid or reduce these risks.

42


-----

In Germany, applicable environmental laws include, for example, air emissions laws (Immissionsschutzrecht),
soil protection laws (Bodenschutzrecht), water protection laws (Gewässerschutzrecht), waste laws (Abfallrecht)
and plant safety laws (Anlagensicherheitsrecht). In the past, we have incurred costs and expenses due to exceeding
volatile organic compound (VOC) emission thresholds. We also continue to incur costs and expenses in relation
to waste water disposal and certain rehabilitation measures required under applicable laws. However, such future
costs and expenses are difficult to predict.

These and other regulatory requirements affecting our products that have been adopted or may be adopted in the
future could negatively affect the availability, marketability, transportation flexibility or disposability (including
quantity of disposability) of the raw materials or products we use, result in a restriction or ban on their purchase
or sale, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification labelling, handling or storage capacity
requirements. Because some of these regulations have only recently been enacted or proposed, we are not in a
position to predict with certainty their expected cost impact with specificity. In addition, as some of our products
are sold into markets in which the correct classification is at the discretion of the legal regime applicable to those
substances, we cannot exclude that competent authorities or third parties could question or contest our
classification. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_We may face additional liabilities and may incur significant costs related to contamination from hazardous_**
**_substances or residual pollution._**

We have to comply with stringent procedures governing handling, storing and disposal of hazardous substances
and wastes, and comply with rules on soil and groundwater contamination, and employee health and safety of
which historically we have experienced violations and citations. We are also subject to laws and regulations
governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and non-compliant products, the handling of regulated
materials included in our products, and the disposal of our products or their components (including capacity limits
of disposed waste) at the end of their useful lives. We also cannot assure that we will dispose of our internal waste
in a cost-effective manner. This can require significant expenditures and non-compliance may result in the
limitation or suspension of manufacturing or subject us to stricter regulation, prohibition to use such substances,
material monetary fines and penalties, civil or criminal sanctions, or other liabilities.

In the past we have experienced several environmental incidents at our various manufacturing sites that have
required certain clean-up efforts. In each case, the local sites were in contact with the respective authorities, and
the matters have been closed without further action or remediation required although continuous monitoring is
required in certain cases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve any further issues of a similar
or differing nature in the same manner or that future incidents will not require significant remediation.

Contamination or residual pollution at any formerly owned or operated properties can also result in liability. In
the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at third-party
locations, including facilities we formerly owned or operated, the issuance of additional requirements with respect
to existing contamination or residual pollution, or the imposition of other clean-up obligations for which we are
responsible, we may be required to take additional, unplanned remedial measures for which we have not recorded
reserves.

Furthermore, environmental laws may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, and
some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for releases of hazardous substances into the
environment, which could result in liability for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault.
Furthermore, regulators might ban or restrict the usage of some of our products or their respective ingredients or
substances in the future. See “⸺Risks Related to the Industry in Which We Operate⸺We are subject to stringent
_environmental, health and safety laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions. We are highly regulated and_
_may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with, or address liabilities under, environmental, health and_
_safety laws and regulations applicable to our business.”_

Should any of the above factors occur, this may result in an increase in our costs and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We have experienced chemical spillages in the past which may be harmful to human health and operate on_**
**_sites which contain legacy pollution and contamination. We may be liable for damages, site remediation or_**
**_other environmental and health-related matters._**

Some of our production sites have a long history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related activities,
including the processing of harmful materials and we have experienced chemical spillages and leakages in the
past. Many of our production sites sit on top of contaminated soil. For example, plots of land on the Pratteln site
are partially located on contaminated sites which are registered in the Swiss cantonal cadastre of polluted sites.
Due to industrial use in the past, such plots of land partially contain contaminated soil, for example, low amounts
(in most cases) of metolachlor, lead, cadmium, zinc, nickel and mercury. According to section 36 of
Umweltschutzgesetz Basel-Landschaft (USG BL), we must examine, treat and dispose of contaminated soil in a
proper way before commencing construction. We currently remain compliant with this regulation.

The Jayhawk site in Kansas is subject to a Consent Agreement entered into in June 1999 between several
respondents and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (“KDHE”) in which the respondents did not
admit liability for the contamination of the Jayhawk plant (previously used by the former Gulf Oil Chemical
Company, among others) but agreed to perform certain remedial efforts. In 2006, a “Perimeter Monitoring
Program” was established to monitor the site for residual anthropogenic releases that could be related to historical
facility operations and to achieve the site monitoring objectives requested by the KDHE. Compounds historically
associated with the Jayhawk site include nitrates, VOCs and perchlorate. The KDHE accepted this risk-based
perimeter monitoring approach with no additional investigation or remediation required at the Jayhawk site as
long as the receptors (the relevant bodies of water) remain unimpacted (in accordance with appropriate regulatory
standards).

Most of our sites are also located on so-called “Industrial Parks”. Such Industrial Parks are operated by the
respective owner of each plot of land, who provides a regular environmental soil assessment of the land to the
companies located thereon (one of which is us) and who are responsible for the environmental management of the
residual pollution. Our Knapsack and Gersthofen facilities are located in Industrial Parks that contain historic
residual soil contamination.

As such, we may incur significant additional monitoring and/or clean-up costs as a result of additional
contamination discovered, additional contamination due to a natural disaster event or additional remedial
obligations imposed in the future. Moreover, we may also be jointly and severally liable for environmental and
health-related damages caused by one or more of our legal predecessors or related to assets acquired by us or
them, regardless of fault. Such discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new
obligations to investigate or remediate soil or groundwater contamination, at our facilities could result in
substantial unanticipated costs to us. In addition, operators of Industrial Parks are also responsible for its
infrastructure, for example, maintenance of energy supply infrastructure (e.g., electrical lines) or retention basins
for waste water, which are used by all companies located thereon. Any disruptions of an Industrial Park’s
infrastructure might affect our operations. Similarly, we might be exposed to incidents at neighboring companies
beyond our control at Industrial Parks which might lead to temporary interruptions of our business operations,
such as, for example, outages in our steam supply or the timely implementation of a new wastewater treatment
facility in Pratteln through an outsourcing solution which is required by Swiss authorities. See “⸺Risks Related
_to the Industry in Which We Operate⸺We are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety laws and_
_regulations across multiple jurisdictions. We are highly regulated and may incur significant costs to maintain_
_compliance with, or address liabilities under, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable_
_to our business.”_

Should any of the above factors occur, this may result in an increase in our costs and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

At the international level, the Paris Agreement is the first agreement that includes an obligation to keep the global
temperature within a specific range, namely “well below” 2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to
pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since the entry into force of
this Agreement in late 2016, and with the recent increase of natural disasters, governmental efforts to tackle

44


-----

climate change have grown globally. This goes hand in hand with the adoption of climate change legislation,
relating in particular to greenhouse gas emissions and energy use and consumption. Given that the actions
envisaged so far by the signatory states to the Paris Agreement were considered not to be sufficient at the last
Conference of the Parties in November 2022, we expect that further legislation will be adopted and existing
legislation will become more stringent over the next years.

In the European Union, numerous pieces of legislation will be revised in the course of the implementation of the
“EU Green Deal” and the “Fit-for-55” package, which will impose additional obligations on us, in particular
relating to greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency.

In the European Union, regulations attempt to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to establish a mechanism
for trading in carbon dioxide emission allowances. The EU Emission Trading System (“EU ETS”) imposes an
EU-wide emissions cap applying to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be emitted by in-scope
operations and provides for the trade with allowances for such emissions. Operators can buy allowances when
they are put on the market by EU member states via auctions or on the secondary market. Certain sectors, in
relation to which the EU sees a risk that operators would relocate their production site outside the EU where they
obliged to buy allowances, can to a certain extent benefit from free allocation. In recent discussions to revise the
EU ETS, the relevant EU institutions agreed however, that, for a number of sectors free allocation will be phased
out gradually over the coming years. Instead, those sectors will be subject to the Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism. This means that EU manufacturers will need to buy allowances for their emissions, but that importers
from outside the EU will likewise need to buy carbon certificates, corresponding to the carbon price that they
would have paid if they had manufactured the products in the EU. Under the currently applicable ETS, the EUwide emissions cap is lowered annually by a linear factor of 1.74% of the average annual total quantity of emission
allowances issued in the EU in the second trading period. In the recent discussions to revise the EU ETS, the
relevant EU institutions agreed on a one-off reduction of the EU-wide quantity of allowances by 90 million in
2024 and by 27 million in 2026 respectively and on an annual reduction of the overall cap by 4.3% from 2024 to
27 and by 4.4% from 2028 to 2030.

Although we have not been required to date to acquire emission allowances for our covered operations, as the
amount of our emissions does not exceed the thresholds that cause the applicability of the ETS, we cannot predict
with certainty whether those thresholds may be decreased and/or what applicable thresholds in the future may be.
If we were required in the future to purchase emission allowances in the amount required for our production
purposes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows. Furthermore, as a result of these changes in regulation, there have been several social movements in
Europe (for example the Farm to Fork Strategy) encouraging restaurants to source their ingredients from local
farms or encourage consumers to eat only locally grown foods. Such trends could potentially lead to a decrease
in demand for herbicides and pesticides which could ultimately adversely impact our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

In the United States, the EPA is engaged in ongoing GHG rulemaking. In light of legislative and judicial
challenges to EPA action, significant uncertainty currently exists as to how GHG regulations will in the future
impact large stationary sources, including any facilities we operate or in the future may operate in the U.S., and
what costs or operational changes these regulations may require. In August 2022, the U.S. Congress passed, and
President Biden signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which appropriates significant federal
funding for renewable energy initiatives and, for the first time ever, imposes a fee on methane emissions from
certain facilities. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions
of GHGs. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a significant number of U.S. states have taken legal
measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, including through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or
regional GHG gas cap-and-trade programs. It is difficult to predict the form for such regulation that the U.S.
Congress or U.S. states may adopt in the future (e.g., a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions
tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect
of such requirements. For example, with respect to facilities we operate or may operate in the United States, we
could be required to install emissions control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer and manage
our GHG emissions program, or address other regulatory obligations, which may adversely impact our operations,
financial condition and cash flows. Additional future regulation of GHGs in the United States could result from
future international treaty obligations, regulatory changes under the CAA or other existing legislation, or federal,
state or regional adoption of GHG regulatory schemes. For example, in March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules
relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related data risks and opportunities, including financial impacts,
physical and transition risks, related governance and strategy and GHG emissions, for certain public companies.
We are currently assessing this rule but at this time we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the rule on our
business or those of our customers.

45


-----

In Switzerland, following the rejection of a proposed revision of the CO2 Act (Bundesgesetz über die Reduktion
_der CO2-Emissionen, CO2-Gesetz) in a popular referendum in June 2021, the Swiss Federal Council has_
published a new proposal for a revised CO2 Act in September 2022. However, such revision has yet to pass
parliament and, potentially, a popular referendum. In the interim, the CO2 Act has been updated to align the
reduction target with Switzerland’s international commitments until 2024 and extend certain emissions reduction
instruments which would otherwise have expired. In particular, the Swiss emissions trading system continues to
apply with the aforementioned update ensuring that emissions reduction certificates not used in 2021 can be
transferred to the time period 2022 to 2024. In addition, the Swiss emissions trading system is linked to that of
the EU since January 2020. An increase of prices due to reduced number of emissions allowances issued will
therefore also impact Swiss participants having to acquire emission allowances. Furthermore, modifications to the
Swiss emissions trading systems following those of the EU are currently being evaluated. We are currently
assessing the developments around the CO2 Act and potential modifications to the Swiss emissions trading
systems but at this time we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the rule on our business or those of our customers.

**_If our customers are not able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of their_**
**_products which use our chemical products, this could restrict our ability to sell those products to certain_**
**_customers._**

Within Europe and the United States, the regulatory environment may be impacted by the activities of nongovernmental organizations and special interest groups and stakeholder reaction to actual or perceived impacts of
new and existing technology, products or processes on safety, health and the environment. Obtaining and
maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may
require participation from technology providers. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously
changing. In addition, in recent years within the United States and the European Union, there has been an increase
in the number of lawsuits filed by those who identify themselves as public or environmental interest groups
seeking to invalidate pesticide product registrations and/or challenge the way federal or state governmental entities
apply the rules and regulations governing pesticide produce use. Even though the general predicted trend is in
favor of greener agrochemical products, non-environmentally friendly pesticide products associated with older
registrations face the increased risk of social and legal challenges, for example, export restrictions on nonregistered products as imposed by the European Union and Switzerland. If in the future there is any unintended
regulatory non-compliance by certain of our key customers, this could negatively impact our business and
operations. Responding to any potential regulatory changes and meeting existing and new requirements may
involve significant costs for certain customers or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice
which could ultimately result in our reduced profitability. Failure to receive necessary permits or approvals by our
customers could have near- and long-term effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.

**Risks Relating to Legal Matters**

**_We require various licenses and permits to operate our business._**

We require various licenses and permits in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These licenses and permits are
generally subject to conditions stipulated in the licenses and permits and/or relevant laws or regulations under
which such licenses and permits are issued. While we constantly monitor and ensure our compliance with such
conditions, any actual or alleged failure to comply with the stipulated conditions could result in the revocation,
suspension or non-renewal of the relevant license or permit, or penalties and/or fines. Should there be any
revocation, rejection or delay in the issuance of any of the licenses and permits we need, or the failure to obtain
or procure any necessary licenses and permits, we may not be able to carry out our operations in the relevant
jurisdiction or we may face materially increased costs in our operations so as to find an alternative solution.

For example, we are exposed to risks associated with approvals when building and operating production facilities.
Relevant regulatory authorities may not grant licenses, approvals, certifications, exemptions and exceptions as
quickly as anticipated, which may result in project delays or unused capacities. Any of the foregoing could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We are subject to risks related to subsidies under the StromNEV and similar laws._**

Our German sites currently benefit each from an arrangement on individual network tariffs with the responsible
network operator pursuant to the Electricity Network Tariff Regulation Ordinance (Stromnetzentgeltverordnung,
“StromNEV”) which allows reductions of the regular network tariffs for undertakings with high electricity
consumption. If the consumption related thresholds are not met by the relevant site in a calendar year, the

46


-----

difference to the regular network tariff must be paid to the network operator for such calendar year retroactively.
Therefore, it remains uncertain whether we may have to pay the difference to the full network tariff retroactively
or whether the eligibility criteria may be amended in the future, which could result in a partial loss of the individual
network tariffs and, consequently, additional expenses. As we operate sites in six countries, we might be exposed
to similar risks in the other countries we operate which would adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our confidentiality agreements may not protect our know-how._**

The production process for chemicals is complex and requires significant technical expertise. We rely upon
unpatented processes and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our
competitive position. While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third
parties to protect our and our customers’ intellectual property, there can be no assurances that our confidentiality
agreements will not be breached or that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or knowhow, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these trade
secrets and know-how. Moreover, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade
secrets and know-how through independent development or other access by legal means, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.

**_If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it may be costly and time-consuming,_**
**_and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation could harm our business and reputation._**

We cannot assure you that our activities will not, unintentionally or otherwise, infringe on the patents or other
intellectual property rights owned by others. We may spend significant time and effort and incur significant
litigation costs if we are required to defend ourselves against intellectual property rights claims brought against
us, regardless of whether the claims have merit, and such claims and defense may require significant management
time and attention that would otherwise be devoted to our business operations. If we are found to have infringed
on the patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to substantial claims for damages,
which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may also be required to cease development, use or sale of the relevant products or processes, or we may be
required to obtain a license on the disputed rights, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms,
if at all. The involvement in any process for alleged infringement of intellectual property, regardless of whether
the claims have merit, may harm our business and reputation.

**_We must comply with foreign trade laws, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-trust, anti-money laundering and anti-_**
**_corruption laws across the jurisdictions in which we operate._**

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-trust, anti-money laundering laws and economic sanctions
programs in all jurisdictions in which we operate, including such laws and regulations imposed by the European
Union, the United States and the United Nations (in each case to the extent applicable). In particular, our
international operations expose us to potential liability under the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977, any law, rule or regulation promulgated to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development’s (“OECD”) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
Business Transactions, signed 17 December 1997, and other similar laws and regulations relating to anticorruption, the anti-boycott regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of
Antiboycott Compliance and economic sanction programs administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office
of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and corresponding regimes administered by the European Union. Economic
sanctions programs do and will continue to restrict the Group’s ability to engage in business dealings with certain
sanctioned countries.

There is no certainty that our employees, representatives and agents will comply with all applicable laws and
regulations, particularly given the complexity of these laws and the potential corporate structure of customers.
Some of the international locations in which we operate, in particular China, have legal systems different from
those in our home jurisdictions and some may have higher than normal levels of corruption. As a result, there can
be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us or our employees, representatives and
agents from violating these laws and regulations in every transaction in which we may engage.

Furthermore, it is possible that certain foreign trade policies may be construed or applied in a manner that is
adverse to us, unforeseen, or otherwise inconsistent with our practices. Non-compliance with foreign trade laws
may lead to fines, penalties, substantial reputational damage as well as the overall or partial shut-down of our

47


-----

shipping activities which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Any failure to effectively prevent, identify or address breaches of our legal obligations as a result of inadequate
internal controls, compliance management and risk management systems could result in administrative, civil and
criminal sanctions, the assertion of damages claims by third parties and reputational damage, each of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We do not have any direct revenue exposure to Russia or Ukraine; however, we are aware that some of our
customers subsequently distribute our products or incorporate our products into the production of their goods
which, in certain circumstances, are distributed, and may continue to be distributed in the future, into Russia or
Ukraine in reliance upon exemptions from sanctions in the crop protection and pharmaceuticals markets.
However, the continued military incursion by Russia into Ukraine (beginning in February 2022) could adversely
impact macroeconomic conditions, give rise to regional instability and result in heightened economic sanctions
from the United States and the international community in a manner that could adversely affect our operations in
the broader Western European region, including to the extent that any such sanctions restrict our ability to conduct
business internationally, develop future opportunities and/or to utilize certain banking systems at our election.
Although historically we have not conducted operations in Russia or in Ukraine and we have not derived a material
amount of revenue from operations in such jurisdictions, further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a
broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, including Europe, the United States and
Asia Pacific, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings, including litigation related expenses and/or_**
**_reputational damage, among other losses, which could harm our business._**

From time to time, we are involved in litigation and other tax, labor, settlement and legal proceedings. We cannot
predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other
proceedings that may be filed by or against us, including remedies, settlement amounts or damage awards, and
adverse results in any litigation and other proceedings may materially harm our business. Litigation and other
proceedings may include, but are not limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements,
raw material or energy supply, environmental, health and safety, joint venture agreements and labor and
employment matters, as well as other harms resulting from the actions of individuals or entities outside of our
control. Litigation based on environmental matters or human exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace
or from our products could result in significant liability for us. In the event of a negative outcome in any material
legal proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a settlement agreement, we could be obliged to make substantial
payments. We currently maintain product liability insurance to cover our liability risks consistent with industry
practice. However, there can be no assurance that a successful product liability or other claim would be adequately
covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations.
Even if there is a positive outcome to such proceedings, negative publicity and advisory costs, to the extent they
are not reimbursable by other litigants or insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, our products have widespread uses in a variety of end-markets, including transportation, consumer
products and pharmaceuticals. If a product liability claim or series of claims arising out of these various uses
(particularly where the value of such claims is in excess of our insurance coverage, applicable indemnification
agreements, or any provision we made), were successful against us, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could be required to increase our debt or
divert resources from other investments in our business in order to discharge any such claims, or might not be
able to cover such claims at all. Additionally, new determinations about the safety of our products may be made
in the future and such determinations may lead to a substantial decline of the sale of any affected products, both
of which could materially affect the profitability of our operations.

More generally, in the chemicals industry, products, raw materials, and operations are subject to public scrutiny
from investors, customers, and activist groups and may become the target of negative publicity or protests and
campaigns by public interest groups relating to environmental, health and safety concerns, which, in turn, could
lead the public to develop a negative perception of certain of our operations and products, which could materially
affect sales and volumes of our products or result in negative regulatory developments.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

After the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have had total financial
indebtedness of €697.2 million. See “Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences
to Holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- making us vulnerable to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry
conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal
of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, or other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may_**
**_make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

The terms of the Indenture will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness,
including in respect of committed borrowings of up to €110 million under the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement. We may incur additional debt in the future, some of which may rank pari passu with the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, be structurally senior to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, or be secured by assets that
do not form part of the Collateral for the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. Any such additional indebtedness could
also mature prior to the Notes. We may also enter into a qualified receivables financing program which would
allow us to pledge our receivables that either do not form part of the Collateral or would be released from any
security interests in respect of such receivables. Although the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the
Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a
number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness
that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the New Revolving
Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements. Furthermore, if we are able to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries
under the Indenture as unrestricted subsidiaries, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow
beyond the limitations specified in the Indenture and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries
may not engage. See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New
_Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement.” If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the_
related risks that we now face would increase.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations and capital_**
**_needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

49


-----

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of such entity;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain investments;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to,
and on the transfer of, assets to such entity;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- consolidate or merge with other entities;

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

- (in case of the Issuer only) engage in activities other than certain permitted holding company activities.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants.” Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants to which we are subject could_
limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities
and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we will be subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the New Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement. A breach of any of those covenants or the occurrence of certain specified events will, subject
to applicable cure periods and other limitations, result in an event of default under the New Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement.

Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the
Acceleration Majority Lenders (being, subject to certain limitations, lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement whose commitments thereunder aggregate more than 66 [2]/3% of the total commitments
thereunder) could, while such event of default remains unremedied or unwaived, cancel the availability of the
New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the New Revolving
Credit Facilities Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default
or event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default and
acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the
Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement,
accelerate the payment of amounts owing to them under such other debt instruments, we cannot assure you that
our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all our
other liabilities and the liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to
enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors
could proceed against any security interests granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and may be forced to take other_**
**_actions to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._**

We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. Our ability to make principal or interest
payments when due on our indebtedness, including our drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future
performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, legal and regulatory factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” as well as elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum, as well as other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our New Revolving Credit Facility will mature in 2027 and the Notes will mature in 2028. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of loans outstanding under the_
New Revolving Credit Facility and of the obligations under the Notes and any other debt which we incur, if we
do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to
fund our other liquidity needs, or we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual
limitations, we may be required to refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our
indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our

50


-----

business obligations, activities or capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional debt or equity financing in
amounts that could be substantial, or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on
or before maturity. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely
basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that those actions would secure sufficient funds to meet our obligations
under our indebtedness.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such
time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing conditions in the international
credit and capital markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and
may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the
Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement may restrict us from adopting some of these
alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on
a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur
additional indebtedness.

In addition, we use a Securitization Program and a Factoring Program to meet some of our liquidity requirements
and are subject to various covenants thereunder. If we fail to comply with these covenants, a default may occur
and we may need to fund our working capital requirements from other sources.

In the absence of operating results and resources sufficient to service our indebtedness we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and
other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including the terms of the Indenture and the New Revolving
Credit Facilities Agreement, will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and the use of proceeds from any such
disposal. We may not be able to carry out certain disposals or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from
the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to
meet any of our debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not
permit us to meet our debt service obligations.

**_Drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Floating Rate Notes will bear interest_**
**_at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing cash flows._**

Drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Floating Rate Notes will, and future
indebtedness that we may incur could, bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR,
compounded SARON or term SOFR (as applicable) or other benchmarks, plus a spread. These interest rates could
rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated with these obligations, reducing
cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates,
there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable
terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including
costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest
expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

**_EURIBOR or other benchmarks may be discontinued or change in the future._**

Various interest rate benchmarks (including historic EURIBOR) have been the subject of recent national and
international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective, including the EU
Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented.

EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical
benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms
and other pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently
than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants
to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be
predicted. Based on the foregoing, you should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or
any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof,
could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it
more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR (or any of their successors or other benchmarks) is
discontinued, that may require amendments to the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have not

51


-----

transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be
determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such
obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of
offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates
information at the relevant time). In addition, the development of future alternatives to EURIBOR may result in
the Floating Rate Notes performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to
EURIBOR had not developed.

The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered,
the Issuer could, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, determine an appropriate successor rate,
which means that interest on the Floating Rate Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate,
together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate Notes issued on
or about the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” The Indenture may
require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as
to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the
holders of the Floating Rate Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may
be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Floating Rate Notes.

In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement
of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at
the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of
EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such
consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If
EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be
determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral and other distressed disposals._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured initially on a first priority basis by the same Collateral
securing the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and certain cash management
obligations, if any, and certain hedging obligations, if any. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will
be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same
Collateral on a pari passu or on a super priority basis.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, providers
of certain additional indebtedness, certain cash management obligations, if any, and certain hedging obligations,
if any, the Security Agent, any receiver and certain creditor representatives are entitled to be repaid with the
proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a
foreclosure of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if
the aggregate of the then outstanding claims under super senior indebtedness are greater than or equal to the
proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all
obligations under super senior indebtedness have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied _pro rata in_
repayment of the Notes, any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank _pari passu_
with the Notes and certain cash management obligations, if any, and certain hedging obligations, if any, that do
not rank on a super-senior basis.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent
for the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the cash management and hedging
obligations that are permitted by the Indenture to be secured on the Collateral, and any additional debt secured by
the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Indenture will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the
Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take
enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group (as defined below under “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i) creditors holding in aggregate_
more than 66[2]/3% of the aggregate commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the aggregate
commitments under any super senior credit facility and the aggregate of hedging exposures under certain priority
hedging obligations and exposures under certain cash management facilities (the “Majority Super Senior
**Creditors”) and (ii) creditors holding in aggregate more than 50% of the outstanding principal amount of the**
Notes and the outstanding principal amount of any indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes (the “Majority

52


-----

**Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representative). If, however,**
before the discharge of all super senior obligations, the Security Agent has received conflicting enforcement
instructions from the creditor representatives (and for these purposes, silence is deemed to be a conflicting
instruction) then, to the extent the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (to the extent given)
comply with the initial consultation requirements and the security enforcement principles set forth in the
Intercreditor Agreement (one of which states that the primary and overriding objective of an enforcement of
security over the Collateral is the maximization, so far as is consistent with prompt and expeditious realization of
value, of recoveries by the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (each as defined below under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement”)), the Security Agent will comply
with the instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, provided that if the super senior liabilities have
not been fully discharged within six months, or no enforcement action has occurred within three months of the
date on which the first such enforcement instructions were first issued, then the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors will prevail. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis
with the Notes, the voting interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurately
with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

The lenders and other creditors under our super senior indebtedness may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue
their remedies in respect of the Collateral at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes
to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, as applicable,
against, and the liens over any other assets of, such entities and any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Notes
and the Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_Certain Collateral will not initially secure the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantors will not initially guarantee_**
**_the Notes._**

On or about the Issue Date, the Notes and the Issue Date Guarantees will be secured by the Issue Date Collateral.
Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we will be required to take such necessary actions so that, consistent with
the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, on or about the Issue Date (or, in any case, no later than 120 days
after the Issue Date), the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are secured, to the extent not already so secured, by the
applicable Collateral, which will also secure the New Revolving Credit Facility subject to the Agreed Security
Principles. There can, however, be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such liens within the time
period specified, if at all.

In addition, on or about the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by CABB Group GmbH.
Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, we will be required to take such necessary actions so that, substantially
consistent with the New Revolving Credit Facility within 120 days of the Issue Date and the Notes are also
guaranteed, on a senior basis with respect to the Notes by the Subsidiary Guarantors. There can, however, be no
assurance that the Subsidiary Guarantors will provide their relevant guarantees within the time period specified,
if at all.

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Collateral described in this
Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement, certain additional indebtedness and certain hedging obligations, if any and cash management
obligations, if any. Upon a refinancing of the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, or if the lenders under
the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement consent to an increase of the commitments under the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the amount that will benefit from first priority security interest in the
Collateral may be increased up to the amount provided under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure
additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any
increase in the obligations secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend
upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of
the economies in which our operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral

53


-----

should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a
market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our
liquidation. In addition, the share pledges over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject
to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The Collateral is located in Germany, Finland, Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the United States, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the Collateral may
limit the realizable value of the Collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws
of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other, including in the areas
of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and
duration of the proceedings.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of_**
**_permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the_**
**_granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the_**
**_laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may create hardening periods for
such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future
indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular,
as the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances,
including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness, the transfer of Collateral within the Group and
the implementation of certain corporate reorganizations. The applicable hardening period for these new security
interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the
security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.
See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and equity
interests for the benefit of holders of the notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that
have the benefit of first priority security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether
on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability
of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can
be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements,
statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests granted in favor of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral in certain jurisdictions. The Security Agent may
also need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security
Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties
will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent
may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease.

In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation of the
business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes and certain Collateral will be granted subsequent to the issuance of the Notes. The ability of the_**
**_Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the
Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted
only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only

54


-----

the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will
not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

The granting of security interests (if any) in favor of a foreign security agent (acting for and on behalf of third-party
beneficiaries) will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation of such security
agent is valid under the law governing its appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending on the
type of the security interests granted. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5,
2005, as amended, concerning financial collateral arrangements (the “Financial Collateral Law 2005”), a
security interest which constitutes financial collateral (in accordance with the provisions of the Financial
Collateral Law 2005) may be provided in favor of a person acting for and on behalf of the beneficiary of such
security interest, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present
or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to
their obligations vis-à-vis third party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the
security interest, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the
security interest provided under the Financial Collateral Law 2005.

Under German law, accessory security interests such as pledges over shares or bank accounts cannot be granted
to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. In this
respect, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a so-called parallel debt obligation (the
“Parallel Debt”) in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors toward
the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). Under the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable
at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations discharges
the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt discharges the corresponding
Principal Obligations, in each case, by the amount of such payment.

Certain of the Security Documents will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the
obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. In Germany there is no statutory or case law available on the
validity or enforceability of the parallel debt construct or the security provided for such parallel debt. To the extent
the Parallel Debt construct would be successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to receive any proceeds from the enforcement of the security interests in the relevant Collateral. In
addition, holders of the Notes will bear the risk associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Security Agent or a breach of its obligations as Security Agent towards the secured creditors. “Certain Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

**_The interests of our principal shareholder may conflict with the interests of the holders of Notes._**

The interests of our principal shareholder may, in certain circumstances, conflict with your interests as a holder
of Notes. Permira Funds and its affiliates indirectly control the Issuer. As a result, it has, and will continue to
have, indirectly the power, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day
operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our
operations. Our principal shareholder may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings
or other transactions that, in their judgment, will enhance their equity investments, although such transactions
might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes. For example, our principal shareholder could vote to cause us to
incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or pay dividends, in each case so long as the Indenture
so permits. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of
certain assets could reduce our ability to generate sales, each of which could adversely affect you as a holder of
Notes. In addition, our principal shareholder may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours
or do business with us.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early you may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives proceeds due_
to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security at an effective
interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they_**
**_may be sold._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register the Notes
or the Notes Guarantees under, the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so
registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Notice to Prospective U.S.
_Investors,” “Notice to Certain European Investors” and “Notice to Residents of Canada.” We have not agreed to_
or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do
so.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in exchange
for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests
will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depository (or its nominee) for Euroclear and
Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch, as paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these
payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing
the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest in the Notes,
you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act
upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies
to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters
or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the definitive registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to
acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest
rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade
securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar
to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the
market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market
for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is
possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative
effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is
no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you
may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

56


-----

Although an application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Securities Official List of the LuxSE, we
cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. Failure to be approved for listing or the delisting
(whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from
the Securities Official List of the LuxSE may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as
applicable, in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact the
liquidity of the Notes.

**_The Floating Rate Notes will be issued with original issue discount for US federal income tax purposes._**

Because the Floating Rate Notes will be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, in addition to the stated cash interest on such Notes, U.S. holders (as defined under “Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) of Floating Rate Notes will generally be_
required to include the amounts representing the OID in gross income on a constant yield basis in advance of
receipt of the cash payments to which such income is attributable. As a result, U.S. holders of Floating Rate Notes
will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. See “Tax
_Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing**

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the_**
**_Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than
investments in its subsidiaries. It depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its
obligations. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the obligations on the Notes through a
combination of dividends and interest payments on intercompany loans. The obligations under intercompany loans
will be junior obligations and will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior and senior
subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, including obligations under, or guarantees of obligations under, the New
Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes.

The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flow
of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of
the Issuer, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or
advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict, and in some cases, may actually
prevent the ability of the subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Such restrictions include those
created by the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, which limit payments
of principal on the Notes prior to their stated maturity. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_New Revolving Credit_ Facilities Agreement” and “—Intercreditor Agreement.” Applicable tax laws may also
subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries
will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that, even
though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be
permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their
restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing_**
**_the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will_**
**_be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released
automatically, including sales to third parties in connection with the establishment of a qualified receivables
financing. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

Even though the holders of the Notes share in the Collateral ratably with the lenders under the New Revolving
Credit Facility, under certain circumstances, the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
and certain of our cash management and hedging arrangements will control enforcement actions with respect to
the Collateral through the Security Agent, whether or not the holders of the Notes agree or disagree with those
actions. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Enforcement of Security Interest.”

57


-----

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, including sales to third parties
and in connection with certain corporate reorganizations. See “Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees—
_Note Guarantees Release.”_

**_The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares_**
**_(if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preference
shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary
over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the Notes
Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration
or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their
indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those
subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference
shareholders (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Guarantors represented 99.5% of the Adjusted EBITDA
(disregarding the EBITDA of any member of the Group that generates negative EBITDA).

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under certain applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/ or the grantor of
the security. The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of
these security interests. In addition, certain applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after
the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain
proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and
identified. Absent perfection, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, may have difficulty
enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties, including a
trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors, including those who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

**_Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_**
**_limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Notes Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In
addition, the Issuer and the other Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the
relevant Security Documents. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited
in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest and the Indenture will
provide that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant
Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective
under German, Luxembourg, Finnish, Swiss, United States or other applicable law or without resulting in a breach
of any applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes Guarantee or Security Document would be subject to certain
generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws,
guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the debtor-in-possession, bankruptcy receiver or trustee,
in case of bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy),
and a court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any
legal act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Notes Guarantees or
the security interests granted under the Security Documents see “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”) and, if_
payment had already been made under a Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security
Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the
relevant Guarantor, if the court found, inter alia, that:

58


-----

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

- the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was granted with actual intent
to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when
the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee
or security interest;

- under Luxembourg law, the Notes Guarantees (if any) or the security interest (if any) under a Security
Document would be granted with the intention to defraud the creditors of, and prejudice their means of
recovery against, the Guarantor, and where the recipient or beneficiary and the Guarantor were aware or
should have been aware at the time of granting the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interests that such
grant would prejudice the means of recovery of one or more (present or future) creditors of the Guarantor,
unless the act was entered into without any consideration, in which case knowledge by the counterparty is not
necessary for a challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant Notes
Guarantee or security interests and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the
relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the
relevant Notes Guarantee or Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur,
indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or

- the relevant Notes Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the
Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider.

The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the
obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security Documents. There can be no assurances that we will have
distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security
Documents, whether or not we make dividends. In addition, the payment under the Notes Guarantees and the
enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate
formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and
board resolutions. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Enforcement of the collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the Collateral will thus
be subject to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in
multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings
are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the
enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger
disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the security
and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. A summary description of certain aspects
of the insolvency laws of Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, the United States and certain jurisdictions
where the providers of collateral are organized or have their center of main activities are set out in “Certain
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency_
_Law Considerations.”_

**_The insolvency laws of Germany, Finland, Luxembourg and Switzerland and other jurisdictions may not be as_**
**_favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments_**
**_due on the Notes._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and the Guarantors (other than the Issuer and the
Guarantors incorporated in the United States) are incorporated under the laws of Germany, Finland, and
Switzerland. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Germany,
Finland, Luxembourg or Switzerland or other relevant jurisdiction. The bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative
and other laws of the Issuer’ and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially
different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of
creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any

59


-----

particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” with respect_
to the jurisdictions mentioned above.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the_**
**_occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control”, the Issuer would be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the
date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we
cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient
funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing
contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an
event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default
under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash
from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change
of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. If an event constituting a change of control
occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the
Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt
to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not
obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would
require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes, upon a change of control. We cannot assure
you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would
constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_In certain circumstances, a Change of Control Offer will not be required to be made._**

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event
of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power
or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.
In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the
Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if a specified consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded
immediately prior to and after giving pro forma effect to such event. Except as described under “Description of
_the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to_
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

Furthermore, the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of our Acetyls business unit (or any part
thereof) will not constitute a Change of Control subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set out in the
Indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the applicable Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition
of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the applicable
Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change
of control has occurred and whether the Issuer are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to
a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the values of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which
investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return

60


-----

on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and
could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which
the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other
than U.S. dollars by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange
gains or losses, if any. See “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors (other than the Guarantors incorporated in the United States) and their respective
subsidiaries are organized outside the United States and a substantial portion of our business is conducted entirely
outside the United States. Following the Issue Date, we expect the directors, managers and/or executive officers
of the Issuer and the non-U.S. Guarantors to be non-residents of the United States and substantially all of their
assets will be located outside the United States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of
certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect
service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as a
substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of
their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce
judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme
Court, actions of the Issuer and the non-U.S. Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal
securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters
with Germany, Finland, Luxembourg and Switzerland. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in
Germany, Finland, Luxembourg and Switzerland of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment
in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Germany, Finland, Luxembourg and Switzerland of any
judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be
subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in Germany, Finland, Luxembourg or Switzerland
would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such
jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil
_Liabilities.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect
the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other
factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities
and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be
given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered
or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more
of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes.

**_Risks related to base erosion, profit shifting and related measures._**

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) together with the G20 countries has
committed to reduce perceived abusive global tax avoidance, referred to as base erosion and profit shifting
(“BEPS”). The OECD published its final reports in relation to its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
(BEPS) on October 5, 2015, which were endorsed at the G20 summit in November 2015, and the multilateral
instrument to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS was published on November 24, 2016. As
part of this commitment, an Action Plan has been developed to address BEPS with the aim of securing tax revenue
by realigning taxation with economic activities and value creation by creating a single set of consensus based
international tax rules. As part of the BEPS project, new rules dealing with the operation of double tax treaties,
the definition of permanent establishments, interest deductibility and the taxation of hybrid instruments and hybrid
entities have already been introduced and will continue to be introduced in relevant tax legislation of participating
OECD countries. Depending on if and how these proposals are implemented, they may result in material changes
to tax laws which can impact the tax treatment of income and gains arising at the level of the Issuer, intermediate
companies and portfolio companies, which may adversely impact how the returns to investors are taxed Such
implementation may also give rise to additional reporting and disclosure obligations for the Issuer, intermediate
companies, and investors. As part of the global OECD BEPS project, Luxembourg has signed (together with 88
jurisdictions) the so-called multilateral instrument (“MLI”) that will transpose anti-BEPS measures into some of

61


-----

the treaties that Luxembourg has concluded. Luxembourg ratified the MLI through the law dated March 7, 2019
and has deposited its instrument of ratification on April 9, 2019 with the OECD. As a result, the MLI has entered
into force in Luxembourg on August 1, 2019 for double tax treaties concluded with countries which would also
deposit their ratification instruments before the end of April 2019 (such as, among others, Austria, France,
Guernsey, Ireland, Jersey, Malta, Netherlands and the United Kingdom). For all countries which ratify the MLI
after Luxembourg, its dates of application should be calculated on an individual basis. The MLI notably introduces
a “principal purpose test” (“PPT”) denying tax treaty benefits to companies when obtaining such benefits was
“one of the principle purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in” these
benefits, unless granting these benefits under the given circumstances would be “in accordance with the object
and purpose of the relevant provisions” of the tax treaty. Whether a Luxembourg entity relying on tax treaty
benefits can be construed as being part of such type of arrangement will predominantly depend on source state
views.

**_Risks related to the ATAD Provisions._**

In the context of national implementation of certain BEPS measures, the EU has adopted the Council Directive
(EU) 2016/1164 of July 12, 2016 (“ATAD I”) that addresses some of the items of the BEPS project, including
among others hybrid mismatch rules, interest deduction limitation, controlled foreign companies rules, but also
provisions which are not linked to BEPS project, such as exit taxation and a General Anti-Avoidance Rule. The
ATAD I grants EU member states certain options in the implementation of the directive into their domestic laws.

ATAD I was transposed into Luxembourg domestic law by the law of December 21, 2018 and entered into force
on January 1, 2019. ATAD I was amended by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 (“ATAD
**II”, and together with ATAD I, “ATAD”), which was implemented into Luxembourg law on December 20, 2019.**

ATAD may limit the deduction of interest and other deductible payments as well as expenses for Luxembourg
companies subject to corporate income tax (such as the Issuer). Whilst (i) the Luxembourg laws implementing
ATAD may be subject to future amendment by the relevant Luxembourg authorities and (ii) the impact of ATAD
is not yet entirely clear, ATAD may result in corporate income tax being effectively imposed and due on the Issuer
to the extent that the Issuer derives income other than interest income or income equivalent to interest from its
underlying assets and transactions or, for instance, if the Notes qualify for tax purposes as hybrid financial
instruments.

In addition, the EU released on December 22, 2021 a directive proposal which aims to fight against the misuse of
shell entities for tax purposes and ensure that EU entities with no or minimal economic activity are unable to
benefit from certain tax advantages (the so-called ATAD III). These new rules would mainly apply to EU entities
(i) deriving passive income, (ii) engaged in cross-border transactions and (iii) which outsourced the administration
of day-to-day operations and the decision-making on significant functions. EU entities that meet these three
conditions would need to declare in their annual tax returns whether they meet indicators of minimum substance
and provide related documentary evidence. Entities not meeting those indicators of minimum substance will be
presumed not to have sufficient substance for tax purposes (unless they can rebut this presumption by providing
evidence (i) of the business activities which they perform to generate their passive income or (ii) that they do not
serve the objective of obtaining a tax advantage). In this case and in the absence of rebuttal of the presumption,
such EU entities would not be allowed to benefit from the provisions of double tax treaties or certain EU Directives
(such as the Interest and Royalties EU Directive). In addition, they would not be entitled to a certificate of tax
residence to the extent that such certificate serves to obtain the benefit of the aforementioned provisions.

Although it is too early to anticipate how these rules will be transposed in the EU (and interpreted by the relevant
tax authorities), it should be kept in mind that these rules (if and when implemented) would possibly increase the
withholding tax cost of investments structured via an intermediate vehicle that (i) does not meet the indicators of
minimum substance and (ii) cannot rebut the above presumption of lack of substance.

_Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, which are reproduced elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, as_
_well as from the accounting records and from the internal accounting systems of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., and_
_should be read in conjunction with the information presented below._

_The 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and_
_the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS and were audited_
_by KPMG Luxembourg, which issued unqualified audit opinions._

_Some of the statements contained below relate to future sales, costs, capital expenditures and financial condition_

_may differ materially from the results expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. A discussion_
_of such uncertainties can be found under “Forward-Looking Statements.” In addition, investing in the Notes_
_involves risks. Such risks are discussed under “Risk Factors.”_

**Business Overview**

We are a leading CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) and fine chemistry manufacturer
with global operations, supplying customized ingredients to major players in the Western Crop Science market,
as well as high purity and high-complexity chemical ingredients to customers in the Life Science and Performance
Material markets. Our strong technology portfolio, technical know-how and execution capabilities allow us to
cover a wide spectrum of highly specialized customer needs, specifications and complexity profiles.

Headquartered in Germany, we operate a global network with six production facilities located in Pratteln
(Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland), Galena (Kansas, United States), Gersthofen (Germany), Knapsack (Germany)
and Jining, Shandong Province (China).

Our varied product portfolio is organized across two product groups: (i) Exclusives (tailor-made active ingredients
and precursors developed for individual customers on an exclusive basis (our CDMO offering)) and Specialties
(highly specialized ingredients with applications in high-margin end-markets) products and (ii) Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals products (intermediate and base chemical products such as high purity
monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), chloroacetyl chloride (“CAC1”) and caustic soda across a large purity spectrum
with multiple end-use applications).

Our products are deeply embedded into our customers’ value chains, often on a near-exclusive basis, allowing us
to be aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination and to set up scalable manufacturing facilities
and efficient commercial production processes. The combination of our production know-how, lengthy product
development processes and contractually agreed capital expenditure contributions for some of our products
typically result in high contract renewal rates and low customer churn.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of €755.5 million and an Adjusted
EBITDA of €162.6 million (21.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin). Between 2020 and 2022, our revenue grew at
23.9% CAGR, whereas our Adjusted EBITDA grew at 20.0% CAGR. Exclusives and Specialties contributed to
56.8% of our revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 whereas Advanced Intermediates and Base
Chemicals accounted for 43.2% of our revenue for the same period.

Our products are used for end-market applications mainly in: (i) Crop Science (e.g., herbicides, fungicides,
insecticides and other livestock and crop protection products), (ii) Life Science (e.g., pharma, personal care,
nutrition, fragrances and flavor applications) and (iii) Performance Materials (e.g., curatives in epoxies,
polyimides, polyesters and other resin systems used for electronic components, semiconductors and for
composites, fibers, films, and foams that provide heat and electrical resistance). These end-markets, in particular
Crop Science, have shown resilient historical growth rates and benefit from structural mega-trends that are
expected to drive further resilient growth in the near- to mid-term, such as increasing demand for food and need
for increased farming yields on the one hand, and an aging population and improving living standards on the other.
In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the
Crop Science market, approximately 20% in the Life Science market, approximately 15% in the Performance
Materials market and approximately 15% relate to others (e.g., base chemicals and industrial MCA) (measured as
a percentage of revenues).

Exclusives, our CDMO offering, provides tailor-made active ingredients and precursors tailored to individual
customer specifications in Crop Science and are a primary contributor to our overall profitability. Based on
customer-developed IP, these products require customized production lines, expansive know-how and close
cooperation with our customers. We offer development and manufacturing services for proprietary products on
an exclusive and confidential basis to leading players in the Crop Science market such as: BASF, Bayer, Corteva
and Syngenta, and we have relationships with nearly all major players in the Western Crop Science market.

Our Specialties offering consists of specialty ingredients that leverage our considerable manufacturing expertise
to create complex chemical products that serve specific customer needs across a variety of applications in the
Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials industries. Unlike Exclusives, these products can be
offered to multiple customers at a time. Our offering highlights our excellent production capabilities and knowhow along with our ability to offer specialized technology process and development services which allows us to
continuously provide high-quality and purity products to our customers and which we believe is a key
differentiator in this field. Our Specialties products are also a strong contributor to profitability, leveraging our
close client relationship and high customer “stickiness”. In particular, we offer high value-add products for fastgrowing applications in Life Science (pharma and personal care as well as nutrition) and Performance Materials
markets (coatings, e.g., in electronics or other industrial applications), backed by several attractive long-term
customer contracts, which offer high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Customers for our
Specialties products include players such as Agilent Technologies, Bayer, Corteva, Deciem/Estee Lauder, DSM,
Evonik, Merck, Novartis and Syngenta.

In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, we offer intermediate and base chemical
products, such as MCA, CAC1 and caustic soda, that serve as chemical building blocks for other secondary
chemical processes with a variety of applications across a large number of industries and markets. We believe we
are one of the leading suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas and we operate state-of-the-art sites,
allowing us to provide a full range of purity and quality for our customers. Large parts of our Advanced
Intermediates supply agreements feature price formulas that allow us to partially pass on price increases in costs
of certain raw materials. Furthermore, we also generate a portion of our revenue from Base Chemicals and other
products such as caustic soda, that are generated as by-products from our Exclusives and Advanced Intermediates
production lines.

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

**_Development of mega-trends in the Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials markets_**

_Crop Science market_

In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the
Crop Science market (measured as a percentage of revenues). Accordingly, with our focus on the Crop Science
market, our results of operations are affected by changes in the market environment and the demand for our
products by our customers. In particular, the underlying global Crop Science market growth is driven by megatrends such as a growing population driving demand for food and crops and decreasing arable land per capita,
requiring efficient crop protection products to increase farming yields. Our results are also affected by trends in
the addressable CDMO Crop Science market such as a growth in CDMO outsourcing and increasing complexity
of active ingredient molecules requiring specialist CDMO partners with strong technical expertise and assets
fitting into global supply chains of Crop Science players (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

From 2019 to 2022, the underlying global Crop Science market grew at a CAGR of 7.8% from €55.6 billion to
€69.6 billion due to trends such as favorable weather conditions, increased crop prices as well as increased
manufacturing and logistics costs partially passed through with the product price (Roland Berger Report). See
“Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺General⸺Key Drivers.”

Herbicides, fungicides and insecticides, for which we supply tailor-made products, as well as high-quality
intermediates, to our customers, play an essential role in crop protection and result in higher productivity per acre
(higher crop yields). In 2022, herbicides, the largest sub-segment of the underlying global Crop Science market,
accounted for approximately 40%. Insecticides accounted for approximately 30%, fungicides for approximately
28% and others (e.g. plant growth regulators) approximately 3% of the market. The majority of the different
segments are expected to grow with a CAGR between 2% and 3% until 2027, with the exception of herbicides,
which is expected to grow at a CAGR of less than 1% between 2022 and 2027. Overall, the global Crop Science
market growth is expected at a CAGR of 2% between 2022 and 2027 (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor).

68


-----

_Life Science market_

In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 20% of our products were used in the Life
Science market (measured as a percentage of revenues). We have considerable manufacturing power for chemical
products aimed for the Life Science market. However, our results of operations are affected by macroeconomic
changes in the Life Science market and the ultimate demand for our customers’ products. See “Risk
_Factors⸺Risks Related to the Industry in Which we Operate⸺Economic downturns or worsening global_
_economic conditions may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows”_
and “⸺Changes in our customers’ products or processes can reduce the demand for our products.”

Markets for Life Science products served by us showed varying growth rates between 2019 and 2022. Our targeted
Life Science market segments also include several fast-growing niche products such as DCA, which significantly
increased in size during the same period. The addressable Life Science market growth is driven by supportive
developments in specific segments with a high demand for specialty products, such as novel RNA therapeutics,
vitamins and supplements, as well as a rising adoption in skin care products. In addition, the Life Science market
is further positively impacted by certain mega-trends such as a global aging population, together with an increasing
disposable income spent on health and personal care. Our customers include some of the largest established market
brands in the cosmetics (including anti-aging products), vitamin and supplements industries. Our top products
comprise Monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), Dichloroacetic acid (“DCA”), Glycolic acid (“GA”) and Ethyl-2chloroacetoacetate (“CAE”), each with several high-value applications across the Life Science market. In personal
care, our high purity MCA acts as basis for Betaine synthesis used, e.g., for shampoos, toothpaste or synthetic
caffeine. In addition, we are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade
DCA (a key ingredient for RNA-based medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity
DCA revenue as of 2022). In cosmetic grade GA, we are globally the second largest supplier (measured by revenue
as of 2022) and the only European producer with global coverage. In the vitamins market, CAE produced in our
plants is used as the basis for Vitamin B6 synthesis that are further applied in, for example, nutrition (Company
assessment based on the Roland Berger Report). See “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺General.”

_Performance Materials market_

Alongside our operations in the Crop Science and Life Science markets, our results of operations are also driven
by changes in the global Performance Materials market and the demand for our products by our customers. In
2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 15% of our products were used in the
Performance Materials market (measured as a percentage of revenues).

High Performance Materials are increasingly needed by suppliers to manufacture their complex products, with
our chemicals being used in, among others, flexible printed circuitry and foldable displays for smart devices,
composite components for automotive and aviation, thermal insulation for aircraft and marine vessels, coatings
and tubing for medical devices and radiation shielding for spacecraft. See “Industry and Market
_Data⸺Performance Materials⸺Specialty Anhydrides⸺General.”_

**_Volume, product mix and pricing_**

Individual product volumes and margins as well as our product mix are key drivers to maintaining and enhancing
our profitability.

We hold strong market positions across certain of our product groups in the Crop Science, Life Science and
Performance Materials markets. We believe that we are among the top two Western CDMO players in the Crop
Science market (by Crop Science CDMO revenue as of 2021). The active ingredients and precursors that we
supply to our Crop Science customers are used in the production of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides.
Demand for these products and therefore the volumes that we sell may vary from year to year based on, amongst
others, external factors such as weather conditions in different parts of the world and prevailing crop prices, which
in turn can impact our margins. Our key Crop Science customers are active on a global scale and our sales to them
are oftentimes based on longer-term contracts. Moreover, being a specialized CDMO is a service business, most
of our Exclusives products are tailored to an individual customer’s specific requirements based on their intellectual
property and, therefore, critical to the production or performance of our customers’ products. In addition, our
portfolio comprises innovative products in niche markets with high growth rates, such as DCA (Roland Berger
Report, Company Information). We are one of the largest European Life Science MCA suppliers (by production
volume in Europe as of 2022). We are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high
purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNA-based medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications
(by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022) (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). See also

-----

“⸺Development of mega-trends in the Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials Markets” and
“Industry and Market Data.”

We benefit from the critical nature of certain of our Exclusive and Specialties ingredients to the performance of
our customers’ products as well as our high integration into our customers’ value chain, sometimes being the
primary supplier of certain key products, which is in such cases embedded into our contractual agreements with
our customers.

For our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals group, which comprises a number of products, each with a
broad range of customers, our business operations are mostly driven by underlying supply and demand market
dynamics as well as our plant utilization rates. MCA, as one of our main products in Advanced Intermediates and
Base Chemicals, is mainly used in the Life Science and the Crop Science markets. Historically, demand for MCA
has grown across various end-markets, which, we believe, has contributed to our high utilization rates.
Furthermore, proximity to customers and supply chain expertise are critical due to the relatively high
transportation costs of distributing MCA. We believe we are also able to better serve our customers in this area
due to our differentiated logistics capabilities. Our Base Products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are
by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA, and are used in several end-markets including the broader
chemicals space, pulp and paper, alumina, soap, detergents and others. Caustic soda prices are highly volatile due
to their strong dependency on chlorine production (which impacts caustic supply, as caustic demand remains
relatively stable over time) and energy prices. The market price for caustic soda declined in 2020 and 2021 driven
by lower overall economic activity during the pandemic, thereby negatively impacting the contribution of some
of our products to our profitability for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, however it subsequently significantly
increased in 2022 with prices reaching an all-time high, which had a positive impact on our results which
materialized in a significant uplift of revenues in 2022. Since then, the market price of caustic soda has declined
to some extent and we expect it to normalize (at approximately €400-600/t, based on Western European spot rates)
further in the future (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

**_Raw materials and energy costs_**

Raw material and energy prices are key components of our cost of sales and therefore are a significant value lever
for our gross profit. Our cost of raw materials and supplies was €270.7 million or 47.9% of our cost of sales for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: €216.5 million or 47.0% of our cost of sales; 2020: €157.6 million
or 40.4% of our cost of sales).

The cost of raw materials has generally been correlated with industry wide supply, demand dynamics and global
economic conditions. For example, a primary driver for the increase in 2021 and 2022 was due to an increase in
certain raw materials prices such as acetic acid. We have a value-added pricing model with partial cost passthrough mechanisms in some of our contracts. Since price volatilities in raw material or energy prices could have
a negative impact on our margins, we are highly focused on our ability to partially pass on raw material price
changes and our ability to maintain high degree of utilization in our plants.

In the Crop Science market in particular, raw materials used in the production of our Exclusives and Specialties
products are to a significant extent either provided by our customers and are therefore not recorded in our cost of
sales, or some of our customer contracts include partial pass-through clauses to protect against fluctuations in the
prices of raw materials, helping to protect against margin fluctuations. For example, in Exclusives, some contracts
are conversion fee model based and resulting revenues from most of such contracts were not exposed to any raw
material price fluctuations. In such contracts, raw materials are sourced directly through the customers or 100%
charged at cost at the end of the production run.

For Specialties and Advanced Intermediates products, some of our contracts include partial cost pass-throughs.
These partial pass-through provisions help to limit fluctuations in our cost of sales and therefore protecting
profitability by allowing us to partially pass on raw material price increases to our customers. For the Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals, our most important raw materials are acetic acid, acetic anhydride and chlorine
and certain customer contracts by sales include price formulas that allow for a partial pass-through of price
variations (not including chlorine price variations).

Alongside raw material costs, our cost of sales also include energy costs, which amounted to €65.6 million or
11.6% of our cost of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: €41.3 million or 9.0%; 2020: €35.1
million or 9.0% of our cost of sales). Operating our state-of-the-art technologies requires a significant amount of
energy. Rising energy prices, energy price fluctuations as well as environmental levies or government incentives
have had, and may continue to have, an impact on our margins. We therefore hedge against some of these price

volatilities, in particular for our sites in Germany and Switzerland. For the financial years ended December 31,
2020, 2021 and 2022, approximately 83%, 80% and 69%, respectively, of our electricity costs have been hedged
and for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we have hedged approximately 70% of our electricity costs
(measured as a percentage of total GWh).

**_Capital Expenditures and Capacity Expansion_**

Our capital expenditures (capex) focus on (a) targeted capacity expansions for new and existing products and debottlenecking projects in line with the specific customer demands (“Growth Capex”), (b) maintenance projects
to continuously upgrade and optimize our facilities and increase asset reliability levels as well as adopting our
facilities to the required regulatory and safety standards (“Maintenance Capex”), and (c) targeted plant upgrades
programs (including our “Fit for Future” (F4F) capex program to upgrade Pratteln assets, which is expected to
finish this year). Our cash capital expenditure for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 was €71.6 million
(2021: €68.6 million; 2020: €60.0 million). For the financial year ended December 31, 2023 we expect capital
expenditures to be in the mid-€60 million range.

Our capex allocation follows a stringent prioritization process managed by our Executive Committee and board
to review all projects regarding financial return, e.g., payback periods and return rates (predominantly Growth
Capex), binding customer commitments as well as implications on asset availability and safety prior to approval.
For Maintenance Capex, we focus on our capex allocation primarily on production lines with high margin potential
and/or strong customer demand and efficiency projects, e.g., improvements of energy efficiency, to ensure
adequate return rates from investments. For Growth Capex projects, we typically target EBITDA pay-back periods
of approximately three years and return rates of approximately 25% internal rate of return secured by binding
customer commitments, with customers signing either firm commitments for minimum volumes and/or
contributing a share of the capex via a fixed facility fee. While this is not achieved in all our projects, we aim to
strengthen our product portfolio over time with projects that either match our key criteria above or otherwise offer
strategic opportunities.

_Growth Capex_

Growth Capex accounted for slightly more than a third of our yearly capex spend and increased as a proportion
of total capex from 2020 to 2021 as a result of additional capacity expansion projects for new products in Finland
and Switzerland and has remained relatively constant as a proportion of total capex across 2021 and 2022.

Growth investments are mostly focused on high-margin Crop Science products and Life Science. We partner with
most of our CDMO customers through long-term contracts to deliver specialized active ingredients and precursors
according to individualized requests, often requiring custom production lines and processes. As a result, a large
share of our capex is invested in our CDMO business or in contracted capacity expansion for our Specialties
products.

A CDMO project development lifecycle of a new product can extend to up to 18 months in the customer request
phase as well as a further 24 months of investment period before commercialization. As a result, we aim to have
our customers take a share in the initial capex spend by entering into agreements with our clients to de-risk the
investments, with our long-term contracts for a large part of our portfolio, most of which featuring either
guaranteed volumes commitments for an initial period, up-front contributions to the capex requirements to set-up
production or ‘take-or-pay’ clauses. In general, we aim to recover our capex investment within approximately
three years from the start of commercialization and a typical production horizon for large, strategic products
extends historically to over 10 years.

Increasing our ability to onboard client projects, in 2019 we expanded our operations into the United States with
the acquisition of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries, including the Jayhawk facility in Galena, Kansas,
United States. Furthermore, as part of our capacity expansions at our multipurpose plants, we further expanded
our production capacities in Kokkola (Finland) to serve our customers in connection with already secured and
newly developed products for the Crop Science market.

_Maintenance Capex_

Overall, Maintenance Capex remained relatively constant as a proportion of total capex across 2020 and 2021,
increasing in 2022, in line with our growing asset base.

We allocate ongoing Maintenance Capex to support differentiation and competitiveness of our existing plants.
Our Maintenance Capex requirement is mainly driven by the corrosive nature of substances used in our production

process, making periodical inspection and maintenance of our plants and production chains necessary.
Furthermore, our Maintenance Capex helps to ensure asset availability, productivity, energy efficiency and
optimized performance. A significant proportion of yearly Maintenance Capex is allocated to maintenance works
for our production plants with Pratteln (as our largest site), accounting for a large share of yearly Maintenance
Capex expenses.

_F4F capex_

In 2018, we began the “Fit for Future” (“F4F”) capex program for our site in Pratteln. The project, which is
expected to finish this year, covers key aspects of our operations and comprises multiple initiatives to further
improve and safeguard asset safety, reliability, availability and compliance. Our F4F investment projects offer
returns via opportunities for price increases as well as additional volumes from the respective production lines.

**_Seasonality_**

Our results of operations for the first and fourth quarters of the year are generally stronger than our results of
operation for the second and third quarters, largely due to seasonal factors in demand from our Crop Science
customers. We typically experience an increase in production levels in the first and fourth quarters of the year in
order to meet the stronger demand in those quarters in line with increased demand for Crop Science products in
the Northern Hemisphere each spring prior to the growing season. In addition, we and other chemical companies,
including certain suppliers and customers, generally schedule repairs of machinery and facility turnarounds
(scheduled shutdowns of production units or facilities for maintenance) in the summer months, which may result
in lower sales in the second and third quarters relative to the first and fourth quarters of a given year. To the extent
possible, we try to coordinate such repair schedules with our customers and suppliers.

Seasonal fluctuations including adverse weather conditions may adversely affect certain of our markets and
customers, thereby impacting our quarterly results disproportionately due to the seasonal nature of our business.
For example, in the 2020 summer, the dry weather in Europe affected some of our customers and therefore
impacted demand. See “Risk Factors⸺Risks Related to Our Business⸺Seasonal fluctuations may impact our
_sales and cash flows.”_

**_Effects of COVID-19_**

Generally, in the financial year 2020, the Group’s business model proved to be resilient throughout the coronavirus
pandemic, as we experienced resilient end-customer demand from the Crop Science and Life Science markets,
benefitting from predictable revenues under existing long-term supply contracts for a large part of our portfolio.
Furthermore, we were able to maintain well-managed supply chains and ensure reliable production and delivery
channels to customers.

While we have experienced some delays in raw material deliveries and were required to adapt our processes in
procurement, inventory management and trade working capital strategies, the COVID-19 pandemic and the global
supply chain and transportation network disruptions did not have a material impact on our results of operations in
2020, 2021 and 2022, underlying the resilience of the business model.

COVID-19-related restrictions impacted Crop Science production in the first quarter of the financial year 2020
but normalized following the easing of lockdown restrictions. Whilst the COVID-19 restrictions did impact labor
availability, both in terms of production and field work, many countries deemed the agricultural sector to be of
considerable importance in order to maintain food security, therefore, restrictions on movement were less stringent
than in other industries.

**_Manufacturing Capacity Utilization and Planned maintenance turnarounds_**

Utilization rates of our manufacturing capacity is a significant driver of our profitability, since our cost of sales
comprises variable and fixed components. Fixed costs include plant related and overhead costs such as personnel
expenses, energy costs, repair and maintenance expenses, which are largely independent from production
volumes.

We operate our facilities at generally high utilization rates and continuously focus on further improving these
utilization rates. To maintain the efficiency of our assets, we regularly undergo scheduled maintenance shutdowns
in order to carry out required maintenance activities, perform necessary inspections and tests or accommodate for
shutdowns of key suppliers. We refer to these scheduled outages as “turnarounds”. The number and length of such
turnarounds carried out in any given period impact our operating results and the level of our capital expenditures.

72


-----

However, we try to coordinate such repair schedules with our customers and suppliers as they may also need to
undergo “turnarounds” at the same time. Furthermore, for our multi-purpose plants that produce customized and
specialized chemicals, whenever we change production from one product to another, we factor in the ‘switchover’ times required to clean the reactor vessels. This requires us to shut down operations of a production unit
within a production facility until the cleaning is completed. See “⸺Seasonality.”

Our production facilities undergo regular maintenance which requires the outage of a production unit or the entire
facility for a period of two to four weeks per year. Repair and maintenance costs in connection with such regular
maintenance can be up to several millions. In the past three years, our repair and maintenance expenses amounted
to €27.5 million in 2022 (2021: €21.4 million; 2020: €20.8 million).

**_Industry regulations_**

Our results of operations are also influenced by the evolving nature of regulations impacting the industries in
which our customers operate. In particular for our Exclusives and Specialties product group, certain customers
produce pharmaceuticals subject to evolving requirements, or complex Crop Science products subject to
developing rules around permitted usage. Such requirements have become increasingly extensive and complex,
requiring specialist CDMO partners with strong technical expertise and assets fitting into global supply chains of
Crop Science players. As a result of these changing requirements, we have taken a strategic decision in the past
to phase out certain services and products with lower margin to focus on our core strengths and expertise in Crop
Science, which offers us a more attractive business case and return on investment. Such strategic portfolio
management decisions have temporarily negatively affected our revenue for the respective years but have freed
up capacities and avoided cost increases for the expansion in our core business. See also “Regulation,
_Environmental, Health and Safety Measures” and “Risk Factors⸺Risks related to the Industry in which we_
_Operate⸺We are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations across multiple_
_jurisdictions. We are highly regulated and may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with, or address_
_liabilities under, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business.”_

**Key Income Statement Items**

Set forth below is a brief description of the composition of the key line items of our consolidated statement of
profit or loss:

**_Revenue_**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized in the amount of the consideration the Group expects to
receive in exchange for the goods or services when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. Control
is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can obtain all
substantial remaining benefits from them.

We primarily generate income from the sale of goods. For the Exclusives and Specialties product group, revenue
from specific customer contracts is recognized over time. In these cases our performance obligation consists in
the creation of an asset without an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for the
performance obligation completed to date. These contractually enforceable rights are recognized and disclosed
within ‘Accounts receivable, trade’ if already shipped, or otherwise within ‘Contract assets’.

Certain customer contracts for the Exclusives product group foresee non-refundable up-front capital expenditure
fees, which are paid by the customer at the beginning of the investment project. These advance payments are
recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in proportion to the performance used by the customer
during the contract period (output method). The outstanding performance obligation is disclosed in the balance
sheet at each reporting date.

If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in
time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognized at a specific point in time. Determination of the
point in time at which the customer obtains control of the goods occurs in the context of an overall assessment of
the circumstances which considers the existence of a present claim to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual
physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer
of risks and rewards takes into account the underlying terms of delivery (especially the International Commercial
Terms, or “Incoterms”) and is of particular practical significance. According to these principles, sales revenue
from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales comprises the costs of materials and supplies, personnel expenses, proportionate depreciation and
amortization, repairs and maintenance, energy, analysis and ecology, production overheads, plant overheads as
well as costs of packaging the products.

**_General and Administrative Expenses_**

General and administrative expenses comprise personnel expenses, legal and consultancy costs and other external
services as well as insurance premiums.

**_Distribution and Logistics Expenses_**

Distribution and logistics expenses comprise the costs of personnel expenses, proportionate depreciation on
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as transport costs.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research costs are recognized immediately as expense when they are incurred. They comprise wages and salaries,
cost of materials, proportionate depreciation on property, plant and equipment and overheads. Development costs
are only capitalized if, on the basis of various criteria, it is probable that the capitalized amount will be covered
by future income.

**_Financial Result_**

Financial result contains interest income and expenses as well as foreign currency gains and losses. Interest income
and expenses is recognized using the effective interest rate method.

**_Net Result for the Period_**

Net result for the year comprises net result for the year attributable to shareholders as well as net result for the
year attributable to non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests reflect a 32.4% share in CABB–Jinwei
Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co. Ltd., Zhanghuang Town (PRC) that is held by shareholders other than CABB
GmbH.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased year-on-year by €166.5 million or 28.3% from €589.0 million in the financial year ended
December 31, 2021 to €755.5 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022, due to strong demand in
both our product groups in 2022 across the portfolio supported by higher pricing effects.

The following table shows revenue by product group and by location of customers:

**Financial Year**
**2021** **2022** **Change**
**in € million** **(%)**
**Revenue by product group**
Exclusives and Specialties ............................................................... 367.3 429.3 16.9%
Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals ................................. 221.7 326.2 47.1%
**Revenue from external customers ................................................** **589.0** **755.5** **28.3%**

**Revenue by location of the customers**
Europe ............................................................................................. 434.2 570.4 31.4%
North America ................................................................................. 75.7 102.2 35.0%
Rest of World .................................................................................. 79.1 82.9 4.8%
**Revenue from external customers ................................................** **589.0** **755.5** **28.3%**

Revenue of the Exclusives and Specialties product group increased by €62.0 million or 16.9% from €367.3 million
in the financial year ended December 31, 2021 to €429.3 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022.
The strong revenue growth in Exclusives was both driven by higher volumes and by positive pricing effects, as
increased raw material prices were partially passed on to our customers. Revenue of Specialties increased, driven
by positive pricing effects and a continued strong demand for high-value products in regulated markets, such as
pharmaceutical, personal care, food and animal feed as well as in the automotive, aerospace and agrochemical
industries.

Revenue of the Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group increased by €104.5 million or 47.1%
from €221.7 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2021 to €326.2 million in the financial year ended
December 31, 2022, benefiting from favorable pricing effects. Revenue of our Advanced Intermediates increased
mainly due to our MCA products. The increase in revenue of these products was due to positive price effects
resulting from the partial pass-through of increased raw material prices and supply chain costs, which were
partially passed through via formula selling prices with a time lag. Revenue of Base Products increased, supported
by a strong demand and a significant increase in achieved price levels of acetic acid and caustic soda, which has
reached an all-time high.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by €104.7 million, or 22.7%, from €461.0 million for the financial year ended December
31, 2021 to €565.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. As a percentage of revenues, cost of
sales amounted to 74.9% of our revenues in the financial year ended December 31, 2022 and 78.3% of our
revenues in the financial year ended December 31, 2021.

The table below breaks down the cost of sales for the financial years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022:

**Financial Year**
**2021** **2022** **Change**
**in € million** **(%)**

Costs of raw materials and supplies ................................................ 216.5 270.7 25.0%
Personnel expenses ......................................................................... 93.7 98.3 4.9%
Energy costs .................................................................................... 41.3 65.6 58.8%

**Cost of sales ...................................................................................** **461.0** **565.7** **22.7%**

76


-----

The main driver for our cost of sales were cost of raw materials and supplies which increased from €216.5 million
in the financial year ended December 31, 2021 to €270.7 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022,
mainly because of raw material price increases, which were partially passed through to our customers, as well as
58.8% increase in our energy costs, which were partially passed through to our customers.

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by €61.8 million, or 48.3%, from €128.0 million for the financial year ended December 31,
2021 to €189.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher sales volumes
and positive pricing effects in both product groups.

_Research and Development Expenses_

Research and development expenses remained relatively stable at €3.9 million in the financial year ended
December 31, 2021 and €4.0 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022.

**Research and development expenses ..............................................................** **3.9** **4.0**

_Distribution and Logistics Expenses_

Distribution and logistics expenses increased by €20.0 million, or 31.5%, from €63.4 million for the financial year
ended December 31, 2021 to €83.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in
distribution and logistics expenses was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and higher transportation
costs.

The table below breaks down the distribution and logistics expenses for the financial years ended December 31,
2021 and 2022:

**Financial Year**
**2021** **2022**

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses increased by €3.8 million, or 13.0%, from €29.2 million for the financial
year ended December 31, 2021 to €33.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in
general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher personnel expenses as a result of higher
performance based bonuses, increased yearly average headcount and higher legal and consultancy costs. The
increase was partially offset by a decrease in expenses for external services.

The table below breaks down the general and administrative expenses for the financial years ended December 31,
2021 and 2022:

_Other Operating Income_

Other operating income remained relatively stable at €5.3 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2021
and €5.2 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Other operating income primarily relates to a
remainder of insurance compensations for property damages caused by the fire at our site in Pratteln in 2020. The
financial year ended December 31, 2021 also included €2.1 million of insurance compensation for business
interruption.

_Financial Result_

Financial result amounted to a net expense of €45.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, a
decrease of €8.2 million from a net expense of €54.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.
This effect was principally the result of a decrease in other financial expenses from €14.4 million for the financial
year ended December 31, 2021 to €4.1 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022 due to the
subsequent measurement at fair value through profit and loss of the financial instruments embedded in the Existing
Notes.

_Taxes on Income_

Taxes on income amounted to €11.0 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022 compared to taxes on
income of €2.9 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to
an increase of €8.0 million in current income taxes.

_Net Result for the Period_

Due to the factors discussed above, net result for the period significantly increased from a net loss of €20.2 million
for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 to a net profit of €17.7 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2022. Net result attributable to our shareholders significantly increased from a loss of €21.5 million
for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 to a profit of €18.6 million for the financial year ended December
31, 2022.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased year-on-year by €96.7 million or 19.6% from €492.3 million in the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 to €589.0 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2021, due to strong demand in
both our product groups in 2021 across the portfolio and supported by the reversal of temporary pressure on
caustic soda prices induced by COVID-19.

The following table shows revenue by product group and by location of customers:

**Financial Year**
**2020** **2021** **Change**
**in € million** **(%)**
**Revenue by product group**
Exclusives and Specialties .............................................................. 312.2 367.3 17.6%

North America ................................................................................ 55.0 75.7 37.6%
Rest of World .................................................................................. 53.3 79.1 48.4%
**Revenue from external customers ...............................................** **492.3** **589.0** **19.6%**

Revenue of the Exclusives and Specialties product group increased by €55.1 million or 17.6% from €312.2 million
in the financial year ended December 31, 2020 to €367.3 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2021,
driven by a strong demand from our agrochemical customers for Exclusives. The strong revenue growth was both
driven by higher volumes and by positive pricing effects, as increased raw material prices were partially passed
on to our customers. Revenue of Specialties increased, driven by positive pricing effects and a continued strong
demand for high-value products in regulated markets, such as pharmaceutical, personal care, food and animal feed
as well as automotive, aerospace and agrochemical industries.

In 2020, a fire incident at our Pratteln site led to a partial standstill of the chlorine value chain, which negatively
impacted our revenues in both product groups. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a temporary
decline in the price for caustic soda, resulting in temporarily lower 2020 revenues. Adjusted for the impact of the
Pratteln site fire incident, all our product groups still experienced strong growth: in our Exclusives and Specialties
product group the strong growth of 17.6% resulted from project wins and strong demand for our existing portfolio
of products, growth in innovative niche specialties products and overall very resilient demand in Crop and Life
sciences, while Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals exhibited a 23.1% year-on-year growth in revenue
which was principally due to the start of the caustic soda price recovery, continued successful partial pass-through
of a certain portion of raw material price increases to customers and a largely stable volume development and, for
some Specialties and Advanced Intermediates, the need for Western suppliers to de-risk supply chains.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by €70.8 million, or 18.1%, from €390.2 million for the financial year ended December
31, 2020 to €461.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. As a percentage of revenues, cost of
sales amounted to 79.3% of our revenues in the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and 78.3% of our
revenues in the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The table below breaks down the cost of sales for the
financial years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:

**Financial Year**
**2020** **2021** **Change**
**in € million** **(%)**

Costs of raw materials and supplies ................................................ 157.6 216.5 37.4%
Personnel expenses ......................................................................... 87.9 93.7 6.6%
Energy costs .................................................................................... 35.1 41.3 17.7%
Depreciation and amortization ........................................................ 51.8 50.8 (1.9)%
Repair and maintenance expenses ................................................... 20.8 21.4 2.9%
External services ............................................................................. 16.1 16.0 (0.6)%
Other ............................................................................................... 20.9 21.3 1.9%
**Cost of sales ...................................................................................** **390.2** **461.0** **18.1%**

The main driver for our cost of sales were costs of raw materials and suppliers which increased from €157.6
million in the financial year ended December 31, 2020 by 37.4% to €216.5 million in the financial year ended
December 31, 2021 mainly because of raw material price increases, which, however, could be partially passed on
to customers. In addition, a 17.7% increase in our energy costs resulted in an increase of cost of sales.

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by €25.9 million, or 25.4%, from €102.1 million for the financial year ended December 31,
2020 to €128.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strong top-line growth
amid higher volumes from new project wins and strong demand in our existing portfolio.

_Research and Development Expenses_

Research and development expenses remained relatively stable at €4.1 million in the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 and €3.9 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2021. We continued our principal
investments in our existing product portfolio and processes. The reduction was principally caused by lower

depreciation and amortization, while our personnel expenses and expenses for external services for research and
development expenses remained relatively stable. The table below breaks down the research and development
expenses for the financial years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:

_Distribution and Logistics Expenses_

Distribution and logistics expenses increased by €1.6 million, or 2.6%, from €61.8 million for the financial year
ended December 31, 2020 to €63.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in
distribution and logistics expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in transport costs reflecting a general
increase in costs for transports in 2021. The table below breaks down the distribution and logistics expenses for
the financial years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:

**Financial Year**
**2020** **2021**

**Distribution and logistics expenses .................................................................** **61.8** **63.4**

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses increased by €5.2 million, or 21.7%, from €24.0 million for the financial
year ended December 31, 2020 to €29.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in
general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher personnel expenses as a result of wage increases
and hiring, higher legal and consultancy costs, a sale of the Group and higher insurance premiums. The table
below breaks down the general and administrative expenses for the financial years ended December 31, 2020 and
2021:

**Financial Year**
**2020** **2021**
**in € million**

**General and administrative expenses .............................................................** **24.0** **29.2**

_Other Operating Income_

Other income decreased from €19.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 to €5.3 million for
the financial year ended December 31, 2021. This was principally due to high business interruption insurance
compensation payments in 2020 in relation to the fire incident in our plant in Pratteln. The table below breaks
down other operating income for the financial years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021:

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses amounted to €3.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 in connection
with the fire incident in Pratteln and certain other expenses in relation to disposals of assets, while there were no
other operating expenses in the financial year ended December 31, 2021.

_Financial Result_

Financial result amounted to a net expense of €54.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021, an
increase of €9.8 million from a net expense of €44.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020. This
effect was principally the result of a significant increase in other financial expenses resulting from the subsequent
measurement at fair value through profit and loss of financial instruments embedded in the Existing Notes in 2021.

_Taxes on Income_

Taxes on income amounted to €2.9 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2021 compared to taxes on
income of €0.4 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2020. While income from deferred taxes of €5.7
million in the financial year ended December 31, 2020 was higher than current income taxes of €5.3 million, as a
result of higher profits in the financial year ended December 31, 2021, income from deferred taxes of €5.4 million
only partially offset current income taxes of €8.3 million.

_Net Result for the Period_

Due to the factors discussed above, net loss for the period increased from a net loss of €15.1 million for the
financial year ended December 31, 2020 to a net loss of €20.2 million for the financial year ended December 31,
2021. Net loss attributable to our shareholders increased from a loss of €15.2 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 to a loss of €21.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 and the net result

_______________________
(1) Reported EBITDA means net result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial results, amortization and depreciation.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA means result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial result, amortization and depreciation and
adjustments for expenses and income not related to the operational performance of the business activities, such as strategic projects,
restructuring and reorganization measures, financial impacts of natural disasters, property damage insurance compensations, as well as
valuation impacts resulting from curtailments or modifications to pension or post-retirement benefits schemes and purchase price
allocations. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a performance indicator recognized under IFRS. The EBITDA and the Adjusted
EBITDA reported is not necessarily comparable to the performance figures published by other companies as EBITDA or Adjusted
EBITDA or the like.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €34.8 million, or 27.2%, from €127.8 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2021 to €162.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Historical growth in
Adjusted EBITDA was driven by favorable market conditions and a continued strong demand across both product
groups in 2022, in particular due to an increase in pricing resulting in a higher margin for our products from
customers in our Exclusives and Specialties business as well as positive pricing effects in our Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals business.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €14.9 million, or 13.2%, from €112.9 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 to €127.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The growth in Adjusted
EBITDA was driven by resilient top-line growth and new product introductions, paired with shift to higher margin
Exclusives and Specialties business, our ability to partially pass on raw material prices efficiently and substantial
benefits from operating leverage as we focus on efficient plant and overhead management. The strong growth in
Adjusted EBITDA was achieved despite supply chain disruptions in early 2021.

In the first half of the financial year 2021, the Group’s performance was negatively affected by extreme winter
weather conditions in the Gulf coast area in the U.S., impacting the business operations of our raw material
suppliers. These suppliers were forced to declare the occurrence of a force majeure event for various products
such as, for example, Acetic Acid. This resulted in a loss of already contracted business (purchase orders), which
was not compensated by insurance and was normalized as part of non-recurring items.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our principal sources of funds have been cash generated from our operating activities, borrowings under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and sale of receivables under the Securitization Program and the
Factoring Program. Our principal uses of cash are for capital expenditures, to fund debt service obligations and
for working capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of €69.9 million.

Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be our operating cash flows. We will also
have access to the New Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital and general corporate needs. The
continued availability of the New Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon certain conditions as described
further under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement.” In
addition, our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which, in turn, depends to
some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
See “Risk Factors.”

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with available borrowings
under the New Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs,
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future
debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including
the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

**_Financial Year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the Financial Year ended December 31, 2022_**

_Cash Flow from Operating Activities_

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €54.3 million from €96.4 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2021 to €150.7 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily
due to the significant increase in Reported EBITDA. Furthermore, despite rising raw material and energy prices,
net working capital increased at a slower rate than in the previous period.

_Cash Flow from Investing Activities_

Cash flow used in investing activities increased by €4.2 million from €67.3 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2021 to €71.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily
due to investments into measures regarding asset reliability and availability with respect to our production sites
as well as contracted growth projects, including our “Fit for Future” program.

_Cash Flow from Financing Activities_

Cash flow used in financing activities increased by €8.6 million from €42.4 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2021 to €51.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily
due to an increase in drawings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in the amount of €5.0
million and an increase in interest rates as a result of such larger amount drawn thereunder. In addition, other
financial debt decreased to a cash outflow of €2.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 resulting
from a sale of non-current assets and includes proceeds that were not passed on to other members of a consortium
until the financial year 2022.

**_Financial Year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the Financial Year ended December 31, 2021_**

_Cash Flow from Operating Activities_

Cash flow from operating activities decreased by €28.1 million from €124.5 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 to €96.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. While our Reported
EBITDA increased significantly from €110.7 million to €117.5 million as a result of strong business growth, our
working capital requirements also increased, in particular higher inventories and accounts receivables which
reduced our cash flow from operating activities year-on-year.

_Cash Flow from Investing Activities_

Cash flow used in investing activities increased by €7.5 million from €59.8 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 to €67.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was principally
due to higher investments in property, plant and equipment in 2021, in particular at the sites in Pratteln and in
Kokkola. Material investments in 2021 included maintenance, safety and reliability measures as well as the
expansion of production capacities for the Exclusives and Specialties product group, which were higher than in
2020.

_Cash Flow from Financing Activities_

Cash flow used in financing activities increased by €2.2 million from €40.1 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 to €42.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. While interest and financing
fees paid decreased from €44.3 million to €44.0 million year-on-year. In addition, we utilized our Existing
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in 2020 by €10.0 million compared to an additional utilization of only €5.0
million in 2021. This was due to higher net working capital financing needs, which increased as a result of a strong
business performance and rising raw material and energy prices. The change in other financial debt (€2.5 million)
was a result of the sale of fixed assets and reflects proceeds in 2021 which were forwarded to other members of a
consortium in 2022.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures primarily relate to maintenance projects, facility upgrades and capacity expansion
projects, optimization and de-bottlenecking. A significant portion of our yearly capex expenditure is allocated to
maintenance costs, a big proportion of which is required for our plant in Pratteln. Growth Capex accounted for
slightly more than a third of our yearly capex spend and increased as a proportion of total capex from 2020 to
2021 and has remained relatively constant as a proportion of total capex across 2021 and 2022. See “⸺Factors
_Affecting our Results of Operations⸺Capital Expenditures and Capacity Expansion.” A relatively small part of_
our capital expenditures is spent on intangible assets, including information and communications technology,
research and development.

**2020** **2021** **2022**
**in € million**
**(unaudited)**
Capex ................................................................................................ 60.0 68.6 71.6

Capital expenditures for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 were €71.6 million, a 4.4% increase, from
€68.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased
capital expenditures for measures ensuring the asset reliability and availability.

Capital expenditures for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 were €68.6 million, a 14.3% increase, from
€60.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by increased
growth capital expenditure projects as well increase Maintenance Capex spend for our production facilities.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2023 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately €65 million.

Group Net Working Capital remained relatively stable at €60.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and €59.4 million
as of December 31, 2022. Group Net Working Capital increased from €44.0 million as of December 31, 2020 to
€60.8 million as of December 31, 2021 principally due to an increase in inventories and accounts receivable, trade
while an increase in accounts payable, trade partially offset this development. Higher inventories in 2021 reflect
increased raw material prices and the build-up of buffer stock to safeguard against potential supply chain
disruptions. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2021, accounts receivable, trade increased by €25.9 million to €70.5
million and within this figure, trade receivables sold under a customer’s reverse factoring program amounted to
€11.4 million as of December 31, 2021 as compared to €9.9 million as of December 31, 2020.

We anticipate that our trade working capital requirements will vary due to changes in raw material costs and
product off-takes by customers, which affect inventory and accounts receivable levels. Trade working capital
levels typically develop in line with raw material prices, although timing factors can affect flows of capital. We
expect to fund our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations.

**_Pension and Other Obligations_**

Our provisions for pensions and similar obligations amounted to €18.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Our
reported pension provisions related to obligations to employees under pension plans. We operated various pension
schemes in accordance with the local laws and practices in the countries in which we operate. In Germany,
retirement benefits are provided under the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. Retirement
benefits for our employees in Switzerland are provided under the pension fund of CABB AG. The Swiss pension
plan is a defined contribution scheme under Swiss GAAP. Retirement benefits for our employees in Finland are
provided under the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company. Our provisions
for pensions are described in greater detail in Note 26 to our 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2022, we also had provisions for personnel obligations that amounted to €11.8 million. The
personnel obligations include short-term benefits for holiday allowances and overtime, premiums and bonus
payments, service anniversary payments, post-employment benefits and contributions to the Employers’ Liability
Insurance Association (Berufsgenossenschaft).

**_Environmental Obligations_**

As of December 31, 2022, we had provisions for environmental and rehabilitation obligations that amounted to
€1.1 million. The provision relates to expected costs of rehabilitating toxic waste sites in Switzerland as well as
waste disposal at the production location in Kokkola, Finland. The future development of environmental costs
depends on many factors including the rehabilitation method to be used, the extent of the rehabilitation measures
as well as the shares attributable to the Group and to external parties. The amount of the provision is management’s
best estimate of the future outflow of funds in connection with our environmental and rehabilitation obligations.

**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

As of December 31, 2022, we had entered into contractual obligations to acquire property, plant and equipment
in an amount of €14.8 million (as of December 31, 2021: €13.1 million) that were not recorded on our balance
sheet.

Except as described above, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably
likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or
capital resources.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures on Market Risk**

For a detailed description of our quantitative and qualitative description of market assessments of our financial
instruments and our financial risk management, see Note 35 to our 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

Our preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions,
undertake estimates and exercise judgment that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the balance
sheet date and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the financial period. See Note 3 to our 2022
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. All assumptions, expectations and forecasts used as a basis for certain
estimates within the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements represent good-faith assessments of our future
performance for which management believes there is a reasonable basis. Estimates and judgments used in the
determination of reported results are continuously evaluated.

Assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill in the amount of €199.2 million is recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position for the
financial year ended December 31, 2022. Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test at on the basis of cashgenerating units a minimum by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount.

87


-----

The goodwill impairment test is performed on the basis of cash-generating units (CGUs) by comparing the
recoverable amount with the carrying amount. Consistent with the internal management and reporting structure,
the following three cash generating units have been identified: (i) CDMO – Europe, (ii) CDMO – North America,
(iii) Non - CDMO. The CGUs reflect the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes. The existing goodwill was allocated to the CGUs in accordance with the purchase price
allocation in 2014 for the CGU CDMO – Europe and the CGU Non – CDMO resp. 2019 for the CGU CDMO –
North America.

The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is calculated based on the fair value less costs to sell
approach. The underlying cash flow projections are based on past experiences, current results and on the best
estimate of the future development of influencing factors. Market assumptions, such as the development of the
overall economy and the market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific
information sources. The required discounting of cash flows for impairment testing is calculated using the
weighted average cost of capital rate after tax, which is determined using the capital asset pricing model. It
comprises a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective
industry-specific peer group. The fair value measurement was categorized as a level 3 fair value. The financial
projections were approved by management and consist of a detailed planning period of five years.

The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2022. The recoverable amount of all CGU’s exceed
their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2021. No goodwill impairment was
indicated. See Note 18 to our 2022 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets_**

As of December 31, 2022, we had intangible assets (excluding goodwill) with a balance sheet value of €95.2
million and property, plant and equipment with a balance sheet value of €578.9 million. Intangible assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not
be recoverable. Property, plant and equipment are tested annually for indications of impairment. If any such
indication exists, estimates of the expected future cash flows from the utilization and potential disposal of these
assets are made in order to assessing the impairment. The actual cash flows may differ significantly from the
discounted future cash flows which are based on these estimates. Factors such as a change in the planned
utilization of buildings, machinery and equipment, technical ageing or utilization levels of installations which are
lower than original forecasts may reduce the useful service life or may result in an impairment.

**_Pension provisions_**

As of December 31, 2022, we reported provisions of €18.1 million for pensions and similar obligations. The
valuation of these pension provisions is influenced by assumptions regarding the future development of wages
and salaries or pensions as well as interest rates.

In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG.
The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension fund of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The
retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd. The
calculations of the assets and liabilities recognized with regard to these facilities are based on statistical and
actuarial calculations. In particular, the present value of the defined benefit obligation depends on assumptions
such as the discount rate and the pension growth rate used for calculating the present value of the future pension
obligations. Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation
of the present value of future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by us also use
statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions.

The discount rate for the actuarial calculations of the German and Finnish defined benefit obligations was
determined by applying the Mercer Pension Yield Curve Approach (MYC). The data and methodology used to
create the MYC is reviewed periodically by Mercer to ensure consistency and improved estimates.

**_Environmental provisions_**

Provisions for environment and rehabilitation relate to the responsibility of the Group in relation to the cost of
asbestos remediation and the rehabilitating of certain legacy issues. The rehabilitation costs are borne by the major
waste contributors of the past, whereby the share of CABB AG is defined in accordance with a fixed distribution
key. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of management for the future outflow of funds in connection
with the rehabilitation obligations. Although the estimations and assumptions are regularly reviewed and updated,
the actual outcome can significantly differ from the current best estimate. The rehabilitation of the largest landfill

-----

site is completed, which leads to the next phase of renaturation of the site. Thus, it is possible that additional costs
may occur which exceed the recognized provisions. As of December 31, 2022, we had recognized environmental
provisions in the amount of €1.1 million.

**_Deferred tax assets_**

Accruals for deferred taxes are recognized for tax losses carried forward. The recognition of deferred tax assets
on tax losses carried forward requires management estimates to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits
will be available against which the losses can by utilized. If there is doubt regarding the extent to which the tax
loss carry-forwards can be realized, appropriate impairments are recognized in relation to the deferred tax assets
as required.

**Recently Adopted Accounting Regulations**

With effect from January 1, 2022, we applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations published
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union. The amendments
had no material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations:

- Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37 Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020. The
amendments to IFRS include an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards.
Furthermore, an additional provision was added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer must apply the provisions
from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when identifying assumed liabilities within
the scope of these standards.

- The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items produced
while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognized with the associated
costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not permissible.

- The amendments to IAS 37 specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a
contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments apply for annual
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 to contracts existing at the date when the amendments
are first applied. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments is
recognized as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity, as
appropriate. The comparatives are not restated.

- The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments,
whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and vice versa are to be
included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities. Costs or fees paid to other
third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 41 Agriculture, and to the explanatory
examples of IFRS 16 Leases.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Our three main end-markets: (i) Crop Science, (ii) Life Science and (iii) Performance Materials, which we serve
with our offering across product groups, benefit from several persistent and structural long-term mega-trends.

**Crop Science**

**_General_**

Crop Science products mainly comprise three key product segments, (1) herbicides, (2) insecticides and (3)
fungicides, which are applied to improve crop yields and increase efficiency of crop production for products such
as corn, wheat or soybeans. In 2022, total revenue of the underlying global Crop Science market amounted to
€69.6 billion, growing at a CAGR of 7.8% from €55.6 billion in 2019 (Roland Berger Report).

Out of the approximately €70 billion Crop Science market, active ingredients (including advanced intermediates)
manufacturing accounted for approximately €13-17 billion. Active ingredients refer to the chemical compound
that is used in the final crop protection product and achieves the desired counteractive properties against pests,
such as weeds, insects and fungi, among other organisms. Active ingredients manufacturing refers to a multi-step
manufacturing process of the key chemical ingredient within crop protection products that imparts the biological
activity to the crop protection products. Within the active ingredient manufacturing market, around 40-50% of the
production is outsourced to CDMOs such as us, implying a total addressable Crop Science CDMO market for the
CABB Group (“CABB”) of approximately €6.5-7.0 billion in 2022 (Roland Berger Report). See “⸺Crop
_Science⸺CDMO.”_

**_Key Drivers_**

Demand for crop protection products is primarily driven by farmer demand. Increasing demand is expected due
to two underlying long-term mega-trends, which overall positively affect the Crop Science market: (1) the growing
population and rising middle class; and (2) decreasing arable land per capita. Population growth and the
consequent increase in food demand, which, taken with the reduction in arable land per capita available, will drive
a strong need for more efficient, higher-priced innovative crop protection products capable of improving farmland yields on available areas (Roland Berger Report).

_Growing population and rising middle class_

Growing global population leads to an increased demand for food and crops. Additionally, a higher caloric intake
per capita and a fast-growing global middle class also positively impact the future demand for food supply. The
total world population is expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.9% from approximately 7.8 billion in 2020 to 8.5
billion in 2030, down from a slightly higher CAGR of 1.2% between 2000 and 2020 (Roland Berger Report). The
global middle class population (i.e., households with per capita income between US$10 and US$100 per person
per day) drives a stronger demand for food and crops and has grown at a CAGR of 4.4%, from 3.0 billion in 2015
to 3.8 billion in 2020. Forecasts predict a further CAGR of 3.7% from 2020 to 2030 (Roland Berger Report).

1) Defined as households with per capita incomes between USD 10 and USD 100 per person per day (pppd) in 2005 PPP terms

_Decreasing arable land per capita_

Although arable land has grown slightly in absolute terms, it has decreased in relation to the increasing global
population. Available hectares per capita have declined at a rate of -1.1% CAGR from 2000 to 2020 (Roland
Berger Report). As a result, achieving target crop yields per hectare within available areas to support an increasing
population requires greater efficiency in crop protection, which fosters the need for efficient Crop Science
products (Roland Berger Report).

_Increased prices for crop commodities since 2020_

Prices of crop commodities are a major factor for the Crop Science market, since high (or low) trading prices
generally lead to increased (or reduced) farmer income, and as a result increase (or decrease) farmers’ ability to
spend on Crop Science products. Furthermore, farmers are increasingly using tools such as digital monitoring of
crop areas, which allows them to use more precise, accurate and sophisticated Crop Science products (e.g., small
batches and/or targeted applications) to enhance their crop yields. After a long period of stagnation, the prices of

91


-----

crop commodities surged in the second half of 2020 due to increased demand and supply imbalance caused by
strong demand from China, unfavorable weather conditions and COVID-19, which led to supply chain
interruptions. Similarly, prices have sharply increased in the first half of 2022 as a result of the energy crisis and
the overall inflationary environment among other factors. At the end of 2022, prices had decreased slightly but
still remained at high levels. Further, because Russia and Ukraine are major producers and exporters of crops, the
Russia/Ukraine war has led to a crop supply reduction, which subsequently created a need for higher yields in
other countries and drove up crop protection prices. However, the Russia/Ukraine war appears to have had a very
limited impact on volumes in the Crop Science market as both countries accounted for less than 5% of the total
market value for 2022 (Roland Berger Report).

Driven by the foregoing trends, the underlying Crop Science market is expected to experience long-term growth
of approximately 2% CAGR until 2027, ultimately reaching approximately €77 billion (Roland Berger Report).

**_CDMO_**

_General_

The Crop Science CDMO market, which is the key addressable market relevant to CABB, is expected to grow
faster than the general Crop Science market. Crop Science CDMO players serve as an outsourcing solution for
global Crop Science companies versus the in-house development and manufacturing of crop protection products.
The decision of Crop Science players to outsource to CDMO specialists is mainly driven by three factors: (1)
technical expertise; (2) capacity availability; and (3) cost considerations and capital expenditure requirements
(Roland Berger Report), which are further detailed below under “—Key Drivers.”

Over the years, there has been an increase in outsourcing within the Crop Science industry. As of 2022,
approximately 40-50% of active ingredient production by Crop Science players was outsourced to contract
manufacturers, such as CABB. The CDMO Crop Science market represented about €6.5-7.0 billion as of 2022,
having grown at a CAGR of 9-10% between 2019 and 2022. The market is expected to further grow at a CAGR
of 4-5% until 2027 (Roland Berger Report). Due to the increasing complexity of new molecules, a lack of available
capacities in-house at clients and a high likelihood of customers engaging in cost reduction efforts, it is expected
that Crop Science players will outsource an increasing share of development and manufacturing to CDMOs
(Roland Berger Report).

92


-----

_Key Drivers_

_(1) Technical expertise_

Among the factors considered, technical expertise and know-how is one of the top decision criteria that companies
take into consideration when determining whether to outsource their production. This is explained by the rising
complexity of new active ingredient molecules. Synthesis of these molecules requires a higher number of steps,
so the production process typically requires specialist know-how. Since major Crop Science players may not
always have the complete technical expertise required, they increasingly rely on CDMO partners with an
increasing share of their production process expected to be outsourced in the future as a result (Roland Berger
Report).

_(2) Capacity availability_

Another important key decision criterion for customers when choosing their CDMO partner is suitable capacity
availability. Crop Science players do not always have excess capacity to cover growing product demand and
consequently rely increasingly on CDMO partners. As major Crop Science players look to outsource their
production activities, the ability for CDMOs to offer sufficient fit-for-purpose production capacity as well as
flexibility for further expansion is critical (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

_(3) Cost considerations and capex requirements_

The increasing complexity of molecules, more stringent regulatory trends and fast-evolving customer demand
patterns mean that major Crop Science players must focus increasingly on research and development, regulatory
and marketing activities, and thereby less on growing in-house manufacturing. Against this backdrop, Crop
Science players are focused on ensuring cost and capex discipline with regard to production activities, which
supports their decision to outsource production to CDMOs (Roland Berger Report).

_CDMO Globally_

The CDMO market is expected to grow by a CAGR of 4-5% across geographies, with India as key growth driver
and decent growth in Europe at a CAGR of 2-4%, given the different growth dynamics in various locations.
Below is a list of geographies in terms of the location of production for the CDMO market. On a regional level,
Europe accounted for 20-25% of market value in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2-4% until 2027,
primarily driven by the introduction of and increasing demand for new proprietary and complex active ingredients.
Europe is home to three of the global Crop Science majors and a strong foothold in the region ensures customer
proximity. India is the largest market, accounting for approximately 35-40% of the global Crop Science CDMO
market. While outsourcing to China has grown substantially over the last decade, increasing competition from
India and concerns over security of supply are expected to limit growth going forward. India is the key historic
and future growth driver and is expected to capture a large part of the additionally outsourced production due to
strong customer relationships with major customers, high price competitiveness paired with less governmental
control compared to China and increasing manufacturing competence. Consequently, India’s Crop Science
CDMO market is expected to grow at 8-10% CAGR until 2027, compared to a 15-16% growth rate from 2019 to
2022. North America and Japan, respectively, represent 3-8% and 2-4% of the global CDMO market and are
expected to grow at a CAGR of 5-7% and 1-3%, compared to 4-5% growth each from 2019 to 2022. The North
American market is expected to benefit from, among other things, higher level of regulation and high energy
prices in Europe. However, Europe and North America still remain important markets as shown in the graphic
below (Roland Berger Report).

**_Competition_**

Key competitors (by turnover) in the European Crop Science CDMO space include: Saltigo (Germany), Arxada
(Switzerland), WeylChem Group (Germany) and ESIM (Austria). Further, there are several Asian players
including Deccan (India) and Lianhetech (China) and in North America, CABB’s Jayhawk site competes with
Viakem (Mexico) and Grace (US). (Roland Berger Report).

Saltigo and CABB are the key European players in the novel active ingredients (AIs) segment. Further, along with
Saltigo, CABB is one of the leading players in the Crop Science market in terms of technological know-how,
possessing the ability to meet customer demands on a variety of commercial levels. Further, CABB has a strong
track record and long-standing client relationships due to its strong customer centricity. CABB has a unique global
supply chain structure with CDMO sites in the U.S., Switzerland and Finland. Proximity to the headquarters of
key Crop Science players such as Syngenta, Bayer and BASF in Europe and Corteva and FMC in the U.S.
constitute an advantage for CABB in the competitive landscape. Certain players in Asia perform better from a
price perspective due to lower personnel and infrastructure costs and fewer regulatory requirements. However,
price is less important for purchase decisions, as customers typically focus on technical know-how and track
record first (Roland Berger Report).

The Crop Science CDMO market shows a broad range of growth rates depending on the year of introduction of
the respective products. Products introduced after 2010 (“Novel AIs”) experience a higher outsourcing share and
are expected to exhibit stronger growth of 10% CAGR or above from 2022 until 2027. Those Novel AIs introduced
after 2010 account for approximately 5-10% of the addressable 2022 Crop Science CDMO market. The majority
of the market value of products launched before 1990 comprises generic active ingredients (>50%) with an
established market position but also lower expected growth from 2022 to 2027 of approximately 2-3% CAGR
(Roland Berger Report).

As of 2021, CABB, Deccan, Lianhetech, Saltigo, and PI Industries combined accounted for approximately 3237% of the global Crop Science CDMO Market. Together with the remaining five top ten competitors, the top ten
players account for approximately 50-55% of the overall Crop Science CDMO market (Roland Berger Report).

In terms of the market share in the EU, the Crop Science CDMO market is concentrated, with the top five players
in total comprising an estimated market share of 70-75% in 2021. More specifically, Saltigo represented 23-28%
of the market share, CABB 17-22%, Arxada 8-13%, WeylChem 6-11%, ESIM 5-10% and other entities combined
24-29% of the overall market (Roland Berger Report).

**Life Science**

**_General_**

The Life Science industry involves companies working in areas such as personal care, nutrition and
pharmaceuticals. Within the Life Science market, CABB mainly manufactures four products: (1)
monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), which is predominantly used in personal care, e.g., bath and shower products,
but also in other items outside of the Life Sciences industry; (2) dichloroacetic acid (“DCA”) used in
pharmaceuticals, e.g., novel RNA and DNA therapeutics; (3) glycolic acid (“GA”), which is used in personal care,
e.g., skin care, and other products outside of the Life Sciences industry; and (4) ethyl-2-chloroacetoacetate
(“CAE”), which is used in food and feed, e.g., vitamins, and other products outside of the Life Sciences industry
(Roland Berger Report).

**_Key Drivers_**

Demand for Life Science ingredients is driven by the underlying demand for Life Science products, which in turn
is primarily impacted by several structural long-term trends: (1) as the global population ages, chronic diseases
and spending on pharmaceutical products are expected to rise. This is also fueled by a growing middle class
leading an increasingly sedentary lifestyle; (2) the growing middle class has resulted in corresponding growth in
disposable income and an expected increase in spending per capita on personal care products, especially antiaging solutions; (3) ongoing innovations and technological progress are enabling new therapeutic approaches and
more customized and personalized medicine that require Life Science ingredients; (4) rising prosperity in
emerging economies and rapid urbanization has corresponded with improved access to medical treatment and
solutions; and (5) rising concerns about the harmful effects of chemicals and synthetic products is shifting
consumer preference towards organic products, which may in turn decrease demand for chemical intermediates
in personal care and nutrition. Some consumers are also increasingly concerned about negative effects chemicals
may have on the environment (Roland Berger Report).

**_MCA_**

_General_

MCA is a building block in organic synthesis used in Life Sciences not only for the production of ingredients for
personal care, pharma and food products but also for industrial applications. As of 2022, the total global MCA
market represented about 1,100-1,200 ktons. Our MCA is mainly used in the Life Science industry, the Crop
Science industry and in Industrials & others. Life Science represented the largest MCA end-market as of 2022,
accounting for approximately 40-50% of the market volume. MCA has a large market volume of 520-540 ktons
focused on Life Science as of 2022, with a solid growth outlook of 4-5% CAGR (in terms of volumes in ktons)
between 2022 and 2027. In 2022, CABB was one of the largest MCA producer in terms of production capacity
installed. CABB and Nouryon are considered the leading market players in terms of security of supply and
delivering quality and high purity MCA (Roland Berger Report).

Other key competitors in this space include PCC Rokita SA (Poland) and Niacet (U.S.). In terms of supply
security, we and Nouryon are known to offer highly reliable supplies and are located in key geographic areas in
close proximity to key customers (Roland Berger Report).

_Key Drivers_

As of 2022, MCA within the Life Science market was expected to grow at a CAGR of 4-5% (in terms of volumes
in ktons) between 2022 and 2027, primarily due to the increased focus on hygiene and general health awareness.
This is driven by, among others, the following factors: (1) a higher demand for personal care products and
detergents supported by COVID-19, which is expected to positively impact the demand for MCA and betaines
(partially made up of MCA) in the long-run since they are essential ingredients in producing these personal care
products; (2) within consumer products in emerging markets, an increasing switch from solid to liquid products,
including soap and dishwashing detergents, which is expected to have a positive volume impact on betaines since
they are frequently used in liquid personal care products; and (3) within the food industry, an increasing trend of
adding carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a thickening agent or stabilizer in different foods and beverages. As
CMC production requires MCA as ingredient, MCA demand is expected to correspondingly benefit. While
volumes are expected to grow moderately overall, driven by the aforementioned market-trends, prices are
expected to decline after a peak in 2022 because MCA price is strongly linked to commoditized raw material
prices, and input costs are typically passed through to customers (Roland Berger Report).

_MCA Esters_

As of 2022, the global Life Science MMCA and EMCA markets are expected to grow in value by around 4-5%
CAGR between 2024 and 2027, following a period of moderate growth or stagnation from 2023 to 2024 and a
decline in 2023 due to normalization of energy prices. The underlying volume growth can largely be attributed to
growing demand from all end-markets, i.e., food supplements (vitamin A), pharma (contrast agents and piracetam)
and the flavor and fragrances industry (Roland Berger Report). We convert MCA to MCA esters, i.e.
methylmonochloroacetate (MMCA) and ethylmonochloroacetate (EMCA), with applications such as producing
contrast agents, vitamins and other drugs such as the anti-dementia drug Piracetam.

**_DCA_**

_General_

DCA is a chemical compound predominantly used as a crucial component in the oligonucleotide synthesis process
for next-gen RNA-based therapeutics in pharmaceuticals. It is an essential ingredient in the key process step
(detritylation) of siRNA through oligonucleotide synthesis and for the chemical synthesis of DNA templates used
to produce mRNA drugs. DCA is the ideal reagent in this process given its purity, acid strength and ease of use.
The end-use applications of oligonucleotide-based drugs are in genetic diseases and next-gen cancer treatments
(Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

Historically, DCA experienced a growth of more than 100% CAGR between 2019 and 2022. DCA is a niche
market with €15-20 million in market value as of 2022, and with an estimated market value CAGR of 20% to
65% between 2022 and 2027 (depending upon underlying assumptions, specifically on the performance of the
key commercial product on the market). Overall, the pure DCA market is expected to outgrow the underlying
market for oligonucleotide-based drugs, as DCA is a main component of blockbuster products as well as other
promising drugs in the research and development pipeline. In a conservative case, the DCA market is expected to
grow at a CAGR of approximately 20-30% until 2027, assuming limited contributions from the key commercial
product and new blockbuster drugs as well as some price decline. In an optimistic case, assuming key product
sales grow according to global data forecasts, non-blockbuster product sales develop in line with the
oligonucleotide synthesis market (approximately 15% CAGR), and that the blockbuster drugs currently reach
commercial launch, the DCA market could grow at a CAGR of up to 60-70%, in a scenario that assumes no price
decline (Roland Berger Report).

-----

Key competitors in this space include Hongene, a Chinese DCA producer with limited footprint in Europe and
other Chinese players that produce DCA but focus on lower purity products. Due to the complexity of producing
high purity DCA, other Chinese players besides Hongene are predominantly focused on a lower quality and lower
purity level of production than CABB. As a result, European and U.S. distributors typically do not partner with
other Chinese manufacturers apart from Hongene due to current quality & purity profiles as of 2022 (Roland
Berger Report).

_Key Drivers_

The underlying oligonucleotide synthesis market is expected to grow significantly, primarily driven by research
and development investments and innovations. Specifically, growth in the oligonucleotide synthesis market is
expected to be driven by (1) increased government funding and research efforts to improve genomic technologies
(e.g., DNA sequencing) and develop oligonucleotide-based drugs, as well as growing demand for synthesized
oligos for use in several pharmaceutical companies’ pipeline drugs; and (2) a broadening field of applications
stemming from technical advancements that are expected to further increase importance of oligonucleotide-based
drugs (Roland Berger Report).

The DCA market is expected to outgrow the oligonucleotide synthesis market, as it is a key input of already
marketed and potentially upcoming “blockbuster” drugs (Roland Berger Report). Key drivers include: (1) CDMOs
increasing production capacity to meet growing demand from customers along with expected increases in endmarket demand for existing oligonucleotide-based drugs as they receive approvals from regulatory bodies and
reimbursement is improved; and (2) ongoing innovation in connection to oligonucleotide-based drugs leading to
the discovery of new treatments requiring DCA as raw material for their synthesis in addition to ongoing
investigation into DCA given directly as a treatment (e.g., as possible treatment for endometriosis) that will likely
lead to new areas of application and increase demand (Roland Berger Report).

**_Glycolic Acid (GA)_**

_General_

GA with ultra-high purity profiles is primarily used in skin care for various lotions and peeling products (e.g.,
anti-aging creams, facial cleansers, etc.). In 2022, GA had a market value of €50-60 million with a moderate
expected growth outlook of 3-6% CAGR between 2022 and 2027. Skin care was the largest application of GA,
accounting for around 55-65% of the overall market in 2022 and is expected to grow at a market value CAGR of
3-6% CAGR from 2022-2027. Key competitors in this space included Chemours (US), CrossChem (US) and a
number of Chinese and Indian players focused on the lower end of the quality spectrum. Chemours is the only
player that manufactures products of similar quality to those of CABB (Roland Berger Report).

_Key Drivers_

Overall, the glycolic acid market is expected to experience moderate growth until 2027, driven by usage in
personal care products, growing by 3-4% CAGR from 2022-2025 and 4-6% CAGR from 2025 to 2027. The key
drivers include: (1) rising adoption of skin care products utilizing GA as ingredient (e.g., anti-aging products) due
to its superior properties related to water holding capacity, skin hydration and skin turgor/acne removal, for which
no organic substitutes have been identified as of today; (2) growing importance of personal appearance and related
beauty products, especially in emerging markets; many products containing glycolic acid, such as moisturizers,
cleansers, acne treatment and skin lightening treatments, are in high demand; and (3) new care product
developments of (large) personal care brand owners/product manufacturers as GA remains one of the key
ingredients, especially for removal of old skin particles and skin moisturizing (Roland Berger Report).

**_CAE_**

_General_

CAE is typically a by-product from, e.g., chlorination processes and serves as a building block that can be used
in a variety of rather niche synthesis steps and has various applications. Vitamin production using CAE (CMO
process) is located in Europe while players in APAC typically use the EMO process. In the pharmaceutical sector,
CAE is used as a building block for APIs, e.g., in Cimetidine for treating GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease)
and in other molecules used to treat diseases of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. CAE is
valued for its reactiveness and the high yields it produces (Roland Berger Report).

97


-----

The non-captive CAE market remains a niche market in Life Sciences with a market value of €15-20 million as
of 2022 and an expected growth outlook of 3-4% CAGR between 2022 and 2027 (Roland Berger Report).

It is estimated that 50-60% of the companies that require CAE produce it in-house. CAE is typically created as a
by-product of other production processes, such as chlorination. As of 2022, the expected growth projection for
CAE used in vitamins was a market value CAGR of 3-4% until 2027. Key competitors in this space include
Wacker Chemie AG (or Wacker) (Germany) and certain Asian players, such as Sinochem (China). In terms of the
end-customers’ key purchasing criteria, including customer relationships and price, there were small differences
between the major market players CABB and Wacker, and both were clearly ahead of Asian competition by all
metrics except pricing. CABB is focused on the high purity segment in which delivery reliability and price are the
most important purchasing criteria (Roland Berger Report).

_Key Drivers_

As stated above, as of 2022, the expected growth projection for CAE used as the building blocks for vitamins is
3-4% CAGR until 2027, primarily driven by the following factors: (1) rapidly developing personalized and
functional nutrition as consumer and societal expectations are set to move beyond taste and texture and awareness
of the importance of a quality nutritional profile grows. Vitamins can improve the nutritional value of both meat
and dairy alternatives. Demand is also being driven by (2) the increasing use of feed fortification since farm
animals remain an important part of the nutrition of a growing global population. Feed fortification through the
addition of vitamins can improve the lifetime performance of farm animals through benefits related to animal
health and digestion by extracting more value from the feed. Lastly, (3) a growing incidence of vitamin deficiency
observed in patients with certain diseases and an increased prevalence of these diseases is expected to augment
market growth for certain vitamins such as vitamin B6 to address autoimmune, kidney and liver diseases (Roland
Berger Report).

**Performance Materials**

**_Specialty Anhydrides_**

_General_

Within the Performance Materials market, we supply specialty anhydrides (including benzophenone
tetracarboxylic-dianhydride (BTDA), hexafluoroispropylidene diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) and electronic
performance materials (one product) to our customers. BTDA and 6FDA are used in the electronics, infrastructure
and transportation sub-markets and, more specifically, can be used as a co-monomer for preparation of polyimide
thin films used within electrical insulation and hot-gas filtration. The Electronic Performance Materials Product
are used in semi-conductors and in the laboratory space for diagnostic purposes (Roland Berger Report, Company
Information).

As of 2022, specialty anhydrides represented a global value of €180-200 million. BTDA and 6FDA constitute a
significant share of the specialty anhydrides market. All specialty anhydrides are high-value products that are
supplied into niche markets. The BTDA market is expected to grow from €25-35 million market value at a CAGR
of 3-5% until 2027 and the 6FDA market is expected to grow from €30-40 million market value at 7-8% CAGR
until 2027 (Roland Berger Report).

_Key Drivers_

The specialty anhydrides market is expected to continue growth from 2022 to 2027. Such growth is driven by
higher demand from all end markets, especially the electronics end-market due to the following drivers: (1)
growing volumes of newly purchased smart devices like phones and tablet computers, which in turn drive demand
for BTDA-based polyimide films used for electrical insulation in smart devices; (2) the expected global switch to
5G infrastructure will likely also drive the increased demand for dianhydrides like BTDA and 6FDA which are
used for polyimide-based flexible films in 5G circuitry; (3) the bioprocessing market is growing dynamically, and
thus so is 6FDA which is used for hollow fiber membranes within the single-use equipment for chemical
separation in highly acidic environments that is gaining share over previously used stainless steel equipment; (4)
the superior properties of polyimide fibers that make them an appealing material in hot-gas filtration, e.g., in waste
incineration and cement production, which is expected to experience high single-digit growth, driven by more
stringent environmental regulation, standards for flue gas filtration and CO2 reduction requirements; and (5)
growth within the transportation industry is expected to lead to increased demand for dianhydrides, as they are
used for the thermal insulation of aircraft engines and marine vessels. Although the relevant aerospace market
declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic, continuous recovery is expected until 2027 (Roland Berger Report).

**_Electronic Performance Materials Product_**

_General_

One of CABB’s products in Performance Materials which is exclusively manufactured for one customer (the
“Electronic Performance Materials Product”) is used in semiconductor production as well as in laboratory and
diagnostics applications.

As of 2022, the addressable market for the Electronic Performance Materials Product had a market value of around
approximately €80-100 million. The vast majority of this market value is represented by application in the
semiconductor industry where the Electronic Performance Materials Product is used as a plating and surface
treatment agent before the chemical vapor deposition process. The remaining portion of the addressable market
for the Electronic Performance Materials Product is represented by applications in the laboratory and diagnostics
space, where they are used for the calibration of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of organic
solvents. Overall, the addressable market for the Electronic Performance Materials Product is expected to benefit
from a growing demand for semiconductors and NMR spectroscopy (Roland Berger Report).

_Key Drivers_

As of 2022, the addressable market for the Electronic Performance Materials Product is expected to experience
strong growth of 8-10% CAGR until 2027, driven by the growing demand in the semiconductor industry and
increased use of NMR spectroscopy due to the following key factors: (1) demand for consumer electronics such
as mobile communication devices and smart watches is increasing alongside a global rise in household income

99


-----

with semiconductors being an integral part of consumer electronics; (2) electrification and growing digital
solutions within the automotive industry are expected to contribute to an increased demand for the Electronic
Performance Materials Product, driven by trends in autonomous driving technology such as driver assistance tools
and digital connectivity; (3) the rise of artificial intelligence applications in various products requiring strong
computational power for data processing, leading to an increasing demand for powerful semiconductor-enabled
hardware; (4) increasing digital connectivity driven by the Internet of Things and 5G expansion will drive
semiconductor demand; and (5) increasing research and development activities in the area of pharmaceuticals,
biotechnology, agriculture, and nutrition which in turn increase the necessity of molecule identification and
structure and composition analysis with the aid of NMR spectroscopy requiring the Electronic Performance
Materials Product in the calibration of organic solvents (Roland Berger Report).

**_Sodium Hydroxide_**

We also provide sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) in our sites in Gersthofen and Pratteln and are the only producer
in Switzerland offering logistic advantages. Caustic soda is used in production of various intermediate products
as well as a wide range of end applications such as in chemicals, pulp and paper, and alumina, among others. For
example, it is used in the base feedstock for the production of various chemicals as well as in the pulping of wood
for paper production or regenerated fibers. Sodium hydroxide is also used in the water treatment process. The
volume demand for sodium hydroxide is therefore closely related to GDP development (Roland Berger Report,
Company Information).

Sodium hydroxide is a by-product of chlorine production. This allows chlorine producers to recycle the chlorine
they produce and monetize it. As it is highly commoditized, the supply chains of sodium hydroxide are relatively
short and as a result, our target market for sodium hydroxide remains mainly in Europe (Roland Berger Report,
Company Information).

Overall, the sodium hydroxide market is expected to experience positive volume growth from 2022 to 2027, and
is used in numerous end-markets, such as automotive, textile, pulp and paper and household cleaners. The price
of sodium hydroxide, on the other hand, is historically volatile and difficult to predict due to its dependency on
chlorine production and energy prices. Key indicators point towards a slight decline in 2023 and subsequent years,
though price is expected to remain above 2021 levels. For example, PVC consumption, which is the main driver
of the supply of caustic soda, is expected to grow by approximately 1% or less until 2026. Electricity price, which
is a driver of production cost, started to drop towards the end of 2022 and is expected to drop further in 2024,
though it is expected to remain higher than pre-COVID-19. Specifically, pricing of caustic soda reached an alltime high in 2022 with a yearly average of €765/t (WE spot rate), compared to a five-year average of €402/t for
2017-2022 and an average of €260/t for 2020-2021. Caustic soda prices are expected to decrease to the level of
€550-700/t in 2023, and then normalize at a longer-term average of €400-600/t from 2024 onwards (Roland Berger
Report, Company Information).

**OUR BUSINESS**

**Business Overview**

We are a leading CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) and fine chemistry manufacturer
with global operations, supplying customized ingredients to major players in the Western Crop Science market,
as well as high purity and high-complexity chemical ingredients to customers in the Life Science and Performance
Material markets. Our strong technology portfolio, technical know-how and execution capabilities allow us to
cover a wide spectrum of highly specialized customer needs, specifications and complexity profiles.

Headquartered in Germany, we operate a global network with six production facilities located in Pratteln
(Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland), Galena (Kansas, United States), Gersthofen (Germany), Knapsack (Germany)
and Jining, Shandong Province (China).

Our varied product portfolio is organized across two product groups: (i) Exclusives (tailor-made active ingredients
and precursors developed for individual customers on an exclusive basis (our CDMO offering)) and Specialties
(highly specialized ingredients with applications in high-margin end-markets) products and (ii) Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals products (intermediate and base chemical products such as high purity
monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), chloroacetyl chloride (“CAC1”) and caustic soda across a large purity spectrum
with multiple end-use applications).

Our products are deeply embedded into our customers’ value chains, often on a near-exclusive basis, allowing us
to be aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination and to set up scalable manufacturing facilities
and efficient commercial production processes. The combination of our production know-how, lengthy product
development processes and contractually agreed capital expenditure contributions for some of our products
typically result in high contract renewal rates and low customer churn.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of €755.5 million and an Adjusted
EBITDA of €162.6 million (21.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin). Between 2020 and 2022, our revenue grew at
23.9% CAGR, whereas our Adjusted EBITDA grew at 20.0% CAGR. Exclusives and Specialties contributed to
56.8% of our revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 whereas Advanced Intermediates and Base
Chemicals accounted for 43.2% of our revenue for the same period.

Our products are used for end-market applications mainly in: (i) Crop Science (e.g., herbicides, fungicides,
insecticides and other livestock and crop protection products), (ii) Life Science (e.g., pharma, personal care,
nutrition, fragrances and flavor applications) and (iii) Performance Materials (e.g., curatives in epoxies,
polyimides, polyesters and other resin systems used for electronic components, semiconductors and for
composites, fibers, films, and foams that provide heat and electrical resistance). These end-markets, in particular
Crop Science, have shown resilient historical growth rates and benefit from structural mega-trends that are
expected to drive further resilient growth in the near- to mid-term, such as increasing demand for food and need
for increased farming yields on the one hand, and an aging population and improving living standards on the other.
In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the
Crop Science market, approximately 20% in the Life Science market, approximately 15% in the Performance
Materials market and approximately 15% relate to others (e.g., base chemicals and industrial MCA) (measured as
a percentage of revenues).

Exclusives, our CDMO offering, provides tailor-made active ingredients and precursors tailored to individual
customer specifications in Crop Science and are a primary contributor to our overall profitability. Based on
customer-developed IP, these products require customized production lines, expansive know-how and close
cooperation with our customers. We offer development and manufacturing services for proprietary products on
an exclusive and confidential basis to leading players in the Crop Science market such as: BASF, Bayer, Corteva
and Syngenta, and we have relationships with nearly all major players in the Western Crop Science market.

Our Specialties offering consists of specialty ingredients that leverage our considerable manufacturing expertise
to create complex chemical products that serve specific customer needs across a variety of applications in the
Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials industries. Unlike Exclusives, these products can be
offered to multiple customers at a time. Our offering highlights our excellent production capabilities and knowhow along with our ability to offer specialized technology process and development services which allows us to
continuously provide high-quality and purity products to our customers and which we believe is a key
differentiator in this field. Our Specialties products are also a strong contributor to profitability, leveraging our
close client relationship and high customer “stickiness”. In particular, we offer high value-add products for fast
101


-----

growing applications in Life Science (pharma and personal care as well as nutrition) and Performance Materials
markets (coatings, e.g., in electronics or other industrial applications), backed by several attractive long-term
customer contracts, which offer high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Customers for our
Specialties products include players such as Agilent Technologies, Bayer, Corteva, Deciem/Estee Lauder, DSM,
Evonik, Merck, Novartis and Syngenta.

In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, we offer intermediate and base chemical
products, such as MCA, CAC1 and caustic soda, that serve as chemical building blocks for other secondary
chemical processes with a variety of applications across a large number of industries and markets. We believe we
are one of the leading suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas and we operate state-of-the-art sites,
allowing us to provide a full range of purity and quality for our customers. Large parts of our Advanced
Intermediates supply agreements feature price formulas that allow us to partially pass on price increases in costs
of certain raw materials. Furthermore, we also generate a portion of our revenue from Base Chemicals and other
products such as caustic soda, that are generated as by-products from our Exclusives and Advanced Intermediates
production lines.

**Our Strengths**

**_Structurally growing end-markets and increasing outsourcing trends_**

Our underlying key end-markets (Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials) are enjoying strong and
resilient underlying growth, further supported by increasing outsourcing trends that are reinforcing demand for
our Crop Science CDMO offering.

In the financial year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated in the Crop
Science and Life Science markets (estimate based on internal company assessments), the majority of which
consists of our CDMO offering through our Exclusives products and to a smaller degree of contributions from
our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products. As a result, growth in the underlying Crop Science
and Life Science markets, specifically within CDMO products and novel advanced intermediates, represent key
growth levers for our business.

_Crop Science_

Our addressable CDMO Crop Science market grew by 9% to 10% CAGR between 2019 and 2022, outperforming
the underlying global market for Crop Science products which grew by approximately 8% CAGR during the same
period (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). Market research indicates continued growth until 2027 with
respect to both our addressable CDMO Crop Science market (4% to 5% CAGR from 2022 to 2027) and the
underlying global market for Crop Science products (2% CAGR) (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). For
more information on the specific historical and projected growth of the addressable CDMO Crop Science and
underlying global Crop Science markets, see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺General.”

The growth in the underlying global Crop Science market in particular is underpinned by the following megatrends (see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺Key Drivers” for a more detailed overview) (Roland
Berger Report, AgbioInvestor):

    - Growing population: global population growth drives demand for food and crops; and

    - Decreasing arable land: arable land per capita is decreasing, requiring efficient crop protection
products to increase farming yields.

These market dynamics are further supported by several specific trends in the addressable CDMO Crop Science
market, including (see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺Key Drivers” for a more detailed overview)
(Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor, Company Information):

    - Growth in CDMO outsourcing: customers prioritizing research and development, sales and
marketing and digitalization activities and striving to reduce their capital intensity and costs (in 2022,
approximately 40% to 50% of active ingredient production by Crop Science Players was outsourced
to CDMOs);

    - Increasing complexity of active ingredient molecules: requires specialist CDMO partners with strong
technical expertise and assets fitting into global supply chains of Crop Science players; and

    - Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements: lead to higher demand for novel active ingredients,
often outsourced to CDMOs with highly efficient multi-purpose facilities.

102


-----

Furthermore, historical demand for crop protection products has proven to be resilient to adverse events
maintaining a growth trend in spite of temporary downturns. For example, declines in average crop commodity
prices (e.g., corn, wheat, soybean) caused by events such as lower pest pressure and economic recessions in
production markets such as in Brazil, and North American weather conditions in 2019 led to a temporary downturn
in the crop protection market but were followed by year-on-year increases. Furthermore, while agrochemical
production was impacted by coronavirus-related restrictions in the first quarter of 2020, it swiftly normalized
following an easing of lockdown restrictions. While the coronavirus restrictions did impact labor availability both
in terms of production and field work, many countries deemed the agricultural sector to be of considerable
importance in maintaining food security, so restrictions on movement were less severe than in most industries
(Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

The addressable market for novel active ingredients (active ingredients introduced after 2010), a subset of the
CDMO Crop Science market, is anticipating significantly higher growth rates at a CAGR of approximately 13.7%
from 2021 to 2027, owing to, among other factors, a higher outsourcing rate due to production complexity (Roland
Berger Report). Against this background, we act as a key partner for our clients in this area, supporting innovators
with our technical expertise and state-of-the-art production facilities. Our Crop Science product portfolio benefits
from a modern set of active ingredients. We are not materially involved in the production of raw materials or
finished product for glyphosate or neonicotinoids.

_Life Science_

Our Specialty products benefit from the strong underlying growth rates in a number of attractive niche markets
for specialized Life Science applications. In 2022, the addressable Life Science market accounted for the second
largest portion of our revenue after the Crop Science market. Our products in this area consist primarily of
Advanced Intermediates products as well as Specialties products.

Our addressable Life Science markets grew between 2019 and 2022 and are expected to grow further, driven by
structural mega-trends including a global aging population and an increasing disposable income spent on personal
care, showing the strength of this segment for our future growth potential (Roland Berger Report, Company
Information). For more information on trends driving Life Sciences growth (including niche markets), see
“Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺Key Drivers.”

Individual addressable high growth sub-markets such as the oligonucleotide synthesis market (used for the
production of synthetic RNA and DNA templates) increased significantly in 2021 and 2022, and forecasts are
estimating future significant growth. See also “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺General⸺DCA.”
While this is in part due to the market’s limited current size, it also highlights how we may be able to leverage
our technical excellence to capitalize on developing demand for high-purity ingredients. For example, we are the
global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNAbased medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022).
Furthermore, DCA applications in the production of synthetic RNA and DNA templates have wider uses in the
Life Sciences industry than COVID-19 applications (where mostly enzymatic synthesis is employed), so our
product has only some commercial exposure to the trends driving COVID-19 vaccines and will benefit from
growing end markets due to both increased investments into research and development (e.g. improvement of
genomic technologies) as well as broader commercial use (e.g. “oligonucleotide therapeutics”), see “Industry and
_Market Data⸺Life Science⸺DCA⸺Key Drivers” (Roland Berger Report, Company Information)._

_Performance Materials_

Our Specialties products with niche applications benefit from attractive market dynamics in addressable endmarkets in the Performance Materials segment, BTDA, 6FDA and other markets, which are expected to grow
until 2027 (Roland Berger Report). For more information on projected growth rates, see “Industry and Market
_Data⸺Performance Materials⸺Specialty Anhydrides⸺General and “Industry and Market Data⸺Performance_
_Materials⸺Electronic Performance Materials Product⸺General.”_

Our BTDA and 6FDA products are used for numerous applications in electronics, infrastructure and transportation
and benefit from favorable macro trends in these sectors, such as growth in smart devices, the switch to 5G
infrastructure and higher government and industry spending on infrastructure. Our electronic performance
materials product is primarily used in the semiconductor industry, which fundamentally benefits from (i) the
introduction of new generation semiconductors, (ii) increasing electrification (e.g., autonomous driving and digital
connectivity) and (iii) the rise of artificial intelligence enabled by semiconductors (Roland Berger Report).

**_Leading Crop Science CDMO and Differentiated Life Science Ingredients Player with Global Presence_**

We are a leading player in the Western Crop Science CDMO market, serving major global agrochemicals
companies and holding strategic supplier status with some of the largest European-based Crop Science companies
for their agrochemicals business. We are among the top two Western CDMO players in the Crop Science market
(by Crop Science CDMO revenue as of 2021). We have a strong focus on novel active ingredients, directly
competing with only a select number of other Tier 1 players that are able to serve this segment. We are wellpositioned within the top five players globally in the Crop Science market (measured by Crop Science CDMO
revenue as of 2021) due to strong customer relationships, diverse and unique asset footprint and technical knowhow (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

We also have a significant presence in the Life Science market, providing customized products in segments such
as novel RNA therapeutics, vitamins and supplements, and anti-aging and personal care and hold leading positions
in the markets for European MCA supply, high purity DCA, as well as CAE manufacturing and cosmetic grade
GA in Life Science: We are one of the largest European Life Science MCA suppliers (by production volume in
Europe as of 2022). We are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade
DCA (a key ingredient for RNA-based medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity
DCA revenue as of 2022) (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). In cosmetic grade GA, we are globally
the second largest supplier (measured by revenue as of 2022) and the only European producer with global coverage
(Company assessment based on Roland Berger Report).

Our customized products are highly integrated in our key customers’ value chains (sometimes protected by “key
supplier” relationships for major products), and we are closely aligned in demand planning and coordination. We
have flexible multi-purpose contract manufacturing plants that allow for optimized downtimes between different
product campaigns and change-overs. Furthermore, we benefit from six well-invested sites across the globe
offering reliability, safety and high product quality. As a result, we have developed a strong reputation of reliable
performance in delivering innovative products in large quantities to our clients. We also operate a global site
network with assets spanning the U.S., Europe and China, which we believe is unique among Tier 1 Crop Science
CDMOs.

**_Longstanding, Trusted Relationships with Diversified, Blue-Chip Customer Base_**

We have long-standing relationships with most of our blue-chip customers. We are a trusted partner to major
players in the Crop Science market and numerous leading specialties companies in the Life Science and
Performance Materials markets rely on our solutions and significant expertise for their products and applications.
High customer retention rates serve as a competitive moat against new entrants: For example, in 2021 and 2022,
we had an overall average customer retention rate of approximately 98% (based on existing customer revenue
over total revenue for the respective year), which illustrates, together with the high rate of contract renewal and
lock-in effects, the “stickiness” of our topline in Exclusives.

Our average duration of business relationships with our top four customers in Crop Science exceeds 15 years in
tenure (based on management estimates between 2020 and 2022) and a number of our Crop Science blue-chip
relationships span more than 30 years (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). Together with the high
revenue visibility that most of our longer-term contracts in Exclusives provide, our customers’ long-term
commitments are supported by a track record of co-investments in production facilities through upfront capital
expenditure or top-up pricing over the term of the contract. We supply a multitude of individual products to our
top customers, which we believe indicates our customers’ trust in our capabilities and the quality of our varied
products. In 2021 and 2022, we supplied more than 10 products for each of our top three customers.

Our customer base in particular reflects our established position and depth of integration into their respective
value chains, with the top ten customers by revenue across all markets accounting for approximately 60%, based
on internal assessments, of our group-wide revenue in the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Our
established customer base in our CDMO Crop Science business includes the top five Crop Science majors across
all major crop systems in our key end-markets, with whom we work in close cooperation in terms of process
development and planning as well as the lifecycle of the project (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).
In addition, while agrochemicals are a key end-market for our products, we are diversifying into other applications
such as further high-value intermediates within Advanced Intermediates, pharmaceuticals and Specialties. For our
Exclusives products in particular, the close customer cooperation enables de-risked investments in growth capex
for further capacity and technology expansion through customer contributions (e.g., capex co-investment or ‘takeor-pay’ commitments by customers).

Over the last three years, we have established a track record of consistent project wins (at least one major 1[st]
campaign project per year), building upon our deep integration into our customers’ value chains and our reputation
of reliability and ability to manage complex processes. As of March 31, 2023, we also had multiple projects in
varying ramp-up phases, supporting growth of the business. The growth capex associated with these ramp-up
projects mainly targets or has targeted capacity expansion for Exclusives and Specialties across our plants, and
production under these projects is expected to ramp-up over the short-term.

**_Attractive CDMO business model: high visibility, de-risked growth and recurring earnings_**

For our Exclusives products, we have developed strategic partnerships with well-known companies, including
some of the largest global agrochemicals producers, including blue chip customers in our key end-markets. Due
to our high level of integration into our customers’ product development and long contract terms for most of our
contracts, we have high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Our long-term contracts often
provide for guaranteed volumes in the initial period, contributing to a high contract renewal rate and low customer
churn for a large part of our portfolio. Because of our strong market position and customer integration, we also
have high visibility into our customers’ future demand and their upcoming product launches. For example, we
received customer inquiries from five top Crop Science players for 70% of all active ingredients launched or
planned to be launched in the market between 2020 and 2023E (calculated as share of novel active ingredients
and advanced/key intermediate launches where we were inquired) and have won projects in novel active
ingredients with these players at a success rate of approximately 40% (calculated as the share of projects won if
we were inquired).

Moreover, our customers in the CDMO business typically contractually agree for new products to either (i)
contribute a portion of the capital expenditures related to new product developments and the production line setup,
with minimum contract terms providing payback of the capital expenditures incurred directly by us, or (ii) firm
take-or-pay agreements with limited capital expenditures contributions upfront. We continue to invest
significantly in growth projects to deliver contracted new product wins and in maintenance to safeguard asset
reliability. Our disciplined selection criteria in our CDMO business are focused on superior contracts with limited
investment periods for growth capex projects where we typically target EBITDA pay-back periods of
approximately three years and return rates of approximately 25% IRR secured by binding customer capex or
offtake commitments. While this is not achieved in all our projects, we aim to strengthen our product portfolio
over time with projects that either match our key criteria or otherwise offer strategic opportunities.

We are well positioned to benefit from the ramp-up of contracted growth projects in Kokkola and Pratteln with
an existing agreement portfolio featuring ‘take-or-pay’ commitments. For more information, see also “⸺Our
_Product Portfolio.”_

**_Resilient Top-line Growth and Strong Margins with Significant Future Upside_**

We have shown our ability to maintain high revenue growth and margin stability, especially within Exclusives
and Specialties, driven by new product wins and strong demand in the existing portfolio, while maintaining
flexibility to changing market conditions through our ability to partially pass on increasing raw material and
energy costs. Most recently, we commissioned a new line of product under a ‘take-or-pay’ contract and secured a
new contract in our Exclusives business. Our major project wins over the last four years reflect our consistent
track-record of winning and delivering large-scale projects:

In addition, our rationalization of our portfolio to focus on high margin and growth products (e.g., DCA, GA for
skin care applications) as well as price increases in Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals have further
contributed to our successful performance. We have also been able to adjust our business to the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic without major impacts on our operations or financial results due to resilient demand from
Crop Science and Life Science customers. Driven by our management’s commitment to support high-value
products and projects, we have been able to consistently generate stable margins.

As a result, our revenue increased at a CAGR of 23.9% from €492.3 million for the financial year ended December
31, 2020 to €755.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue growth in 2022 was primarily
driven by strong demand in both our product groups across the portfolio supported by higher pricing effects, in
particular partial pass-through of increased raw material prices and supply chain costs in our Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group.

Our Adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 20.0% from €112.9 million for the financial year ended
December 31, 2020 to €162.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The significant growth in
Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 in particular was due to an increase in pricing resulting in a higher margin for our
products from customers in our Exclusives and Specialties business as well as positive pricing effects in our
Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals business.

**_Backward-integrated model that enables re-use of by-products and reduction of waste_**

Increasing operational efficiency is a top priority for us as it provides clear benefits. When these benefits are
combined, they create a virtuous cycle by minimizing negative environmental impacts, creating cost advantages
in production, driving innovation and enabling our long-term competitiveness.

Production processes always result in byproducts. We aim to reuse or commercialize such byproducts wherever
feasible and avoid waste wherever possible. To this end, we believe we operate a highly efficient circular economy
processes and we eliminate waste by developing highly efficient processes with optimized product yields and
reusing materials within production cycles. Besides the environmental and sustainability advantages, this type of
closed-loop system also has tangible financial benefits, as it can reduce costs for raw materials and waste
treatments. In Pratteln, we are contributing to the creation of a circular economy using a “Verbund System”. This
enables highly efficient and sustainable chlorination and sulfonation reactions. Chlorine and sulfur trioxide are
produced as primary raw materials and used to manufacture a variety of chlorination and sulfonation reagents. In
turn, these are used to produce further downstream intermediates and active ingredients. The HCl and SO2
generated as off-gases are separated, purified and recycled, reused or resold.

Finally, our production sites benefit from high supply chain resilience through backward integration of key raw
materials and production processes for our Exclusives and Specialties Products (by using our Advanced
Intermediates production). In particular, our main multi-purpose plant in Pratteln uses an innovative set-up that
offers high efficiency production of Exclusives and Specialties products, based on backwards integration of the
key raw materials of chlorine. Together with the supply of large volumes of necessary MCA from our sites in
Germany, we can therefore contribute to supply resilience, as we are in control of the relevant production steps
and at the same time can manage the direct commercialization of side streams generated in the production
processes, which are then sold as Base Chemicals. See “⸺Production Facilities.” We benefit from close
proximity to our customers’ main production sites in the Western markets and we focus on developing and
maintaining strong logistic capabilities to enable seamless fulfillment and integration in the respective customer’s
supply chain. The chart below shows our production site locations around the world and our production
capabilities:

**_Focus on ESG and sustainability principles_**

We have made ESG one of our corporate priorities and consider it a key element of our success. Due to the nature
of our business and our position as a business partner deeply integrated into our customers’ supply chains, we are
aware of the importance of ESG in daily operations as our performance directly translates into the value chain and
ESG commitments of our partners.

We have underlined our sustainability commitment by committing to seven UN sustainable development goals,
signing the ‘UN Global Compact’, ‘Charta der Vielfalt’ and the ‘Responsible Care’ initiative. Our corporate
programs are based on external standards and assessments, and we have set up a special team as well as an ESG
management tool for implementing and monitoring our ESG measures. In 2022, we became a member of the
“Together for Sustainability” initiative, a collaboration of operating chemical companies that are committed to
sustainability throughout their value chains. From 2022 on, all our sites will undergo annual audits by Eco-Vadis
with the latest ratings conducted in 2022. Furthermore, our holistic approach to ESG is reflected by, among other
indicators, our twelve sustainability targets, which comprise seven targets by 2025 and five by 2030, respectively,
and by the role of ESG performance in management bonus schemes.

In addition, we are focused on our social responsibility and, as a result, strive to offer employees an attractive and
inspiring work environment that provides opportunities for individual development and growth. We focus on
promoting diversity as well as occupational health and safety as essential components for operational excellence.
See “Our Business⸺ESG and Sustainability.”

**_Focused, Credible Management Team with Proven Track Record_**

We have a highly qualified workforce alongside an experienced management team with deep industry experience.
Our management team has successfully repositioned CABB as an integrated CDMO platform and led a significant
step-up in growth and margin since 2018, effectively managing our continued success during the COVID-19
pandemic.

Our demonstrated track record has been achieved by strict contract discipline and a streamlined organizational
setup, while simultaneously leveraging efficiencies from OneCABB (which combined our legacy business units
into one integrated company to flatten the organizational structure and drive efficiencies across functions) and
making further improvements to operational excellence. This has been the basis of the successful transformation
of our business, developing a differentiated CDMO position with highly successful year-over-year improvements
over the past five years, including developing on our environmental, social and governance practices.

We believe our management’s industry knowledge and leadership, combined with their long-term experience,
provide us with the skills necessary to continue improving performance and efficiency through a common
corporate infrastructure and the implementation of best practices across our network, which constitutes a
significant competitive advantage and drives our future.

On March 24, 2023, we announced that Thomas H. Ahrens will become the new chief executive officer of CABB
Group following Valerie Diele-Braun’s departure. Mr. Ahrens will join CABB on June 1, 2023 and succeed

107


-----

Valerie Diele-Braun after a transition period of a few months. We believe Mr. Ahrens to be an experienced leader
who has a positive track record in driving sustainable growth and profitability. Building on his extensive industry
expertise, we believe he will strengthen the Group’s position as a premier contract development and
manufacturing organization and leading producer of proprietary ingredients for customers in the Life Science and
Performance Materials industries.

**Our Strategy**

The following is a summary of the activities we are currently undertaking in pursuit of these opportunities:

**_Deliver excellence in production to optimize profitability_**

We are focused on further developing our project portfolio and aim to add more high-value projects to our
portfolio each year, keeping in line with our historical project win rates. Our established market position in
Exclusives serves as the backbone of our strategy by continuously driving resilient growth and margin stability,
complemented by high growth in existing niche markets in Specialties and further supported by fundamental
market trends. We are dedicated to continue focusing on novel active ingredients and high-value products,
expanding our distribution and geographical reach in our Life Science applications and focusing on high-purity
and higher margin segments in Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals for attractive contracts with
increasing capacity. We aim to further increase our operational excellence by focusing on efficiency,
strengthening key account and sales functions, ramp-ups of additional capacities and continuous de-bottlenecking,
as well as fostering our commercial excellence by winning new customers from large, less reliable competitors in
the MCA business.

**_Deliver de-risked capacity and technology expansion_**

We will continue to strengthen our strategic positioning in Exclusives and Specialties by focusing on novel active
ingredients and investments in state-of-the-art technologies. We believe that we can benefit from a ramp-up in a
number of contracted and already invested projects across Exclusives and Specialties products with contractual
‘take-or-pay’ or exclusivity clauses which are underpinned by a well invested asset base that, as a result,
significantly reduces the risks associated with their execution. We expect to additionally benefit from leveraging
partial cost pass-through mechanisms in future contracts. Consequently, we believe our business is highly resilient
and that the predictable customer demand for our CDMO and other highly specialized products offers high
visibility on the underlying product lifecycle and returns for a certain part of the portfolio.

**_Strong focus on client relationships and varied commercial capabilities_**

We are dedicated to winning new projects by leveraging our long-standing relationships with our blue chip
customer base as well as our know-how and reputation as a trusted Western CDMO Crop Science business partner
to accelerate and win new contracts as proven in the past. In addition, we plan to further increase our Specialties
revenue through a push of our attractive portfolio to additional geographies and customers expanding the volume
of our high margin products.

Furthermore, as some of our main customer relationships exceed 15 years, we have established ourselves as a key
outsourcing partner with trusted supplier status for our clients worldwide who often return to extend existing
projects or to collaborate with us on potential new products. As a result, we have very low customer churn,
particularly for our Exclusives and Specialties offering, and our top customers work with us for a multitude of
individual products. We will continue to strengthen those long-standing customer relationships by working closely
with our customers to meet their volume and specification needs for their existing and new products. We intend
to expand our production capacity to meet the growing demand of our key customers, continue to optimize our
production processes to share efficiency gains and work closely with them to tailor our production processes to
new products.

We intend to continue to focus on multinational customers and industry leaders, in an effort to benefit from strong
innovation and global market penetration opportunities. By further strengthening our relationships with
multinational customers who have leading market positions in their industries, we seek to grow with them as they
expand their businesses. The introduction of OneCABB has allowed us to further streamline our customers
primary points of contact with us and will, we believe, contribute to even stronger customer relationships.

108


-----

**_Develop and further expand into additional markets_**

We remain focused on targeted capacity expansion to capture growing demand and additional production volumes
that our customers seek to outsource to us, in line with new growth projects of our customers. Jayhawk, located
in the United States, produces customized agricultural, pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals and continues to
offer the potential for standalone growth from its existing pipeline portfolio and production of new products, as
well as proximity to customers in the Americas. In addition, we believe our Pratteln and Kokkola sites have
benefited from cooperation with Jayhawk due to the fact that we can offer various technologies and additional
geographies and act in an agile manner according to their needs.

By focusing on high quality services, we plan to further capture rising needs in markets which deliver higher
margin profiles, for example, pharma, personal care, nutrition and performance materials. This will allow us to
capitalize our operating leverage and efficiency gains by, for example, planning to hold plant costs relatively
stable despite topline growth. We continue to focus on high capacity utilization as the key success factor for
sustainable development, as well as optimized logistics solutions such as the addition of our leased titanium fleet
of railcars which will allow for the delivery of more product with fewer railcars due to its lower weight and better
loading factor.

**_Maintain focus on profitability and cash flow_**

We will continue to focus on improving our profitability through cost savings and efficiency enhancements where
possible, such as investments in energy saving measures, footprint optimization and automatization. We believe
that there is an ongoing potential for efficiency measures through continuous optimization of our manufacturing
processes and recycling streams. We intend to seek to further improve cash flow generation by maximizing the
utilization of our production facilities and expanding our production capacity (e.g., in Kokkola and Jayhawk), as
well as continuing investments for maintenance to preserve our well-maintained asset base. At the same time, we
plan to remain disciplined in our growth capital expenditure projects by securing customers’ longer-term volume
commitments in advance and co-investments in the form of upfront capital expenditure or top-up pricing over the
terms of customers’ contracts.

**_Maintain health, safety and environmental excellence_**

We are committed to a strategy of ESG and sustainability based on environmentally responsible manufacturing
processes and ensuring the health and safety of our employees. We aim to benefit from the strong collaboration
on ESG and sustainability with customers and industry platforms to improve our sustainability footprint while
capitalizing on operating efficiencies. The strong collaboration on ESG in negotiations is based on joint
improvement programs further developing our green footprint in our customers’ value chain which, in turn, also
contributes to operational efficiencies. Our production facilities in Pratteln and Gersthofen play a significant role
in our effort to conserve energy and resources and to reduce emissions and waste. We believe measuring ourselves
at a high standard with respect to ESG and sustainability contributes not only to environmental and societal goals
but also makes us an even more attractive partner to our business partners in their selection of partners within their
value chain. See “Our Business⸺ESG and Sustainability.”

**Our History**

109


-----

Our business has its origins in the chemical production activities of Hoechst AG, which originally commissioned
our production facility in Gersthofen, Germany, in 1905 as well as our production facility in Knapsack, Germany,
in 1949. In 1997, the Hoechst Specialty Chemicals business was acquired by Clariant. Several years later, in 2003,
the CABB Group GmbH was founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clariant before being acquired by an
Investment Management in 2005 and then by AXA Private Equity in the following year.

In 2007, we acquired SF Chem, including our production facility in Pratteln, Switzerland, which allowed us to
expand into contract manufacturing. In 2011, we were acquired by Bridgepoint; that same year we acquired
KemFine from 3i and commenced production at our facility in Kokkola, Finland, to further expand our contract
manufacturing capabilities.

In 2013, we expanded our footprint to Asia through the establishment of a joint venture with Jining Jinwei Gold
Power to acquire Jinwei Huasheng Chemicals. We hold a 67% stake in the joint venture entity CABB-Jinwei
Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co., Ltd.

In 2014, we were acquired by the Permira Funds and have since invested in an electrolysis plant in Pratteln,
capacity expansions and de-bottlenecking in most facilities as well as in a new wastewater facility in China.

In 2019, we acquired Evonik Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation, one of the leading fine chemicals companies
in the U.S., from Evonik Industries AG.

In 2021, we introduced OneCABB, which combined our legacy business units into one integrated company to
flatten the organizational structure and drive efficiencies across functions.

**Our Products**

Our production portfolio comprises two product groups: (i) Exclusives and Specialties and (ii) Advanced
Intermediates and Base Chemicals. Across these product groups, our offering is primarily focused on novel active
ingredients.

The following table shows our revenue by product group for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022:

**Revenue**
**2020** **2021** **2022**
**in € million**

**(audited)**
Exclusives and Specialties ............................................................. 312.2 367.3 429.3
Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals ................................ 180.1 221.7 326.2
**Total ..............................................................................................** **492.3** **589.0** **755.5**

**_Exclusives and Specialties_**

Exclusives and Specialties consist of high-value products we offer to our Crop Science and Life Science clients
that fully leverage our experience and technical capabilities. Exclusive products include tailor-made solutions for
proprietary and innovative active ingredients as well as specialty ingredients and derivatives. Exclusives and
Specialties products accounted for €429.3 million or 56.8% of our revenue for the financial year ended December
31, 2022 (2021: €367.3 million or 62.4%; 2020: €312.2 million or 63.4%).

_Exclusives_

Exclusives, our CDMO portfolio, consists of mainly products used as active ingredients or intermediates in the
Crop Science industry. Underpinning our clear focus on the Crop Science market segment, we manufacture
customized active ingredients on an exclusive and confidential basis for our customers and specialize in complex
multi-stage processing and quality assurance. Our active ingredients are produced to match our individual
customers’ specifications with regard to both their production systems and end product requirements (one
customer, one product). These products are usually based on customer-developed IP and thus are tailored, highly
complex and technically challenging active ingredients.

The active ingredients as well as complex building blocks we produce are used by our customers primarily for
herbicides for corn, cotton and sugarcane and insecticides and fungicides for a broad range of applications. We
currently manufacture approximately 30 different exclusives for use in agricultural and Crop Science applications,
representing a significant driver for our sales and profitability growth. In addition to the Crop Science market, our

110


-----

exclusive custom synthesis products are manufactured for applications in certain specialty end-markets (e.g.,
animal health).

To create these exclusive products, we develop long-term projects and contracts with most of our customers for a
large part of our portfolio, characterized initially by capital expenditure commitments or ‘take-or-pay’ clauses to
design the custom production facilities required as well as long-term purchase commitments from the customers,
providing attractive return profiles. See also “—Our product portfolio.”

We contractually obtain customer lock-in from their co-investment in capex or ‘take-or-pay’ clauses, and our
customers benefit from our differentiating process know-how. Our multi-year contracts give us high visibility on
the underlying product lifecycle and returns for a large part of our portfolio. We serve as the sole supplier for
many of our exclusives customers, and our contracts with these customers emphasize volume commitments and/or
‘take-or pay’ clauses particularly at their start. Within our multi-purpose plants we maintain a well-balanced
offering across crops and active ingredient types and remain relatively insulated from seasonal fluctuations in
demand for any particular crop. We are not materially involved in the production of raw materials or finished
product for glyphosate or neonicotinoids.

We operate three production facilities capable of producing tailor made products in Exclusives: one in Pratteln,
Switzerland, one in Kokkola, Finland and one in Galena, Kansas, United States. See “—Production Facilities.”

_Specialties_

Our Specialty portfolio comprises ingredients for Life Science (in particular DCA, GA and CAE) and Performance
Materials (in particular BTDA) and targets market segments with expected high customer value-add and growth
potential. These include a variety of end-market applications in Life Science including starting materials for
innovative pharmaceuticals, actives for cosmetics, building blocks for nutrition supplements and food and
beverage ingredients as well as applications in Performance Materials (e.g., for mobile electronic devices and
semiconductors). Our products are based on our differentiating technology platforms and our deep understanding
of customer application requirements contributing to a strong customer lock-in.

We are a leading supplier in the Western world for highly profitable Specialties. Our leading quality levels of our
products also provide for further expansion opportunities in Asia. We obtain customer lock-in as a result of our
differentiating portfolio for niche applications.

For innovative pharmaceuticals, ultra-pure Dichloroacetic Acid (DCA) and Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) (both of
which we produce) are used as a critical starting material for the production of oligonucleotides which are used
for novel RNAi based pharmaceuticals, e.g., antisense RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA). We are the global
market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNA-based
medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022) (Roland
Berger Report, Company Information).

For cosmetic applications, Glycolic acid (GA) is one of our other primary ingredients with a differentiating purity
profile. Due to its capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid has many applications as an active ingredient in skin
care and personal care with main applications in anti-aging products such as face masks and peels. In cosmetic
grade GA, we are globally the second largest supplier (measured by revenue as of 2022) and the only European
producer with global coverage (Company assessment based on the Roland Berger Report).

For nutrition supplements and food & beverage ingredients, our portfolio comprises building blocks for the
production of vitamins, e.g., vitamin B6, as well as acetates which are used as a buffering agent in various
industrial applications and as a preservative or flavor enhancer in the food industry. We maintain a leading market
position in the production of CAE (the building blocks for vitamins) due to our strong relationships with key
customers (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

In Performance Materials, we supply dianhydrides in a variety of end-markets, including in the semiconductor
production and mobile devices including 5G and smart devices, as well as high performance materials for
engineering applications, such as those used in fibers for hot gas filtration and for acoustic and thermal insulations.
With regards to one of the Performance Materials applications products we produce, BTDA, we are the only large
scale ultrapure producer with production footprint in the United States (Roland Berger Report, Company
Information).

We operate three production facilities capable of producing Specialties: one in Pratteln, Switzerland, one in
Gersthofen, Germany and one in Galena, Kansas, United States. See “—Production Facilities.”

111


-----

**_Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals_**

Intermediates are chemical products that require significant expertise and technical equipment to manufacture,
which are not produced for one specific customer but have multiple applications across many end-markets and
are suitable to many use cases. Intermediates are used in crop protection as well as in pharmaceutical, Life Science
and specialized applications such as automotive and detergents. Our Advanced Intermediates offering is
predominantly focused on personal care and nutrition within Life Science.

Our portfolio comprises mainly monochloroacetic acids (MCA), acid chlorides and chlorine-based products as
well as selected base chemicals as by-products generated from our chlor-alkali electrolysis and chlorination
processes. Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals are produced in highly efficient large-scale production
assets in our facilities in Gersthofen and Knapsack, Germany, and in Pratteln, Switzerland as well as in China
through our joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd. (formerly Jining Jinwei Gold Power Co., Ltd.).
In Knapsack we produce Advanced Intermediates based on a close relationship with a chlorine supplier within
the same industrial park.

Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals accounted for €326.2 million or 43.2% of our revenue for the
financial year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: €221.7 million or 37.6%; 2020: €180.1 million or 36.6%).

_Advanced Intermediates_

Our Advanced Intermediates portfolio comprises MCA, acid chlorides and chlorine-based products as key product
groups.

MCA is a key building block for the organic synthesis of ingredients in crop protection applications, Life Sciences,
pharmaceuticals as well as in chemical products. We offer customers the full MCA portfolio spanning across all
relevant MCA grades up to ultra-pure qualities as well as all relevant formulations such as solutions, melt and
MCA salts (SMCA). Our production facilities benefit from state-of-the-art hydrogenation technology. We are one
of the largest European Life Science MCA suppliers (measured by production volume in Europe as of 2022). A
significant share of our MCA product is produced for captive demand from certain MCA derivatives in the Life
Science business. MCA is further used for (captive) Crop Science demand in Exclusives and Specialties business
(Roland Berger, Company Information).

Our acid chlorides and chlorine-based products portfolio includes products such as chloroacetyl chloride (CAC1)
which is used in crop protection applications as well as in pharmaceutical applications (e.g., pain relievers) and
various additional acid chlorides and chlorides products which are used in agrochemical synthesis and are also
applied in the synthesis of organic peroxides, car tires, sizing agents, flavor and fragrance, high blood pressure
medications, antibiotics and animal feed stock additives.

_Base Chemicals_

Our chlor-alkali electrolysis processes (used to create key precursors for our Exclusives and Specialties products
as well as the advanced intermediates) yields two main co-products: chlorine and caustic soda. In various
chlorination processes, chlorine is partially utilized in the process and with the remainder being transformed into
hydrogen chloride and hydrochloric acid as solution. We increase our efficiency by selling the caustic soda,
hydrochloric acid and other co-products we cannot recycle back into our production processes to third-party
customers.

Sales of caustic soda are typically made to customers and other third parties through distributors, with the majority
of purchasers located within 300 kilometers of our Gersthofen and Pratteln sites due to transportation costs. The
market is partially protected as logistics costs limit longer distance shipping. In Switzerland, where we are the
only producer of caustic soda, we sell a substantial part of our base products via pipeline to tenants of the
Schweizerhalle industrial cluster based on long-term contracts, offering superior supply reliability.

**Product Applications**

Our product portfolio has a number of applications across our major end-markets, Crop Science, Life Science and
Performance Materials and the growth of these underlying addressable markets is a contributing factor to our
results.

112


-----

**_Uses for our products in Crop Science_**

In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the
Crop Science market (measured as a percentage of revenues).

Chemicals we produce are used by our clients to develop herbicides protecting multiple crops including maize,
soybean, sunflower, sugarcane and fruits and vegetables. As a result we maintain an offering across crops and we
have benefited in parts of our portfolio from the decrease in some existing generics under regulatory and public
scrutiny by producing replacement products. We are not materially involved in the production of raw materials or
finished product for glyphosate or neonicotinoids.

**_Uses for our products in Life Science_**

In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 20% of our products were used in the Life
Science market (measured as a percentage of revenues). We believe that the addressable markets for our products
within Life Science will grow until 2027 due to featured noteworthy developments in specific segments with high
demand, such as: novel RNA therapeutics, vitamins and supplements as well as rising adoption in skin care
products as detailed below.

_RNA-based Pharma Applications_

We are a leading Dichloroacetic acid (or DCA) producer used for RNA and oligonucleotide applications, with
DCA being an essential input for the production of RNA from DNA. DCA helps to synthesize nucleic acids that
are then used in numerous therapeutic active pharmaceutical ingredients in various phases of clinical trials and
few products already in commercial stage (Roland Berger, Company Information).

The DCA market is highly differentiated by its level of purity and through our state-of-the-art facilities, we are
able to produce the highest purity levels and managed to fulfill the emergent demand for DCA in 2020, 2021 and
2022. Main RNA-based market growth drivers are investments in research and development to improve genomic
technologies as well as the broadening the field of application (e.g. “oligonucleotide therapeutics”). As a result of
further uses of DCA in the chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides and broader commercial application of the
therapeutics, the addressable market is forecasted to grow by a wide range between 2022 and 2027 (Roland Berger,
Company Information). For more information on projected growth and key market drivers, see “Industry and
_Market Data⸺Life Science⸺General⸺DCA” and “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺General⸺DCA_
_Key Drivers.”_

_Building blocks for vitamins_

Our product CAE is used as the basis for Vitamin B6 synthesis used, for example, for nutrition. The vitamins
market is estimated to grow between 2022 and 2027 (3% to 4% market value CAGR). Key drivers that support
this growth include: (i) an increased focus on preventative health care; (ii) a rise of personalized and functional
nutrition; and (iii) the use of vitamins in animal food (Roland Berger).

_Skin care_

We are a key supplier of high purity Glycolic Acid for fast-growing skin care applications, e.g., anti-aging and
deep facial cleansers, with the market for skincare products expected to grow between 2022 and 2027 (market
value CAGR of 3% to 4% from 2022 to 2025 and 4% to 6% from 2025 to 2027). Key drivers that support this
growth include: (i) a rising focus on personal appearance and related beauty products, particularly in the emerging
markets; (ii) new care product developments of personal care players; and (iii) a continued usage of Glycolic Acid
in personal care products (e.g. anti-age products) in combination with an aging population (Roland Berger).

_Personal care, packaged food & pharma_

We are one of the largest European Life Science MCA suppliers (by production volume in Europe as of 2022).
The personal care market is expected to grow between 2022 and 2027 (4% to 5% market CAGR by volume in k
tons). Key drivers that support this growth include: (i) a higher demand for hygiene products due to increasing
awareness for hygiene and cleanliness as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) changing consumer preferences
from solid to liquid products; and (iii) the continued usage of CMC as a thickening agent or stabilizer in food and
beverages (Roland Berger).

**_Uses for our products in Performance Materials_**

In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 15% of our products were used in the
Performance Materials market (measured as a percentage of revenues). Performance materials are used in the
creation of curatives in epoxies, polyimides, polyesters and other resin systems. These products have multiple
applications such as the coating and protection of electronic components as well as in producing composites and
adhesives, with common uses in electronic components, semiconductors, electric motor components and industrial
coating. Furthermore, Performance Materials created with our products include composites, fibers, films, and
foams that provide heat and electrical resistance and stability under aggressive conditions. End-uses of such
Performance Materials include, among others: flexible printed circuitry and foldable displays for smart devices,
composite components for automotive and aviation, thermal insulation for aircraft and marine vessels, coatings
and tubing for medical devices and radiation shielding for spacecraft.

Our products cater to the niche applications in mobile electronics, transportation and green energy. Specifically,
we supply (i) certain dianhydrides (BTDA and 6FDA) and (ii) one product which eventually goes into the
semiconductor end-market.

Moreover, BTDA is used for numerous applications in electronics, infrastructure and transportation with limited
competition. With regards to BTDA, we are the only large scale ultrapure producer with production footprint in
the United States (Roland Berger). For more information on growth rates and key drivers, see “Industry and
_Market Data⸺Performance Materials⸺Specialty Anhydrides⸺General” and “Industry and Market_
_Data⸺Performance Materials⸺Electronic Performance Materials Product⸺General.”_

**_Uses for our products in Base Chemicals_**

In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 15% of our products were used in Base
Chemicals (measured as a percentage of revenues, includes MCA used across industries for further refinement).
Base Chemicals are produced as by-products generated from our chlor-alkali electrolysis and chlorination
processes and primarily consist of two main products: chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda). Caustic soda
is used in the production of various other intermediate products, for example, in chemicals to manufacture organic
chemicals as a dehydrochlorinating agent, catalyst or neutralization agent (Roland Berger). We believe that caustic
soda demand is structurally outgrowing production capacities in Europe due to various technology shifts. Enduses of such Base Chemicals include, among others, the pulp and paper and alumina industry. For more
information on growth rates and key drivers, see “Industry and Market Data⸺Sodium Hydroxide.”

**Our Product Portfolio**

Our Exclusives and Specialties business model is built around a strong product portfolio of customer orders and
long-term projects for a large part of our portfolio, supporting high visibility of the underlying product lifecycle
and returns. We generate a significant amount of our Group’s profitability from our CDMO activities in the
Exclusives product group through long-term projects for our customers. To a smaller extent, our Specialties
contracts are also a strong contributor to profitability.

In Exclusives, we also benefit from de-risked growth capex investments as customers contribute to the capex
required to set up productions (e.g., co-investment undertakings by customer or ‘take-or-pay’ commitments). This
also adds to such customers’ switching costs and helps create long lasting relations due to our integration in their
supply chain and generally results in very low customer churn and high contract renewal rates for our Exclusives
products.

**_Project selection and Tender process_**

We try to closely manage our project tenders and open offers, prioritizing large-scale growth projects for our
Exclusives products and advantageous Specialties contracts. As a result, we regularly review our open tenders as
well as ongoing projects against key investment metrics, checking if our production capacity is used effectively.

Between 2020 and 2022, we received approximately 200 project inquiries across all our business operations
(Exclusives, Specialties and Advanced Intermediates). After evaluating the individual characteristics of each
potential project, 13 potential projects were further developed in the same period through to the offer stage, where
we tender an offer for a given customer product. In the selection process, we benefit from a proven reliability
record and trusted supplier status in the market, underpinned by our strong technology and execution capabilities
as well as standout client services. We believe these act as distinguishing factors in the tender process, particularly
when compared to competitors in Western and Asian markets.

114


-----

Over the last three years, we have established a track record of consistent project wins (at least one major 1[st]
campaign project per year), building upon our deep integration into our customers’ value chains and our reputation
of reliability and ability to manage complex processes. In the same period, we generally signed an additional one
to two other Exclusive or Specialties products contracts to further strengthen utilization and returns of our installed
asset base with limited investment requirements.

**_Key targets for investment criteria and capex requirements applicable to our CDMO Exclusives projects_**

Tailor-made products based on customer-developed IP require custom-built production lines and close
cooperation with our customers to achieve the requested quality, volume and product specification. This requires
significant ramp-up times and costs to set-up appropriate production lines and processes. We contractually commit
to such long-term projects (under contractual frameworks) for a large part of our portfolio with the expectation
that we will recover our initial investments in the short-term and achieve attractive returns and profitability growth
in the mid- to long-term. If we successfully find projects that match our targeted key investment criteria, we stand
to benefit from increased profitability and visibility on the underlying product lifecycle and returns.

We aim to find projects that allow an EBITDA pay-back of our capex investment in approximately three years
from the start of production. To achieve this, we seek a minimum contractual length for CDMO projects in
Exclusives, as well as include other mechanisms (e.g., co-investments by customers) to ensure the recovery of our
capex. Our customers cover part of our incurred capex either through initial co-investments or through ‘take-orpay’ clauses committing our customers’ to minimum purchase volumes and prices. This co-investment helps
integrate our services into our customers’ value chains and adds to their potential cost to switch suppliers, which
generally drives very-high project renewal rates. Our typical CDMO contract models follow one of two contract
templates: we either engage in CDMO contracts featuring a facility fee, where customers take on a share of the
initial capex investment and our project margins are in line with market levels or, as an alternative, we provide
CDMO contracts featuring an offtake arrangement, where the initial capex investment is largely funded by us and
our desired return profile is achieved through ‘take-or pay’ contract provisions. As a result, the customer has a
limited capex commitment upfront but through a firm offtake arrangement, the customer commits to purchase a
certain amount of our future output for an extended period (typically five years). These CDMO contracts usually
feature higher product margins to compensate for our larger upfront capex commitment and are oftentimes
renewed before the end of their initial term.

Furthermore, before committing our capacity to a given long-term project, we try to assess the projected internal
rate of return (IRR) of each new project over the span of its predicted lifecycle, and aim to select advantageous
returns (IRR targets of 25%). While this is not achieved in all our projects, we aim to strengthen our product
portfolio over time with projects that either match our key criteria or otherwise offer strategic opportunities.

**_Product Portfolio Visibility_**

Due to contractual commitments and yearly purchase schedules, we have a strong visibility over the underlying
product lifecycle and returns of a large part of our Exclusives products.

As of March 31, 2023, we also had 14 projects in varying ramp-up phases, which are expected to contribute to
our revenue and profitability growth in the short to medium term.

**Our Customer Relationships**

We are a trusted supplier to a broad base of many established companies, including leading Crop Science, Life
Sciences and specialty chemical companies who rely on our solutions for their own products and applications. We
have developed long-standing relationships with our key customers, which in many cases span several decades.
Our customer relationships benefit from our close integration into our customers’ supply chain and co-investments
from key customers into production facilities through their longer-term commitments for certain products. We
also benefit from rising outsourcing trends, particularly for our Crop Science customers, as they shift their
businesses to asset-light, R&D-centric models.

We are regarded as a strategic supplier to some of our top customers, which involves close cooperation with the
customer in terms of process development and demand planning. We believe that we are a “key supplier” for
several of our customers, which makes us an important partner to the customer and help us to maintain our stable
customer base. Moreover, we believe that such supply contracts are less volatile than top-up contracts and
substantial capex investment, tiered pricing and constant yield improvement result in higher switching costs for
customers to later source products from other suppliers. This has resulted in very low customer churn rates. In
2021 and 2022, we had an overall average customer retention rate of approximately 98% (based on existing

115


-----

customer revenue over total revenue for the respective year) which illustrates, together with the high rate of
contract renewal and lock-in effects, the “stickiness” of our topline in Exclusives.

Within the Advanced Intermediates portfolio of the Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group,
our products have the following estimated amount of customers as of 2022: (i) for MCA we serve over 50
customers; (ii) for SMCA we serve approximately 50 customers; and (iii) for Chloroacetyl Chloride (CAC1) we
serve approximately 15 customers. In Specialties, our customer base includes more than 60 accounts and in
hydrochloric acid (Base Chemicals) more than 30.

Our average duration of business relationships with our top four customers in Crop Science exceeds 15 years in
tenure (based on management estimates between 2020 and 2022) and a number of our Crop Science blue-chip
relationships span more than 30 years.

**Production Facilities**

We operate six production facilities across Germany, Switzerland, the United States, Finland and China. These
are located in Pratteln (Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland), Galena (Kansas, United States), Gersthofen (Germany)
and Knapsack (Germany) and Jining, Shandong Province (China). The following table sets out certain information
related to our production facilities as of December 31, 2022:

**Production Facilities** **Ownership**

Gersthofen, Germany ..................................................................................... Leased
Knapsack, Germany ....................................................................................... Leased
Jining Shandong, China ................................................................................. Leased/Land usage rights

Kokkola, Finland ............................................................................................ Owned
Galena, Kansas, United States ........................................................................ Owned

(1) Represents production volume divided by actual capacity (nameplate capacity adjusted for planned turnarounds).

In addition to our production facilities above, we maintain sales offices in Charlotte, North Carolina (USA) and
Shanghai (China). Our production facilities are described below in greater detail.

**_Pratteln_**

We acquired our Pratteln site through the acquisition of SF-Chem in 2007. It is located close to Basel, Switzerland
on approximately 168,829 square meters. The Pratteln site is a custom synthesis production facility with a focus
on our Exclusives portfolio offering several multi-purpose production lines and dedicated single purpose
production plants including scale-up capabilities. However, the multi-purpose nature of the plant means that we
regularly service all product groups and all end-markets from this location. Our production facilities at Pratteln
offer backward integration of our Exclusives portfolio into a number of the raw materials including a chlor-alkali
plant and rail and highway transport connections for customer supply chain integration. Most of the chlorine
required for chlorination is produced on site, while MCA is sourced from our Knapsack and Gersthofen facilities
and transported by rail to our Pratteln production facilities, where it is an important raw material for one of the
key active ingredients in agrochemicals Exclusives.

Pratteln’s integrated production system enables recovery of by-products and exhaust to improve efficiency and
our sustainability proposition by minimizing energy needs and waste.

**_Kokkola_**

We acquired our Kokkola site through the acquisition of KemFine in August 2011. The site is located in a large
chemical industrial complex in the industrial area of Kokkola on approximately 142,000 square meters. The
Kokkola site is a custom synthesis production facility mainly for our agrochemicals in our Exclusives portfolio
offering several highly automated multi-purpose production lines. The production lines comprise a total batch
reactor volume of approximately 550 cubic meters supported by a strong site infrastructure and including in-house
incineration capabilities.

Combining large-scale production capacities and infrastructure, a high degree of automatization and an
operational track record, our Kokkola site offers improved economics for our existing products as well as for our

116


-----

new growth projects. Furthermore, our Kokkola site derives its energy supply entirely from wind and hydropower.
In January 2023, we committed to an investment of €50 million by 2025, including the contribution of a new
office building as well as measures to reduce CO2 emissions, e.g., a modification of our waste incineration plant,
which underlines our commitment to sustainability.

**_Galena_**

The Jayhawk facility is located in Galena, Kansas on approximately 3.3 million square meters, of which 202,000
square meters are used. Jayhawk has state-of-the-art facilities for Exclusives and Specialties products with high
growth potential based on its existing portfolio and the ramping up of new products. The Jayhawk site offers
several custom synthesis production lines mainly for our Exclusives portfolio as well as dedicated production
lines for Performance Materials. Jayhawk produces active ingredients and Intermediates for the Crop Science and
Life Science end-markets. Jayhawk also produces Specialties and Performance Materials products for high growth
markets. Our Specialties products have high-performance applications, e.g., in electronics. As a result of acquiring
our Jayhawk production facility in 2019, we have gained additional U.S. exposure and have gained further fine
chemicals customers beyond the agrochemicals market. This, we believe, has positioned us as the only major Crop
Science CDMO with a transatlantic footprint.

**_Knapsack_**

Our Knapsack site located near Cologne, Germany, has been in production since 1949 and covers approximately
10,900 square meters. It is situated in a chemical industrials park with transportation connections to Western and
Central Europe and access to North Sea shipping routes by rail, highway and waterway. Our Knapsack facility
uses chlorination and hydrogenation technology to produce MCA and SMCA. Chlorine and hydrogen are sourced
via pipeline under a supply agreement from our supplier’s adjacent facilities. The facility has a two-line production
process, which allows for maintenance and repair activities, and produces multiple purity grades of MCA as liquid,
solutions and flakes.

**_Gersthofen_**

Our Gersthofen site, situated in the Gersthofen Industrial Park located approximately 60 kilometers northwest of
Munich near Augsburg, Germany, has been in production since 1905 and occupies approximately 31,500 square
meters. The facility has multiple production lines and produces multiple purity grades of MCA and as well as
proprietary ingredients of our Specialties portfolio focusing mainly on pharmaceutical and Life Science
applications. Our Gersthofen facility produces chlorine on-site using backward integrated chlor-alkali membrane
electrolysis technology, offering backward integration for MCA as well as for our Specialties products. The
chlorine production generates by-products such as caustic soda, which is sold to third-party customers or reacted
with acetic acid to produce sodium acetate. In December 2019, we upgraded the Gersthofen plant with the latest
and most efficient membrane technology allowing for additional capacity and continuous energy saving.

**_Jining, Shandong Province_**

We acquired our site in China in 2014 following the establishment of our joint venture with Jining Jinwei Gold
Power in 2013. The production facility is centrally located in Northeast China in the Shandong Province west of
Beijing and Shanghai. We replaced the original technical grade MCA plant in 2016 with a high-purity grade MCA
plant making use of our differentiating hydrogenation technology and allowing us to serve premium international
customers. We benefit from a stable supply of chlorine from a nearby large (electrolysis) chlorine plant owned
and operated by our joint venture partner, with CABB GmbH owning 68% of the share capital in the joint venture.

**Sources and Availability of Raw Materials**

Some of our customer contracts by sales include price formulas that allow for partial pass-through of price
variations in acetic acid and acetic anhydride. These pass-through provisions help to limit significant fluctuations
in our cost of sales but often include a time lag. The remaining revenue from the sale is contracted at spot prices
that reflect current prices for raw materials, which mitigates our exposure to fluctuations in raw materials prices.

For tailor-made products, raw materials for production are provided by our customers or, where we are responsible
for the procurement of raw materials, our customer contracts may include pass-through clauses for raw materials,
thereby providing a certain degree of protection from fluctuations in prices of raw materials.

Purchases of raw materials primarily consist of acetic acid, acetic anhydride, chlorine and energy. The chlorine
production process based on chlor-alkali electrolysis at our Gersthofen and Pratteln production facilities requires

117


-----

significant amounts of electricity. At our Knapsack plant, we purchase chlorine via pipeline pursuant to a supply
contract from Vinnolit, whose chlorine production facility is adjacent to ours. Similarly, our joint venture in China
sources its chlorine requirements from our joint venture partner, who operates an adjacent chlorine production
facility.

As part of our quality control management procedures, we maintain long-term relationships with suppliers for
large parts of the portfolio. We also conduct ongoing performance assessment and benchmarking as part of our
supplier selection process. In the event of supply shortages, we may seek to purchase raw materials or other
products from our competitors. From time to time, we also enter into product swap agreements with key
competitors to guarantee that our customers can be supplied at all times, even during facility maintenance or
turnarounds. While temporary shortages of raw materials could occasionally occur, we generally have access to
sufficient raw materials to cover current and projected requirements.

**Distribution and Logistics**

Our distribution and logistics team is responsible for organizing and coordinating the delivery of products to our
global customer base as well as intra-group logistics.

We serve customers through three distribution models: (i) bulk shipments mainly via tank container and rail cars,
(ii) packaged goods (e.g., coated drums, big bags, etc.,) and (iii) via pipeline.

For bulk shipments, we currently have a large in-house managed leased fleet covering tank containers and railcars
to transport demanding materials (e.g., melts, corrosive liquids) to our customers. We provide state-of-the-art
supply solutions to our customers through GPS tracking of shipments and a modern container fleet, including our
leased titanium railcars for transporting MCA which are 40% lighter than regular railcars and can capture 30%
more product volumes.

For packaged goods, we also supply customers with, for example, coated drums and super sacks. We operate
semi-automated drum filling lines in our product sites in Pratteln and Gersthofen to target high margin niche
segments mainly for Advanced Intermediates and Specialties as well as in semi-automated filling lines for MCA
flakes and salts in big bags and super sacks at our plants in Gersthofen and Knapsack.

For pipeline customers, we distribute Base Chemicals to customers adjacent to our production sites mainly in
Pratteln. We recently finished a new pipeline to supply a Specialty product with high margin and growth potential
to a Life Science customer near Pratteln.

Part of our required distribution and transportation services are outsourced to external providers.

**Sales and Marketing**

We market and sell our products by using both a direct sales force and leveraging our strong relationships with
our customers, local agents and distributors to provide high-quality products globally. We employ a sales force of
employees that comprises two sales teams: one for the Specialties and Exclusives product group and one for the
Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group.

In our Exclusive and Specialties product group, we use key account managers that seek new projects and ensure
our customers are treated well and that there are no issues on existing products and new projects. For Specialties
in particular, the team also performs lifecycle management, assessing whether certain products are coming to the
end of the lifespan and could be replaced by more profitable products or higher grade purification.

In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products, our marketing teams work on getting the best
volume/value ratio by understanding markets and reacting to market changes as well as developing new products.

We also work with a network of independent sales agents and distributors to ensure broad international coverage
and limited fixed costs to us. However, the majority of our current sales are direct sales to customers.

**Research and Development**

Our research and development team’s activities are primarily focused on process development and process
optimization, including the reliable scaling up of production processes in close cooperation with our customers.
Currently, we do not engage in significant research projects outside of our business with customers.

118


-----

We utilize our many years of experience with a variety of technologies in order to develop and implement the
most efficient processes. Furthermore, product efficiency is monitored after the product rollout in order to further
optimize the process. Process optimization measures are focused on improving yield, reducing raw materials used,
recycling solvents and raw materials, preventing waste, improving throughout and ensuring statistical process
controls.

The majority of such activities are related to the developing and the scale up of synthesis processes associated
with new products. Until production start, the research and development department is responsible for adapting
the production processes of the customer to efficient large-scale conditions within our production environment.
This is only possible by conducting detailed patent research beforehand, extensive lab studies, safety assessments,
the creation of mass balances, and the production of samples which are analyzed and confirmed by the customer.
In addition, the research and development department consults with other departments for the creation of product
specifications, production concepts and process descriptions, as well as for aligning with the customer on
analytical methods for quality control. The remainder are related to process optimization initiatives aimed at
increasing productivity.

Overall, our research and development and technical capabilities support our customers across their product life
cycle. Our solutions enable our customers to up-scale and facilitate technology transfers. During the product
launch phase, many of our customers develop their commercial production protocols based on our deep technical
expertise. Our research expertise also enables our customers to rapidly up-scale from the laboratory to commercial
sales. In terms of life cycle support, we advise our customers on process optimization and de-bottlenecking
solutions. We have a proven track record in terms of delivering significant productivity gains to our customers.

**Information Technology**

We run a number of IT systems to support our business operations. We have implemented application-specific
measures such as stable and redundantly-designed IT systems, backup processes, virus and access protection and
encryption systems as well as standardized IT infrastructure and applications. We regularly test and update our IT
systems. In addition, our employees receive regular training on information and data protection. Risk management
related to IT systems and applications is conducted using standardized regulations as well as an internal control
system.

**Intellectual Property**

As of December 31, 2022, we owned or had the right to six patents as well as six trademarks or trade names related
to our business. We believe that our trademarks are of value to our business, but no one trademark is material to
our business as a whole. We rely on the differentiating nature of certain of our production processes and
technological knowhow and enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect
our knowhow and intellectual property. We do not own the intellectual property rights over the customer exclusive
products we manufacture. Our customer contracts for the manufacture of patented products or products otherwise
protected by intellectual property include strict confidentiality provisions.

**Insurance**

We maintain liability, property, directors’ and officers’ and other insurance coverage with coverage limits we
consider consistent with industry practice. We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the nature
of the risks covered and amounts insured for our business operations. However, our insurance coverage does not
cover all potential risks associated with our business or for which we may otherwise be liable, as it is not possible
to obtain meaningful coverage at reasonable rates for certain types of risks, such as certain types of environmental
hazards. Consequently, we cannot guarantee that we will not suffer a loss or losses which are not covered by our
insurance policies or which may be in excess of the amount of our insurance coverage. In addition, longer
interruptions of operations in one or more of our facilities can, even if insured, result in loss of sales, profit,
customers and market share.

119

**Employees**

The following table sets forth our annual average number of employees by division as of December 31, 2020,
2021 and 2022:

**As of December 31,**
**2020** **2021** **2022**
Production and Technology ........................................................... 954 978 1,005
Research and Development ............................................................ 25 27 26
Administration and Sales ............................................................... 148 157 161
**Total ..............................................................................................** **1,127** **1,162** **1,192**

We have not suffered any material work stoppages or strikes in recent decades.

Certain of our employees are represented by works councils (Betriebsrat). Works councils have various
information, consultation and co-determination rights. For example, they must be notified in advance of any
employee layoffs, must consent to hirings and relocations of employees and are granted co-determination rights
in social matters, such as work schedules and rules of conduct. In addition, certain of our employees in Finland,
Switzerland, the United States and Germany are members of trade unions.

We are subject to mandatory labor agreements (Tarifverträge) with most of our employees in our German
production facilities. As German law prohibits asking employees whether they are members of unions, we do not
know how many of our employees are unionized. In general, our employees in Germany fall within the scope of
the German Dismissal Protection Act (Kündigungsschutzgesetz), which limits our ability to terminate individual
employment relationships unilaterally. We also comply with the German Anti-Discrimination Act (Allgemeines
_Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) and comparable legislation in other countries in which we operate._

**Environmental, Health and Safety Matters**

We are committed to integrating environmental protection and socially responsible conduct into our business
operations. Therefore, we not only comply with all applicable laws and voluntary obligations but continuously
strive to improve our performance and management systems, for example, as part of our ‘fit-for-future’ program
and therefore analyze potential risks and implementation of countermeasures on a regular basis. Our integrated
quality and environmental management systems are certified according to the established standards ISO 9001 and
ISO 14001. Due to the growing importance of energy efficiency, CABB GmbH has additionally implemented an
energy management system in accordance with DIN IS0 50001. We are also pursuing similar standards and targets
for energy savings at CABB AG in Switzerland to ensure constant top-in-class performance and governmental
support and subsidies. In addition, a systematic prevention approach to food safety (HACCP) has been
implemented in Gersthofen for some relevant products, and we achieved the corresponding ISO 22001 (food
additive sodium acetate) certification. Our strong commitment to high environmental, health and safety standards
is demonstrated by our incident rate having decreased by 40% since 2017.

Our operations involve the use, processing, handling, storage and transportation of materials that are subject to
numerous supranational, national and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Our production
facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. We could incur significant costs,
including fines, penalties and other sanctions, third-party claims and environmental cleanup costs as a result of
violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or operational permits
required thereunder. We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Although our management systems and practices are
designed to achieve and maintain compliance with laws and regulations, future developments and increasingly
stringent regulation could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental, health and safety and product
safety and content expenditures or changes to our operations or products. See “⸺Environmental, Health and
_Safety Matters.”_

**ESG and Sustainability**

We have made ESG one of our corporate priorities and consider it to be a key element of our business’ success.
Due to the nature of our business and our position as a business partner deeply integrated in our customers’ supply
chain, we are aware of the importance of ESG in daily operations as our performance directly translates into the
value chain of our partners.

120


-----

We have underlined our ESG strategy by committing to seven UN sustainable development goals, signing the UN
Global Compact and the Responsible Care initiative and we our corporate programs are based on external
standards and assessments. In 2022, we became a member of the “Together for Sustainability” initiative, a
collaboration of operating chemical companies that are committed to sustainability throughout their value chains.

Furthermore, our commitment to ESG is reflected by our twelve sustainability targets, comprising of twelve
targets by 2025 and 2030, respectively, across the following six topics which we have identified as particularly
relevant for our Group and our stakeholders:

  - Climate

  - Energy

  - Products

  - Society

  - People

  - Water

**_Environmental_**

We consider environmental protection and sustainability to be one of the pillars of our ESG strategy. We
contribute to environmental protection and sustainability in various ways, including through operational efficiency
(i.e., minimizing negative environmental impacts), creation of cost advantages in production and by driving
innovation.

We are constantly working on solutions to reduce energy consumption and to optimize energy efficiency, in
particular electricity and steam consumption (excluding the power used in our electrolysis plants). Highly
specialized measures such as optimized energy usage in distillation, energy-efficient technology for chloralkali
electrolysis or measuring energy consumption more accurately with software are helping us to reduce the amount
of energy we need for our operations.

We believe we operate a highly efficient circular economy production processes and by optimizing product yields
and reusing materials within product cycles. For example, the raw materials used in our “Verbund” plant in our
site in Pratteln, chlorine and sulfur trioxide, are not only used to manufacture chlorination and sulfonation
reagents, but also to produce further downstream intermediates and active ingredients. The “Verbund” plant
enables the separation of the off-gases HCI and SO2 which are separated, purified and recycled, reused or sold.

Our sites undergo regular audits by Eco-Vadis, the world’s largest provider of sustainability ratings. In the latest
ratings conducted in 2022, our site in Kokkola was awarded the platinum rating and our site in Pratteln
(Switzerland) as well as the sites in Germany and China were awarded with the gold rating. As part of the audit
report, EcoVadis also provides valuable input on areas in which CABB can continue to improve, and we have
developed strategies and set key targets to achieve these possible improvements.

Operationally, we are employing the newest technology to improve efficiency. The acquisition of new
compressors at the German Knapsack site in May 2021 is another example of how we are using energy in a more
targeted manner. Compressed air generation is now distributed between two smaller compressors instead of one
central machine. Before, all the air used to be compressed to the highest pressure required and then depressurized
for other processes, now however, compressed air can be generated directly at the requisite pressure level as
needed. This reduces the energy consumption by around 30% in the relevant processes. Another tool at our
disposal is the use of even more energy efficient technology. For example, as part of a planned overhaul at the
turn of 2019/20220, the electrolysis plants at the German Gersthofen site were upgraded to the latest technology,
allowing the membranes to be positioned between the electrodes without any spacing (“zero-gap technology”),
with the resulting higher current densities between the electrodes driving significant improvement in electrical
efficiency. We are also focusing on renewables with our Finnish Kokkola plant being fully powered by
hydroelectricity since January 2020. On the other side, our USA Jayhawk plant sources 40% of its electricity from
regionally generated wind energy. Most recently, we committed to invest into a CO2 neutral office building in our
site in Kokkola and further committed to reduce our absolute CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 30 ktons by 2025
(against 2019 baseline).

121


-----

In addition to our goals to lower our CO2 emissions, we are working to significantly reduce specific energy
consumption (mainly electricity and steam consumption). Furthermore, our energy management at our German
production sites are certified in accordance with ISO 50001:2018, with top marks once again awarded following
an external audit in 2021. Standard compliance was met in all areas and even exceeded in six of eight standard
clauses. To achieve this ISO certification, the energy management system must prove its standard compliance in
an annual surveillance audit and a three-year recertification audit.

**_Social_**

Social responsibility is another pillar of our sustainability strategy. We deeply are integrated into our customers’
value chains and therefore work closely with our partners. We constantly invest in new infrastructure and our
local supply options enables not only the optimization of our own processes, but also those of our customers.

Soliciting feedback from our stakeholders is an important path when striving for excellence: On a regular basis,
we conduct customer audits, customer surveys, third-party audits and employee surveys. Our last customer survey
in 2021, for example, showed high customer satisfaction (75% “4” and “5” out of 5 categories). We are aware of
the important role each of our employees play in our success. We therefore offer multiple training possibilities to
offer our employees the change to advance, for example, via site-specific trainings. We conduct employee surveys
on a regular basis. Furthermore, we offer multiple vocational trainings opportunities or job fairs to attract young
talent and maintain a rigorous culture of health and safety. In 2022, our lost time accident rate (LTAR) was 10%
lower than the industry benchmark of the United States OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)
and we set ourselves the target to be 60% lower than the benchmark by 2025.

Diversity and inclusion is a top priority in CABB. In April 2021, our CEO signed our “Diversity Charter” which
aims to further promote diversity and equality of opportunities at our workplace.

**_Governance_**

We have created a governance structure to promote responsibility and accountability for ESG and sustainability
matters within the Group. We set up a compliance management system, including an external ‘ombudsman’ to
which employees can anonymously report (“whistleblowing”), to implement and track measures and key
performance indicators with respect to ESG. We have alignment structures in place, such as regular employee
trainings, that we believe will allow us to further progress in our ESG and sustainability efforts.

**Legal and Regulatory Proceedings**

We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently involved
in any legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any threatened claims against us, which we expect to have a material
adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

**REGULATION, ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS**

**Overview**

Our business is subject to numerous laws, rules and regulations at supranational, national, state and municipal
levels as well as technical and management standards in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We expect that, in many of the countries in which we do business, the applicable laws, rules and regulations,
including environmental laws and regulations, will become more comprehensive and stringent over time. We
further expect that many environmental laws and regulations will continue to be harmonized at the EU level over
the near-to-medium-term. Member states will, however, remain free to adopt laws and regulations that are more
stringent than those required by the European Union. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may
result in civil liability, fines or even criminal sanctions.

As the applicable regulatory framework and technical standards are subject to revision and continuous
development, it is very difficult to accurately predict the future cost of compliance with such regulatory
requirements and technical standards. Additional or more stringent laws, rules, regulations and technical standards
could increase our costs or limit our ability to continue our business operations in the same manner as we have
done in the past. See “Risk Factors.”

The following provides only a brief overview of certain selected areas of regulation applicable to our business
operations.

**Regulation Relating to our Business**

**_Regulation of Chemicals European Union_**

REACH

The manufacturing, handling, use and trading of chemicals is regulated in the EU and its member states. The EU
requires control of the use of chemical products within its borders, requiring all affected industries to ensure and
demonstrate the safe manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. “REACH” is the Regulation concerning the
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006), which
came into effect on June 1, 2007, and which has been fully applicable since June 1, 2009, requiring the registration
of all chemical substances or preparations manufactured in, or imported into, the EU. Its main objectives include
improving the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals and
ensuring the free circulation of substances on the internal market of the EU.

In principle, under REACH, all manufacturers and importers of chemicals must identify and manage risks linked
to the substances they manufacture and market. For substances produced or imported in quantities of one ton or
more per year per company, manufacturers and importers need to demonstrate that they have appropriately done
so by means of a registration dossier, which shall be submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”).
ECHA may then check that the dossier is compliant with REACH and will evaluate testing proposals to ensure
that the proposed assessment of the chemical substances will not result in unnecessary testing, especially on
animals. Where appropriate, authorities may also select substances of concern for a broader evaluation.

REACH requires formal documentation of the relevant data required for hazard assessments for each substance
registered as well as development of risk assessments for their registered uses. Under certain circumstances, the
performance of a chemical safety assessment is mandatory and a chemical safety report assuring the safe use of
the substance must be submitted. If there is no registration of the substance, it is impermissible to produce this
chemical in, or import it into, the EU (i.e., the ‘no data no market’ principle). Existing registrations need to be
reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated with respect to new scientific knowledge. Furthermore, purchasers of
registered chemicals must inform their sellers about the intended use of the chemicals, as the importer or producer
must add this information to its documentation.

REACH also provides for an authorization system aiming to ensure that substances of very high concern are
adequately controlled and progressively substituted by safer substances or technologies or only used where society
benefits overall from using the substance. These substances are prioritized and gradually listed on the so-called
candidate list for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV to REACH. Once they are included, the industry has to submit
applications to ECHA on authorization for continued use of these substances which are otherwise prohibited. In
addition, EU authorities can impose restrictions on the manufacture, use or placing on the market of substances
causing an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment.

123


-----

Manufacturers and importers must provide their downstream users with the risk information they need to be able
to use the substance safely. This is done via the classification and labeling system and Safety Data Sheets (SDS).
Therefore, the REACH Regulation was accompanied by legislation providing for a comprehensive system on the
classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 and
related European legislation).

We produce and use considerable quantities of substances that are subject to the REACH regulation. We believe
that we have complied with our current obligations under REACH. As part of a large consortium, the Group is a
co-registrant of registrations for chlorine, glycolic acid, MCA, SMCA and sodium hypochlorite. None of our
products affected by substances of very high concern (“SVHC”) are listed in the official SVHC-List of the ECHA.

As part of the “European Green Deal”, in 2020 the European Commission announced the launch of a “Chemicals
Strategy for Sustainability” and a “Zero Pollution Action Plan”, which provided for a revision of REACH. This
included, in particular, the approach that the most harmful chemicals should only be allowed if their use was
necessary for health, safety or critical for the functioning of society and if there were no alternatives acceptable
from the standpoint of environment and health. The Commission’s proposal was subject to comprehensive and
controversial discussions with stakeholders and the Commision pushed back the revision of REACH to the last
quarter of 2023. A revision of the CLP Regulation is currently in the legislative process. It includes, in particular,
new hazard classes for endocrine disruptors and other harmful chemical substances with the aim to better protect
humans and the environment from hazardous chemicals.

Our biocidal business is particularly regulated by the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012 (“BPR”),
which entered into force on September 1, 2013. Biocidal products are used to protect humans, animals, materials
or articles against harmful organisms, like pests or bacteria. Under the BPR, the approval of active substances
takes place at the EU level and the subsequent authorization of the biocidal products at the EU member state level.
Companies have to apply for the approval of an active substance by submitting a dossier to the ECHA. Following
the approval of an active substance, companies wishing to place biocidal products on the market in an EU member
state have to apply for product authorization. We carefully monitor our compliance with the BPR and are not
aware of any infringements in connection with our operations or products.

The use of pesticides in the EU is regulated by the Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant
protection products on the market and other EU legislative acts (such as the Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on
maximum residue levels (MRL) of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and the Directive
2009/128/EC establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides,
commonly referred to as the Sustainable Pesticide Use Directive). In June 2022, the European Commission
presented a proposal for a regulation on the sustainable use of pesticides, which would repeal and replace the
Sustainable Pesticide Use Directive. The proposal sets legally binding targets at EU level to reduce by 50% the
use and the risk of chemical pesticides as well as the use of the more hazardous pesticides by 2030, in line with
the EU’s Farm to Fork strategy. According to the draft regulation, member states would have some flexibility in
setting their own binding national reduction targets within defined parameters, allowing account to be taken of
national situations. The proposal would ban the use of all pesticides in sensitive areas. The legislative procedure
is still pending in the European Parliament and the Council.

_Germany_

We are, inter alia, subject to various notification and labeling requirements and have to comply with certain safety
obligations arising under the German Chemicals Act (Chemikaliengesetz), which mainly reflects and accompanies
REACH at the national level, but which also establishes further national requirements. As the production and
handling of chemicals is the Group’s core business, these obligations are of significant importance for its
operations.

The Ordinance on Information Requirements relating to Poisonous Substances (Giftinformationsverordnung) was
released under the German Chemicals Act. It requires persons who market certain chemical products, in particular
biocidal products, to provide information needed for precautionary safety and curative measures and emergency
situations.

The Ordinance on the Prohibition of Certain Hazardous Substances (Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung) bans or
restricts the marketing of dangerous materials, preparations, and products. This ordinance contains requirements
that must be complied with when marketing dangerous materials, such as proof of competence and notification,
information and recording duties.

124


-----

_Switzerland_

We are subject to various notification, labeling and marketing requirements under Swiss law and must comply
with certain safety obligations arising under, among others, the Federal Chemicals Act (Bundesgesetz _über Schutz_
_vor gefährlichen Stoffen und Zubereitungen, Chemikaliengesetz), which (apart from the product registration_
requirements) is by large compatibly harmonized with REACH but is developed and applied autonomously), the
Ordinance on Hazardous Substances (Verordnung über Schutz vor gefährlichen Stoffen und Zubereitungen,
_Chemikalienverordnung), the Ordinance on Biocide Products (Verordnung über das Inverkehrbringen von und_
_den Umgang mit Biozidprodukten, Biozidprodukteverordnung), which is largely harmonized to the BPR and the_
Chemical Risk Reduction Ordinance (Verordnung zur Reduktion von Risiken beim Umgang mit bestimmten
_besonders gefährlichen Stoffen, Zubereitungen und Gegenständen, Chemikalien-Risikoreduktions-Verordnung),_
which prohibits or restricts the marketing and use of certain hazardous substances and similarly broadly tracks the
corresponding EU regulations.

_Finland_

We are, inter alia, subject to notification and labeling requirements and have to comply with certain safety
obligations arising under the Finnish Chemicals Act (Kemikaalilaki). This legislation mainly reflects and
accompanies REACH at the national level in Finland, but also establishes further national requirements.

_United States_

TSCA imposes requirements on persons and companies that manufacture, process, distribute, use or dispose of
regulated chemicals. Among other things, under TSCA the United States EPA has the authority to: (i) require
testing of chemicals; (ii) undertake pre-market review and impose restrictions upon new chemicals; (iii) limit or
prohibit the manufacture, use, distribution and disposal of chemical substances; (iv) impose reporting and
recordkeeping requirements; and (v) regulate the export and import of chemical substances. The EPA may impose
civil and criminal liability for TSCA violations.

In June 2016, legislation significantly amending TSCA was enacted into law, entitled the ‘Frank R. Lautenberg
Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act’. The legislation mandates that the EPA conduct safety evaluations for
all chemicals in active commerce and determine that new chemicals and significant new uses of chemicals are not
likely to present an unreasonable risk before entering the market. Additional risk screening of certain of our
products by the EPA could lead to new or more stringent regulatory obligations and/or restrictions, including,
potentially, prohibitions on manufacture and sale of certain products. On December 19, 2016, the EPA published
a list of ten chemical substances that were the subject of the EPA’s initial chemical risk evaluations, as required
by TSCA, which were completed by January 2021 and EPA designated 20 chemical substances as high priority
in 2019 for upcoming risk evaluations. Such regulations could result in key raw materials, chemicals, or other
substances being classified or reclassified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment,
users of our products, or our employees. Such reclassification of one or more of our raw materials or products
could affect its availability or marketability, result in a ban on its purchase or sale, or require us to incur increased
costs to comply with notification, labelling, or handling requirements.

In addition, all pesticide products sold in the United States must comply with FIFRA and most must be registered
with the EPA and similar state agencies. The use of certain pesticide products is also regulated by the EPA in
addition to various local, state and federal environmental and/or public health agencies. These regulations may,
for example, include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product, that certain products
be used only on certain types of locations, that users post notices on properties to which products have been or
will be applied, or that may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the
future, or may ban the use of certain ingredients or categories of products altogether. Our inability to obtain or
maintain such registrations, or the cancellation of any such registration of our products, could have an adverse
effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on a variety of factors, including the product(s)
involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. We
attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute active
ingredients, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid or reduce these risks.

In addition, numerous state, local and industry groups have implemented so-called green chemistry or similar
chemicals-focused initiatives to identify, prioritize, and restrict existing chemicals. The U.S. Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has phased in a hazard communication regulation intended to harmonize
the U.S. system of Material Safety Data sheet hazard information with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized

125


-----

System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. Other similar future changes to chemicals regulation in the
U.S. could place additional substantial regulatory burdens on the industry.

Food Ingredients and Feed Additives

_European Union_

With regard to our business on vitamins, we are subject to European and national law on food safety providing
for special obligations on the production, marketing, sale and labeling of food ingredients. For example,
Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 sets out the general principles of EU food ingredient law and requires, among other
things, that food and feed ingredients be traceable to their source. Detailed rules also exist for the authorization of
novel foods within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 on novel foods as well as food ingredients based
on genetically modified organisms within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 on genetically modified
food and feed.

In addition, there are a number of regulations relating to food improvement agents, including provisions and
authorization procedures relating to food additives, food enzymes and flavoring, as well as food ingredients with
flavoring properties. Specific limits exist for the use of pesticides and other contaminants, such as dioxins,
polychlorinated biphenyl (“PCB”), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and mycotoxins in
foodstuffs, foods and food ingredients. Separate legislation regulates the additives that may be used in the
manufacture of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.

When used as food additives, our products may be required to comply with certain sector specific regulations,
such as the European Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives objecting at a high level of consumer
health protection by restricting the use of food additives.

Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs sets out criteria for the measures and conditions
necessary to control hazards and to ensure a sufficient state for human consumption of a foodstuff taking into
account its intended use. Under the regulation, food business operators have to satisfy certain hygiene
requirements by, among other things, notifying the competent authority, in the manner specified, of each
establishment under its control that carries out any of the stages of production, processing and distribution of food,
with a view to the registration of each such establishment. Moreover, each food business operator is obligated to
put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures based on the “HACCP” (Hazard
analysis and critical control points) principles.

Regulation (EC) No. 1831/2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition sets out rules for authorizing feed additives
and placing them on the market. A revision was announced by the Commission in 2021. The aim of the proposal
is to contribute to a more sustainable food production system by establishing new criteria to promote the
authorization of feed additives with positive effects on animal welfare and on the environment. The legislative
proposal is expected in 2023.

_Germany_

In addition to European regulations, EU member states may have enacted further national legislation on regulation
of food and feed stuff. For example, the German Food and Feed Code (Lebensmittel- und Futtermittelgesetzbuch)
primarily aims to protect consumers from food and feed stuff related health risks. It also applies to the production
and distribution of cosmetics. The German Ordinance on Animal Nutrition (Futtermittelverordnung) refers to this
register and sets forth various specific rules.

_Finland_

In addition to the applicable EU regulation, food and feed safety, food quality assurance, hygiene of food stuffs
and food labelling are regulated by the Food Act (Elintarvikelaki), which was renewed and entered into force in
April 2021 and the Decree of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on the Provision of Food Information to
Consumers (Maa- ja metsätalousministeriön asetus elintarviketietojen antamisesta kuluttajille).

_Switzerland_

The Federal Act on Foodstuffs and Utility Articles (Bundesgesetz über Lebensmittel und Gebrauchsgegenstände,
_Lebensmittelgesetz) aims, inter alia, to protect consumer health and provide consumer information. A detailed_
framework of ordinances is in place for food or nutrition, its components and additives.

126


-----

_United States_

In the United States, ingredients and additives used in both conventional (human) food and animal feed are subject
to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) and other state and local regulatory authorities, which regulate, among other things, the
manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising,
promotion, distribution, safety, and/or adverse event reporting of food products. The FDA regulates such products
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), which defines the term “food” to include, among
other things, any articles used for food or drink in man or other animals – such as conventional foods, livestock
feed and companion animal food – as well as any components of such articles, such as raw materials ingredients
and additives.

Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the FDCA, any substance that is reasonably expected to become a component
of food or otherwise affect the characteristics of food (including any substance intended for use in producing,
manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food) is deemed a
“food additive,” and is therefore subject to FDA premarket review and approval, unless the substance is generally
recognized among qualified experts as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures or – in the
case of a substance used prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food – to be safe
under the conditions of its intended use, a standard referred to as “generally recognized as safe.” An animal food
ingredient that is recognized in an official Feed Ingredient Definition in the Official Publication published by the
Association of American Feed Control Officials (“AAFCO”) is presumed to have met the “generally recognized
as safe” standard for the intended use specified in the Feed Ingredient Definition. AAFCO is a voluntary
membership association of federal and state agencies that regulate the sale and distribution of animal food.
Although AAFCO is not a governmental body and has no official regulatory authority, it is comprised of
stakeholders to develop and implement uniform laws, regulations, standards, definitions, and enforcement polices
for regulating the manufacture, labeling, distribution and sale of animal food. Most states enforce their own animal
feed laws and regulations, many of which are based on model definitions and guidelines developed by AAFCO.
The degree of oversight of the implementation of these regulations varies by state, but numerous state frameworks
require a state governmental authority review and approval of each product label as a condition of sale in that
state, and in some cases, of the constituents or ingredients in the animal feed, prior to authorizing the marketing
or distribution of the animal feed or ingredient in that state.

In the event the FDA or a state regulatory authority identifies unsanitary conditions, false or misleading labeling,
or any other violation of applicable FDA or state laws or regulations, potential consequences include, among other
things: warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging,
total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines (including criminal fines), civil
penalties or criminal prosecution.

The FDA regulations cover drugs, which the FDA generally defines to mean articles intended for use in the
diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of diseases or other conditions, or that are intended to affect
the structure or function of the body of man or other animals. Certain of our compounds may be used as active
ingredients in certain anti-aging, acne, sun care or other products that are regulated by the FDA as nonprescription, Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) drugs in the United States. Such OTC drug products are generally subject
to regulation pursuant to the FDA’s OTC Drug review process (“OTC Drug Monographs”) which provide rules
applicable to each therapeutic category of non-prescription drug, and establish conditions, such as active
ingredients, uses (indications), doses, routes of administration, labeling, and testing procedures, under which an
OTC drug within that particular therapeutic category may be generally recognized as safe and effective
(“GRASE”), and therefore can be marketed without obtaining pre-market approval of a new drug application
(“NDA”) or abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). To be legally marketed, among other things, OTC drug
products marketed under an OTC monograph must be manufactured in compliance with the OTC Drug
Monographs and FDA’s good manufacturing practice requirements for drug products, and the failure to maintain
compliance with these requirements could lead to FDA enforcement action. Moreover, a failure to comply with
the OTC monograph requirements could also lead the FDA to determine that the drug is not GRASE, and thus is
a “new drug” requiring premarket review and approval in accordance with the NDA or ANDA processes, or to
make changes to its manufacturing processes or product formulations or labels. Any failure to comply with any
requirements applicable to OTC drugs can result in potential consequences that include, among other things:
warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or
partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines (including criminal fines), civil penalties
or criminal prosecution.

Cosmetics

_European Union_

Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, which came into effect on July 11, 2013, requires producers
to carry out a safety assessment of cosmetics and their ingredients prior to their sale on the market. The same
regulation also contains lists of substances that are prohibited or restricted in connection with the manufacturing
of cosmetics.

As part of the “Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability”, a revision of Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 is planned
by the Commission in order to better protect the environment and human health. The revision may, in particular,
strengthen the requirements for risk management and safety assessments.

_Germany_

In addition to applicable EU regulations, the German Food and Feed Code (Lebensmittel- und
_Futtermittelgesetzbuch) described above also applies to articles of daily use, such as cosmetics. The German_
Regulation on Cosmetic Products (Verordnung über kosmetische Mittel) stipulates additional notification and
labeling requirements for cosmetics.

_Finland_

In addition to applicable EU regulations, the Finnish Act on Cosmetic Products (Laki kosmeettisista valmisteista)
is also applicable to cosmetics. The Act mainly reflects the European Regulation, but also sets out further sanctions
and criminal liability for breaches of the Act or the European Regulation.

_Switzerland_

The Federal Act on Foodstuffs and Utility Articles (Bundesgesetz über Lebensmittel und Gebrauchsgegenstände,
_Lebensmittelgesetz), described above, also applies on articles of daily use, such as cosmetics. Specific ordinances,_
such as the Ordinance on Cosmetics (Verordnung des Eidgenössischen Departement des Inneren über
_kosmetische Mittel) further detail and implement the respective provisions._

_United States_

In the United States, cosmetic products and their ingredients are subject to regulation by the FDA and FTC as
well as various other state and local authorities. The FDCA generally defines cosmetics as articles or components
of articles intended for application to the human body to cleanse, beautify, promote attractiveness, or alter the
appearance, but not by affecting the structure or function of the body. The FDA’s cosmetic requirements govern,
among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling,
packaging, storage, disposal recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import
of such products. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA; however, certain ingredients,
such as color additives, must be pre-approved for the specific intended use in the product and are subject to certain
restrictions on their use. The FDA may, by regulation, require warning statements on certain cosmetic products
for specified hazards associated with such products. FDA regulations also prohibit or otherwise restrict the use of
certain types of ingredients in cosmetic products.

In addition, the FDA requires that cosmetic labeling and claims be truthful and not misleading. Cosmetics may
not be marketed or labeled for their use in treating, preventing, mitigating, or curing diseases or other conditions
or in affecting the structure or function of the body, as such claims would render the product a drug and subject it
to regulation by FDA as a drug. The FDA evaluates the “intended use” of a product to determine whether it is a
drug, cosmetic product, or both, and considers labeling claims in determining the intended use of a product. The
FDA monitors compliance of cosmetic products through market surveillance and inspection of cosmetic
manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the products are not manufactured under unsanitary conditions, or
labeled in a false or misleading manner.

Under recent amendments to the law, manufacturers of cosmetic products will become subject to more onerous
obligations of the FDA, including adverse event reporting and record retention requirements, safety substantiation
requirements, facility registration requirements, and good manufacturing practice requirements. The FDA has also
been granted new enforcement authorities over cosmetics, such as mandatory recall authority, and there will be
new cosmetic labeling requirements imposed.

128


-----

In the event the FDA identifies unsanitary conditions, false or misleading labeling, or any other violation of FDA
laws or regulations, potential consequences include, among other things: warning letters or untitled letters; product
seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import; recalls or market withdrawals; injunctions; or the imposition
of civil or criminal penalties.

**Regulation of Manufacturing Sites and Storage Sites**

**_Emissions_**

_European Union_

In many countries, the emission of air pollutants, noise, odors and vibrations is governed by specific laws and
regulations. The operation of industrial facilities is typically subject to permits, and operators of these facilities
are required to prevent impermissible emissions. Operators of facilities are required to maintain all installations
in compliance with the respective permits in terms of the reduction of certain emissions and implementation of
safety measures. In some cases, a continuous improvement or retrofitting of installations to maintain facilities at
state-of-the-art safety standards may be required. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local
authorities and operators may be required to submit emission reports on a regular basis. Non-compliance with
maximum emission levels may result in administrative fines.

In January 2011, the European Directive 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions (“IED Directive”) entered into
force. It sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities and includes rules aimed
at reducing emissions into air, water and land, as well as preventing the generation of waste in order to achieve a
high level of overall environmental protection.

On April 5, 2022, the European Commission adopted a proposal to revise the IED Directive. In line with the
“European Green Deal”, the overall aim of this proposal is to progress towards the EU’s zero pollution ambition
for a toxic-free environment and to support climate, energy and circular economy policies. _Inter alia, the new_
rules aim to ensure full and consistent implementation of the IED Directive across member states, with tighter
permit controls on air and water emissions.

Under the IED Directive and its implementing law, inter alia, the chemical industry has to consider thresholds
regarding various polluting substances, such as carbon monoxide and dust including fine particulate matter.
Furthermore, the IED Directive amended European Directive 2008/1/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and
Control which aimed to define best available techniques (“BAT”) as binding standards. In order to define BAT
and the BAT-associated environmental performance at the EU level, the European Commission organizes an
exchange of information with experts from member states, industry and environmental organizations. This process
results in the publication of BAT Reference Documents (“BREFs”). BAT is a dynamic concept and continues to
evolve as new measures and techniques emerge, science and technologies develop and new or emerging industrial
processes are introduced. In order to reflect such developments and the consequences of such developments for
BAT, BREFs are subject to periodic review and update. That is why the IED Directive requires a periodical review
of all conditions in existing permits and, if necessary, amendments of these conditions to ensure compliance with
the IED Directive.

We continuously monitor compliance with the IED Directive and relevant BREFs on an ongoing basis. For
example, under the BREF for the production of chlor-alkali the mercury cell technology was phased out by the
end of 2017 and we converted our mercury cell plant in Pratteln to a membrane cell plant in 2016.

_Germany_

By way of amendments to member state laws, including, for example, the German Federal Emissions Control Act
(Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz), the German Federal Water Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz) and the German Act
on Recycling (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz), the IED Directive has been implemented in the EU member states,
resulting in thresholds, authorization requirements and supervisory obligations for new and existing facilities.
Although the IED Directive and its implementation provide transitional provisions, under German law, once a
new industry standard becomes binding, existing permits, which are not in compliance with such standard, will
not be grandfathered but will be adjusted with respect to the new, binding standard. In order to meet stricter
requirements, in particular for dust, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur monoxide and total organic carbon,
we may need to incur capital expenditures in order to improve our filter systems and firing processes.

129


-----

_Finland_

The IED Directive was implemented in Finland by the renewal of the Finnish Environmental Protection Act
(Ympäristönsuojelulaki) in 2014. As a result of the implementation, certain stricter environmental obligations for
polluters, more effective supervision of compliance and a supervision fee to be paid by parties holding an
environmental permit were included in the Environmental Act.

Finland’s first Climate Change Act (Ilmastolaki) entered into force in June 2015 and was renewed in 2022. In the
renewed Climate Change Act, national emission cut targets were introduced for 2030 (60%), 2040 (80%) and
2050 (90%) of the emission levels of 1990 in order to reach the general goal of Finland being carbon neutral in
3035. The law was further expanded to also apply to land use and targets regarding the strenghthening of carbon
sinks introduced. The Climate Change Act is, above all, intended as a law regarding the public administration’s
planning of climate policy. It may, however, impact other Finnish legislation directly regulating the operations of
the Finnish companies in the future.

_Switzerland_

The Federal Environmental Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Umweltschutz, Umweltschutzgesetz) and
implementing legislation aims to limit harmful impacts such as air and soil pollution, noise, vibrations, radiation,
water pollution or other interference in water, caused by the construction and operation of installations, by the
handling of substances, organisms or waste, or by the cultivation of the soil resulting, inter alia, in thresholds,
authorization requirements and supervisory obligations for new and existing facilities.

We continuously monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including with respect to permits that
are legally required to operate our sites. We anticipate that significant capital expenditures may become necessary
to upgrade production plants with new technical equipment to comply with maximum emission levels that may
become applicable in the future.

_United States_

The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and its implementing regulations, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations
govern emissions of pollutants into the air and impose permitting and emission control requirements. Standards
promulgated pursuant to the CAA may require that U.S. facilities install controls at, or make other changes to,
facilities. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be significant. In addition, failure
to comply with the requirements of the CAA and its implementing regulations could result in substantial fines,
civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions.

The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain permits for the construction, modification,
and operation of our equipment, comply with permit requirements, and incur capital expenditures for the
installation of certain air pollution control devices at our facilities. Measures may need to be taken to comply with
various regulations specific to our operations, such as: National Ambient Air Quality Standards applicable to
emissions of criteria pollutants such as particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and VOCs; and
the New Source Review program requiring that new or modified emissions sources install stringent control
technology. We may incur substantial capital expenditures to maintain compliance with these and other air
emission regulations that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future.

**_Climate Change and Emission Trading_**

At the international level, many nations have agreed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) pursuant
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”). These GHGs include methane,
a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, natural gas, and refined
petroleum products (among other sources). At the December 2015 Conference of the parties to the UNFCCC in
Paris, certain members of the international community negotiated a treaty known as the “Paris Agreement”,
which entered into force in November 2016. The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to keep a global temperature
rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the
temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. For this purpose, it requires signatory states to regularly
submit their national climate action plans, which in particular set out how those countries seek to reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. At the November 2022 Conference
of the Parties in Sharm El-Sheik, the signatory states were requested to strengthen their climate action plans, as
accelerated action was found to be necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.

In November 2021, the international community gathered again in Glasgow at the 26th Conference to the Parties
to the UNFCCC (“COP26”), during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to
eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs. COP26 concluded with the
finalization of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which stated long-term global goals (including those in the Paris
Agreement) aimed at limiting the increase in the global average temperature and reducing GHG emissions. These
goals were reaffirmed at the November 2022 27th Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (“COP27”).

_European Union_

In the European Union, the so-called “European Green Deal”, first presented by the European Commission in late
2019, seeks to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The “European Green Deal” serves as an
umbrella for a large number of strategies and policies to achieve climate neutrality, including significant revisions
of existing legislation. In this context, the Commission for instance adopted the so-called “Fit-for-55” package,
which includes a number of proposals to make the EU's climate, energy, land use, transport and taxation policies
fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The commitment
to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 is the EU's contribution to meeting the goals
of the Paris Agreement. The implementation of the “European Green Deal” is on-going, with numerous bills being
in the legislative process. Eventually, as a consequence of the “European Green Deal”, European industry is likely
to be facing a stricter regulatory framework throughout all sectors.

The “Fit-for-55” package provides, amongst others, for a revision of the EU’s Emissions Trading System (“EU
**ETS”). The EU ETS has been in operation since 2005 already, but the EU’s more ambitious goals in connection**
with the “Fit-for-55” package triggered the need for a revision. The relevant EU institution reached agreement on
the revision in December 2022, but the revised text has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the EU.

The EU ETS is based on the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC, which was transformed into national law
at the level of the EU member states. Through the introduction of a trading system for emission allowances, the
EU intended to considerably reduce the output of greenhouse gases.

The EU ETS covers about 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions and limits emissions from approximately
10,000 installations in the power sector, the manufacturing industry and commercial aviation between EU/EEA
countries. Industrial sites to which the EU Emission Trading System (“ETS”) applies must surrender allowances
for their greenhouse gas emissions. One allowance grants the right to emit one ton of greenhouse gases. The
allowances are put on the market by the EU member states via auctions. Industrial operators can buy the
allowances directly in such auctions or at a later stage on the secondary market. Sectors at risk of relocating their
production outside of the EU (so-called carbon leakage) can, to a certain extent, claim allocation of allowances
for free.

There is an overall cap of allowances put on the market per year, which is reduced annually in order to achieve a
gradual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under the currently applicable ETS, the EU-wide cap is lowered
annually by a linear factor of 2.2% of the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU
in the second trading period (2008 through 2012). In the recent discussions to revise the EU ETS Directive, the
relevant EU institutions agreed on a one-off reduction of the EU-wide quantity of allowances by 90 million in
2024 and by 27 million in 2026 respectively and on an annual reduction of the overall cap by 4.3% from 2024 to
27 and by 4.4% from 2028 to 2030.

The relevant institutions also agreed that, for a number of sectors at risk of carbon leakage, free allocation will be
phased out gradually over the coming years. Instead, those sectors will be subject to another system addressing
carbon leakage: the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (“CBAM”). The CBAM intends to equalise the price
of carbon between products manufactured within the EU and imported products. In practice, EU importers will
need to buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that they would have paid if they had
manufactured the products in the EU. As such, the CBAM aims at ensuring that the EU’s climate goals are not
undermined by the relocation of production sites to countries with less ambitious carbon reduction policies.

To date, the Group’s emissions have not exceeded the thresholds triggering the applicability of the ETS. However,
we closely observe the emission trading and its legal amendments by the EU as the thresholds may be decreased
by the European Union and the regime may become applicable to our operations in the future. At least one
amendment of the EU ETS Directive the relevant EU institutions agreed on will affect our business. This relates
to the establishment of an additional emissions trading scheme for emissions from buildings and road transport
and certain industrial sectors. The scheme will apply to the emissions caused by relevant fuel use. The actors

131


-----

obliged to buy allowances for those emissions will not be the consumers of the fuels, but the suppliers. However,
suppliers will hand down their costs to their customers, including us.

_Germany_

In Germany, the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC has been implemented by the German Greenhouse Gas
Emission Trading Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz), which provides the basis of the German emission
trading scheme. Moreover, plant operators are required to submit monitoring reports on a regular basis. In
addition, a national emissions trading scheme for combustibles was established by the Federal Act on the Trade
with Emissions caused by Combustibles (Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz) and has been in place since 2021.
Under this scheme, the suppliers of combustibles are obliged to buy allowances for the emissions that will be
generated by the incineration of the combustibles. In practice, the suppliers hand down the costs for the allowances
to their customers.

_Finland_

In Finland the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC has been implemented by the enactment of the Finnish
Emission Trading Act (Päästökauppalaki). Under the Act, certain plant operators have to apply for emissions
allowances, monitor emission levels and fulfil reporting duties towards the relevant authorities.

_Switzerland_

The Federal CO2 Act (Bundesgesetz über die Reduktion der CO2-Emissionen, CO2-Gesetz), inter alia, provides
for levies for the use of fossil fuels and energy sources for energy production as a measure to achieve the national
greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Exemptions are available for companies in certain industries obliged
or opting to participate in the Swiss emissions trading system (which is linked to the EU emissions trading system)
or entering into emission reduction undertakings with the Federal Government. Following the rejection of a
propsed revision of the CO2 Act in a popular referendum in June 2021, the Swiss Federal Council has published
a new proposal for a revised CO2 Act in September 2022. However, such revision has yet to pass parliament and,
potentially, a popular referendum. In the interim, the CO2 Act has been updated to align the reduction target with
Switzerland’s international commitments until 2024 and extend certain emissions reduction instruments which
would otherwise have expired.

_United States_

Regulation of GHGs in the United States is currently subject to complicated domestic and international political,
policy and economic dynamics, and the regulatory landscape is rapidly changing.

Current and prospective United States operations may result in emissions of GHGs and may be energy-intensive
and require the purchase of electricity, the generation of which often results in emissions of GHGs. The EPA has
determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health
and the environment. In response, the EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA regulating emissions of GHGs
from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants and industrial facilities. The EPA’s
regulations require such sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) prior to construction
or a major modification, as well as Title V operating permits. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits are required
to implement ‘best available control technology’, which can include carbon efficiency standards, GHG emission
concentration limits, specific technology requirements or other measures. In June 2019, the EPA implemented the
Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which provided for controls on emissions associated with power
generation. Since its publication, the ACE rule has been litigated and brought before the U.S. Supreme Court,
reversed the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision to vacate the ACE rule and remanded the case for further
proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court’s opinion issued on June 30, 2022. The EPA may in the future
issue a new proposed rule that would effectively replace the ACE rule. In August 2022, the U.S. Congress passed,
and President Biden signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which appropriates significant federal
funding for renewable energy initiatives and, for the first time ever, imposes a fee on methane emissions from
certain facilities. Future changes could re-introduce stricter requirements (such as those that previously existed
under the ‘Clean Power Plan’), which would increase our operating costs. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules
requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States on an annual
basis. We may be required to monitor GHG emissions from prospective United States operations in accordance
with the GHG emissions reporting rule and may also be required to ensure our monitoring activities are in
substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations. In addition, in March 2022, the SEC proposed new
rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related data risks and opportunities, including financial

132


-----

impacts, physical and transition risks, related governance and strategy and GHG emissions, for certain public
companies. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a significant number of U.S. states, including
Kansas, have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, including through the development of GHG
emission inventories and/or regional GHG gas cap-and-trade programs. It is difficult to predict the form for such
regulation that the U.S. Congress or U.S. states may adopt in the future (such as a cap-and-trade program,
technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate any costs that we
may be required to incur in respect of such requirements.

**_Regulation of Hazardous Incidents_**

_European Union_

With effect from June 1, 2015, operators of facilities storing hazardous goods in larger quantities are required to
comply with safety standards set forth in Directive 2012/18/EU on the control of major-accident hazards involving
dangerous substances (“Seveso III Directive”), successor of Council Directive 96/82/EC. The provisions are
designed to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances (such as emissions, fires and larger
explosions) and to limit detrimental consequences in the event of an accident. The degree of additional safety
requirements depends on the amounts of various classes of hazardous substances stored in the relevant facility.
For this purpose, the Seveso III Directive differentiates between ‘lower-tier establishments’ and ‘upper-tier
establishments’ where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or in excess of the quantities listed
in the Annex of the Seveso-III Directive.

According to the Seveso-III Directive, the operator is obliged to take all necessary measures to prevent major
accidents and to limit their consequences for human health and the environment. The operator has to send a
notification to the competent authority, including information such as the immediate environment of the
establishment, and factors likely to cause a major accident or to aggravate the consequences thereof including,
where available, details of neighboring establishments, of sites that fall outside the scope of this directive, areas
and developments that could be the source of or increase the risk or consequences of a major accident and of
domino effects.

The operator is required to document the establishment’s major-accident prevention policy (“MAPP”), ensure
that it is properly implemented, periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated, at least every five years.
The operator must also prepare an internal emergency plan and supply the competent authority with relevant
information to prepare an external emergency plan. For upper-tier establishments, the operator has to produce a
safety report for the purpose of demonstrating that a MAPP and an associated safety management system have
been implemented and ensure that all persons likely to be affected by a major accident receive regularly and in
the most appropriate form, without having to request it, clear and intelligible information on safety measures and
requisite behavior in the event of a major accident.

The EU member states have to ensure that appropriate safety distances between establishments covered by the
Seveso-III Directive and residential areas, buildings and areas of public use, recreational areas, and, as far as
possible, major transport routes are maintained. We may be subject to restrictions, for instance, in respect of site
locations of new plants and expansions to our existing plants.

At our sites and facilities, we frequently handle and use hazardous substances in the meaning of the national laws.
Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with the requirements, if insufficient
protection against spills or uncontrolled release of substances are identified in the future, we could incur capital
expenditures for technical improvements or maintenance to ensure future compliance.

At some of our sites, asbestos has been used in the construction of buildings. Currently, we are not aware of any
requirement under applicable environmental laws that requires the remediation of bound or encapsulated asbestos,
and we are not aware of any friable asbestos on the Group’s sites. If, however, a building is to be demolished or
refurbished, precautions may be necessary and the material must be properly disposed by licensed contractors.

_Germany_

The provisions of the Seveso III Directive were mainly implemented into German law through the Federal
Hazardous Incident Ordinance (Störfall-Verordnung) as well as, inter alia, the German Federal Emission Control
Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz) and the German Environmental Impact Assessment Act (Gesetz über die
_Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung)._

133

_Finland_

The Act on Safe Handling of Dangerous Chemicals and Explosives (Laki vaarallisten kemikaalien ja räjähteiden
_käsittelyn turvallisuudesta), the Government Decree on Supervision of Handling and Storage of Dangerous_
Chemicals (Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten kemikaalien käsittelyn ja varastoinnin valvonnasta) and the
Government Decree on Safety Obligations on Industrial Handling and Storage of Dangerous Chemicals
(Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten kemikaalien teollisen käsittelyn ja varastoinnin turvallisuusvaatimuksista)
contain provisions relating to on-site inspections by relevant agencies and the obligation to compile and regularly
update safety, rescue and evacuation plans.

_Switzerland_

The Ordinance on Hazardous Incidents (Verordnung über den Schutz vor Störfällen, Störfallverordnung) aims at
protecting populations and environments of damages resulting from hazardous incidents. Among other
requirements, production facilities which exceed certain thresholds provided under the Ordinance on Hazardous
Incidents must take appropriate measures to reduce the hazard potential, prevent accidents and limit their effects
and file a report with the competent authority indicating the quantity of hazardous substances stored in excess of
the relevant thresholds and the expected damage in the event of an incident.

_United States_

Prospective United States manufacturing facilities are or may be subject to the EPA’s Risk Management Program
(“RMP”) under the CAA, which requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute or store certain highly
hazardous chemicals to develop a risk management plan and program for accidental releases of such chemicals.
RMP also requires facilities to assess potential impacts to off-site populations in the event of a credible worstcase release and to document the policies, procedures, equipment and work practices in place to mitigate identified
risks. Similar risk management requirements are imposed upon our facilities under the Emergency Planning and
Community Right-to-Know Act “EPCRA”), which contains chemical emergency response planning, accident
release and other reporting and notification requirements which may be applicable to our prospective U.S.
manufacturing facility.

**_Production, Possession and Handling of Waste_**

_European Union_

Directive 2008/98/EC (“Waste Framework Directive”) provides for the legislative basis of a recycling society
in the EU. Its provisions on the collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste requires the EU member
states to take appropriate measures for prevention of waste in the first place and to ensure that waste is recovered
or disposed of without endangering human health or causing harm to the environment. Under the Waste
Framework Directive, the EU member states have to include permitting, registration and inspection requirements.

In 2018, the Waste Framework Directive was last revised, setting clear targets for reduction of waste and
establishing a long-term path for waste management and recycling. _Inter alia, minimum requirements were_
established for extended producer responsibility schemes to ensure that producers of products bear financial
responsibility for the management of the waste stage of a product’s life cycle.

In 2020, the European Commission presented a new circular economy strategy (the “Circular Economy Action
**Plan 2020”). It is supposed to be one of the main building blocks of the “European Green Deal”. The new plan**
focuses on the design and production for a circular economy, with the aim to ensure that the resources used are
kept in the EU economy for as long as possible. Under the new action plan, a number of proposals and measures
have been adopted. On January 25, 2022, the European Commission launched a call for evidence for an Impact
Assessment that will support the revision of the Waste Framework Directive. The European Commission’s
proposal for the revision of the Waste Framework Directive is expected to be published in Q2 2023. It aims to
improve the overall environmental outcome of waste management in line with the waste hierarchy and the
implementation of the polluter pays principle.

In most jurisdictions where we operate, we are subject to statutory provisions regarding waste management. These
provisions may govern permissible methods of, and responsibility for, the generation, handling, possession,
discharge and recycling of waste depending, among other things, on the dangers posed by the waste. In particular,
the discharge of waste is often restricted to licensed facilities. In many European jurisdictions, plants must use
licensed contractors for the disposal of hazardous or nonhazardous waste.

134


-----

_Germany_

Germany transposed the Waste Framework Directive into national law by the Act to Promote Circular Economy
and Safeguard the Environmentally Compatible Management of Waste (“Circular Economy Act”,
_Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz). Under the Circular Economy Act (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz), generators, owners,_
collectors and transporters of waste must demonstrate to the competent authority and to other parties that they
have properly disposed of hazardous waste (gefährliche Abfälle) by proof of waste disposal
(Entsorgungsnachweis). Documentation requirements include certain details regarding the handling, type, amount
and origin of hazardous waste.

_Finland_

In Finland the Waste Framework Directive has been implemented through the enactment of the Finnish Waste
Act (Jätelaki) and the Government Decree on Waste (Valtioneuvoston asetus jätteistä), which includes detailed
regulations for the handling, labelling and transportation of waste. The Finnish Waste Act was subject to an
extensive reform which entered into force in July 2021.

We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable waste management laws and continuously attempt
to reduce waste at our sites. Moreover, all of our sites comply with the requirements of ISO 14001 and the Ecomanagement and Audit Scheme.

_Switzerland_

The general principles on the disposal of waste are outlined in the Federal Environmental Protection Act
(Bundesgesetz über den Umweltschutz, Umweltschutzgesetz), the Waste Ordinance (Verordnung über die
_Vermeidung und die Entsorgung von Abfällen,_ _Abfallverordnung) and the Ordinance on Dealing with Waste_
(Verordnung über den Verkehr mit Abfällen). The provisions on the federal level partially delegate duties to the
cantons, and accordingly the respective cantonal laws on waste apply in addition. Hazardous waste
(Sonderabfälle) is generally subject to specific prevention and disposal requirements.

_United States_

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling,
transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of
solid waste. Under RCRA, persons may be liable at sites where the past or present storage, handling, treatment,
transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment
to health or the environment. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where disposal
occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the disposal occurred, and any persons who
disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property.
Liability under RCRA is strict and, under certain circumstances can be joint and several, so that any responsible
party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances.

**_Regulation on the Use of Water Resources_**

We are subject to several laws at the supranational and national levels relating to the use of ground and surface
water in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

_European Union_

Directive 2000/60/EC establishing a framework for European Community action in the field of water
policy(“Water Framework Directive”), requires EU member states to achieve a good qualitative and quantitative
status of all water bodies by 2015, a deadline that can be postponed to 2027 if various conditions in the legislation
are applied. Its main goals include expanding the scope of water protection to all waters, including surface waters
and groundwater, water management based on river basins, a ‘combined approach’ of emission limit values and
quality standards. The latest report from the European Commission to the European Parliament and the Council
on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, dated 15 December 2021, concludes that most member
states have made progress in identifying gaps and the measures required to achieve good status of water bodies.
However, the distance to be covered to full compliance with the Directive’s objectives is still considerable.

Groundwater is protected by both the Water Framework Directive and Directive 2006/118/EC (“Groundwater
**Directive”). The Groundwater Directive lays down detailed quality criteria for the assessment of the**
groundwater’s chemical status including standards set on EU level and requirements for threshold values to be set

135


-----

at the EU member state level. It contains criteria for the identification and reversal of pollution trends and requires
EU member states to establish measures to prevent the input of hazardous substances into the groundwater and
limit the introduction of other pollutants.

On October 26, 2022, the European Commission published a proposal amending the Water Framework Directive
and the Groundwater Directive, which has been in European Parliament’s committees since late January 2023.
The initiative updates the lists of priority substances for surface and groundwater and their associated legal
threshold values that are used to assess chemical status under the Water Framework Directive. It also addresses
monitoring and reporting of concentrations and measures.

The discharge of waste water and its treatment is regulated by EU Council Directive 91/271/EEC of May 21, 1991
(“Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive”).This Directive concerns the collection, treatment and discharge of
urban waste water and the treatment and discharge of waste water from certain industrial sectors. Its aim is to
protect the environment from any adverse effects caused by the discharge of such waters. The Urban Wastewater
Treatment Directive is currently under revision. The European Commission proposal dated October 26, 2022 aims
at better protecting the health of humans and the environment. More specifically, the revision aims at, inter alia,
making industry responsible for treating toxic micro pollutants that are released into the environment from the use
of their products (the “polluter pays” principle). To that end, the revised Directive will introduce extended
producer responsibility in order to have the industry pay for the treatment of the harmful pollutants that are
released from the use of their products. The proposal concentrates on especially harmful residues from the
pharmaceutical and cosmetics sector. Going forward, the European Commission will assess if other sectors can
be added to the extended producer responsibility scheme.

In most of the EU member states, the use of water requires a permit and is strictly regulated to avoid any
contamination of ground or surface water, such as through the disposal of sewage or waste water and the handling
of potentially dangerous materials. For example, the discharge of any pollutant substances into the surface water
may be subject to a permit whereas the discharge of any such substances into the ground water may generally be
impermissible.

Under the national law of some EU member states in which we operate, water permits may be granted for specific
periods of time, or may be reviewed after a certain period, and, therefore, must be renewed frequently. In certain
circumstances such water permits may be revoked without compensation. For these activities appropriate permits
to use and discharge water must be obtained and maintained during the operation of our plants and sites. We
currently hold all required water permits. However, such requirements, as well as the terms of the permits we
hold, may materially affect our operations by restricting the discharge of pollutant substances and waste water
exceeding certain temperatures and certain maximum levels, including storm-water run-offs, directly or indirectly
into public waters. We have been, and will continue to be, required to incur significant capital expenditures and
operating cost in order to maintain and upgrade our production sites and facilities to comply with applicable laws,
regulations and permits, and to obtain and maintain all necessary permits.

_Germany_

In Germany, the Water Framework Directive was transposed into national law via amendments to the Federal
Water Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz) and water legislation of the federal states, as well as the adoption of
ordinances at the level of the federal states. The Groundwater Directive was implemented by the German
Ordinance on Groundwater (Grundwasserverordnung), ensuring a uniform level of groundwater protection
throughout Germany.

_Finland_

In Finland, the protection of ground and surface water as well as regulation regarding the disposal of wastewater
is included in the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Ympäristönsuojelulaki) and the Govenrment Decree on
Substances that are Dangerous and Harmful for the Water Environment (Valtioneuvoston asetus vesiympäristölle
_vaarallisista ja haitallisista aineista). The Environmental Protection Act includes a prohibition to pollute and_
endanger the quality of ground water. The Finnish Water Act (Vesilaki) regulates the use of ground and surface
water, which generally requires permission by the competent authorities.

_Switzerland_

In Switzerland, the Federal Act on Water Protection (Bundesgesetz über den Schutz der Gewässer,
_Gewässerschutzgesetz) and the respective ordinance (Gewässerschutzverordnung) aims to protect ground and_
surface water from pollution and other harmful impact and hence, inter alia regulates the disposal of sewage or

136


-----

waste water and the handling of potentially dangerous materials and requires cantons to implement measures for
groundwater protection Furthermore, the use of public waters generally requires a permit or concession by the
competent authorities.

_United States_

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and subsequent amendments, commonly referred
to as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding
the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is
prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a CWA permit. The CWA also requires many facilities to
develop and maintain plans for preventing and responding to spills of hazardous substances, called Spill
Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans, and certain high volume hazardous substance handling/storage
facilities are required to prepare and maintain a more extensive plan called a Facility Response Plan. Violations
of the CWA can result in administrative, civil or criminal sanctions.

**_Regulation on Soil Contamination_**

Operation of a chemical manufacturing business involves the risk of environmental damage, such as soil and
groundwater contamination. In that respect, we are subject to national provisions that may impose obligations
related to remediation measures or compensation on us.

_European Union_

On the European level, liability for contamination of soil and groundwater has, to date, not been subject to specific
regulations or a protection policy. Some soil protection aspects can be found scattered in various legal documents,
hence different policies can contribute to protect soil. This is the case with many provisions in the existing
environmental legislation in areas such as water, waste, chemicals, industrial emissions, nature protection and
pesticides. However, these provisions do not establish a comprehensive soil protection regime including liability
for soil and groundwater contamination.

On November 17, 2021, the EU Commission adopted a new EU Soil Strategy for 2030. It provides the framework
and concrete steps towards protecting and restoring soils, and ensuring that they are used sustainably. As part of
this, a new Soil Health Law has been announced to protect and restore soils and ensure that they are used
sustainably. The proposed legislation aims to help achieve healthy soils by 2050, with concrete actions by 2030.
It will do so by identifying the key soil threats in the EU, such as erosion, floods and landslides, loss of soil organic
matter, salinization, contamination, compaction, sealing, as well as loss of soil biodiversity. The European
Commission’s adoption is planned for Q2 2023.

_Germany_

Under the German Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz) and several regulations promulgated
thereunder, owners of land and operators of facilities are required to prevent any contamination of the soil by
taking necessary precautions. If any soil contamination (schädliche Bodenveränderung) has occurred, or where
pollution was caused in the past (Altlasten, “past-pollution”), owners of land, operators of facilities, the party
having caused the pollution or its universal successor (Gesamtrechtsnachfolger) and the previous owner if such
owner transferred title to the real property after March 1, 1999 and knew, or should have known, of the
contamination or past pollution, may be held responsible for investigation and remediation measures and cost
thereof. In certain cases, a party may even be held liable for the entire cost of remediation, irrespective of its fault,
the lawfulness of disposal or the actions of other parties. Non-compliance with the obligations under the applicable
laws and regulations may result in administrative fines or, in certain cases, criminal liability.

_Finland_

Under the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Ympäristönsuojelulaki), the polluter is primarily responsible for
remedying pollution to groundwater or soil. However, if the polluter cannot be determined or found or is unable
or neglects to carry out its clean-up obligations, the current possessor (i.e., tenant or owner) of the contaminated
site can be held liable for reasonable remedial measures if the possessor knew, or should have known, about the
contamination at the time the site was acquired, or if the owner consented to the polluting activity. The Finnish
Environmental Protection Act applies only to pollution that has occurred on or after January 1, 1994. For
contamination that occurred before this date, liability is based on the then applicable Waste Act (Jätelaki) and
Waste Management Act (Jätehuoltolaki) and, in certain cases, also the Water Act and the Health Care Act
(Terveydenhoitolaki).

137


-----

_Switzerland_

The Federal Environmental Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Umweltschutz, Umweltschutzgesetz) and
implementing legislation requires owners of land and operators of facilities to prevent soil contamination by taking
necessary precautions. According to the Ordinance on the Remediation of Polluted Sites (Verordnung über die
_Sanierung von belasteten Standorten, Altlasten-Verordnung), sites which have, or which are expected to have, a_
harmful and adverse impact on soil, must be registered in a special cadaster and adhere to certain examination,
monitoring and remediation measures. This is particularly relevant if the owner or operator intends to modify its
facilities, which is generally permitted only if such modification would not lead to the requirement of remediation.
If a facility does require remediation, such modification is only permitted if it is undertaken in connection with
the facility’s remediation.

_United States_

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar
state laws, certain persons may be liable at sites where or from a release of hazardous substances has occurred or
is threatened. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened
release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons
who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated
property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, retroactive and joint and several, so that any responsible party may
be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release or threatened release of hazardous
substances, as well as any subsequent monitoring.

**_Environmental Damage_**

_European Union_

We are subject to Directive 2004/35/EC on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying
of environmental damage (“ELD”), as implemented into member state law.

_Germany_

The German Environmental Damage Act (Umweltschadensgesetz) provides for an obligation to prevent damage
to the environment and to remedy such damage regardless of fault. CABB’s obligations under it reach beyond the
rule of German civil liability for ground water and soil contamination and cover environmental losses that may
not be eligible for compensation under other laws. The obligations and liabilities under the German Environmental
Damage Act constitute public law obligations to avoid or remedy environmental damage. In addition, nongovernmental environmental organizations may institute legal proceedings in the event the relevant authority has
failed to take the necessary steps for enforcement.

_Finland_

The Finnish Act on Compensation for Environmental Damage (Laki ympäristövahinkojen korvaamisesta)
establishes a compensatory damages regime for personal injuries, damage to property and in certain cases for
financial losses sustained from pollution of water, air or soil as well as from noise, vibrations, radiation, light,
heat, odor or from other similar nuisances. Furthermore, the act regulates compensation for clean-up costs as well
as preventive and remediation measures. The person whose activity has caused the environmental damage, a
person comparable to the person carrying out the activity causing the environmental damage, or the person to
whom the activity which caused the environmental damage has been assigned, if the assignee knew or should
have known, at the time of assignment, about the loss or the nuisance or the threat of the same, is liable to
compensate for the damage. Furthermore, our Finnish companies are required to carry insurance to comply with
the Finnish Environmental Damage Insurance Act (Laki ympäristövahinkovakuutuksesta) which establishes a
complementary compensation scheme if the party liable for the environmental damage is insolvent or cannot be
identified.

_Switzerland_

Under the Federal Environmental Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Umweltschutz, Umweltschutzgesetz) the
operator of an establishment or installation posing a particular risk to the environment is liable for any damage
resulting from harmful impact as a result of the realization of that risk regardless of fault, unless loss or damage
was caused by force majeure or by gross negligence on the part of the injured party or a third party.

**_Handling and Transportation of Hazardous Goods_**

We are involved in the carriage of hazardous goods as, e.g., loader and unloader of such goods and are subject to
specific requirements related to such carriage. At the international level, the European Agreement concerning the
International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road as of September 30, 1957 (Accord européen relatif au
_transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route, “ADR”), as last amended on January 1, 2023,_
includes provisions applicable to the carriage of dangerous goods on roads. Pursuant to the ADR, dangerous
goods, as a general rule, may be carried internationally in road vehicles subject to compliance with a number of
conditions, such as packaging and labeling requirements. Specific dangerous goods (e.g., goods which are
poisonous and explosive at the same time) are excluded from carriage on the road. The ADR has been
implemented and supplemented by many countries in which we operate.

_European Union_

Directive 2008/68/EC of September 24, 2008 on the inland transport of dangerous goods establishes a common
regime for all aspects of the inland transport of dangerous goods, by road, rail and inland waterways within the
European Union and incorporates the ADR into European law.

_Germany_

In Germany the ADR is implemented by the Ordinance on Hazardous Goods for Road, Rail and Inland Shipping
(Gefahrgutverordnung Straße, Eisenbahn und Binnenschifffahrt), an ordinance passed under the Hazardous
Goods Act (Gefahrgutbeförderungsgesetz).

_Finland_

In Finland, the transportation of hazardous goods is regulated by the Act on the Transport of Dangerous Goods
(Laki vaarallisten aineiden kuljetuksesta) and the Government Decree on the Transport of Dangerous Goods by
Road (Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten aineiden kuljetuksesta tiellä).

_Switzerland_

In Switzerland, the ADR is implemented through the Ordinance on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods on
the Road (Verordnung über die Beförderung gefährlicher Güter auf der Strasse) and the Ordinance regarding
Persons Responsible for the Transportation of Hazardous Goods on Roads, Rail and Bodies of Water
(Gefahrgutbeauftragtenverordnung).

**Health and Safety**

We must comply with applicable laws and regulations to protect employees against occupational injuries in all
jurisdictions in which we operate. Under such laws and regulations, employers typically must establish the
conditions and the flow of work in a manner that effectively prevents dangers to employees. In particular,
employers must observe certain medical and hygienic standards and comply with certain occupational health and
safety requirements, such as permissible maximum levels for noise at the work place, the use of personal protective
equipment and requirements relating to maximum temperatures and air ventilation.

_European Union_

The applicable occupational health and safety regulatory regime in the European Union includes a number of
Directives which require employers to provide for their employees' safety. In particular, there is Council Directive
89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at
work and Council Directive 91/383/EEC supplementing the measures to encourage improvements in the safety
and health at work of workers with a fixed-duration employment relationship or a temporary employment
relationship.

_Germany_

In Germany, these Directives were transposed into German law by the German Act on Occupational Protection
(Arbeitsschutzgesetz) and the German Act on Occupational Safety (Arbeitssicherheitsgesetz), which require
employers to provide for their employee's safety. These general obligations are substantiated in several ordinances
under the respective laws, which are further detailed in technical guidelines. The applicable occupational safety
regulatory regime also includes the German Ordinance on Occupational Safety (Betriebssicherheitsverordnung),

139


-----

the German Ordinance on Requirements for Workplaces (Arbeitsstättenverordnung) and a number of technical
guidelines enacted under these ordinances. In general, compliance with employment safety regulations is subject
to regulatory supervision.

_Finland_

The Occupational Safety and Health Act (Työturvallisuuslaki) states that employers have a duty to take care of
the safety and health of their employees while at work by taking the necessary measures.

_Switzerland_

The Federal Employment Act (Bundesgesetz über die Arbeit in Industrie, Gewerbe und Handel, Arbeitsgesetz)
states that employers are responsible for taking appropriate measures to protect their employees’ health. Ordinance
3 to the Employment Act regarding Health Protection (Gesundheitsschutz) specifies the detailed duties, for
instance regarding the construction of the buildings which are used by the employees, hygienic conditions,
protective equipment and working clothes.

_United States_

Any current and future United States operations are, or will be, subject to OSHA and comparable state laws that
regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication
standard, EPCRA and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information
be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided
to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

Of particular relevance to any prospective United States manufacturing operations, OSHA’s standard on Process
Safety Management (“PSM”) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals contains requirements for the management of
hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous chemicals. OSHA’s PSM regulations are designed to
prevent or minimize the consequences of unexpected releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive liquids
and gases in chemical processes. PSM covers facilities that deal with any of certain listed toxic and reactive
chemicals and flammable liquids and gases in amounts over specified threshold quantities. PSM requires process
hazard analysis, a systematic study of events that could cause hazardous substance releases and the safeguards to
prevent them. Employers must perform an initial hazard analysis on all processes covered by the standard and
update the analysis at least every five years. Among other things, PSM also mandates written operating
procedures, employee training, pre-startup safety reviews, evaluation of mechanical integrity of equipment,
written procedures for managing change, investigation of incidents involving releases or near misses of covered
chemicals, emergency action plans and compliance audits.

**Other Regulations**

_Germany_

**_Renewable Energy Sources Act in Germany_**

The German Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energiengesetz, "EEG") is a series of German laws
that originally provided a feed-in tariff scheme to encourage the generation of electricity from renewable sources.
The EEG 2014 specified the transition to an auction system for most technologies which has been finished with
the EEG 2017. The remuneration for the generation of renewable energy was balanced by a levy that was imposed
on the consumers of energy (“EEG-levy”) until 2022. As of 1 July 2022, the EEG-levy was discontinued due to
high energy prices, and it was abolished as of January 2023. Until then, our German sites benefitted from
exemptions from the EEG-levy as we qualify as an energy intensive industry under the EEG.

**_Individual Network Tariffs_**

Under the Electricity Network Tariff Regulation Ordinance (Stromnetzentgeltverordnung, “StromNEV”), each
grid user is charged a network tariff by the network operator as a consideration for network usage. Undertakings
with high electricity consumption may benefit from individually agreed network tariffs (ranging between 10%
and 20% of the regular network tariff) provided that these undertakings meet the relevant consumption related
thresholds under the StromNEV.

Our German sites currently benefit each from an arrangement on individual network tariffs with the responsible
network operator. If the consumption related thresholds are not met by the relevant site in a calendar year, the

140


-----

difference to the regular network tariff must be paid to the network operator for such calendar year retroactively.
Therefore, it remains uncertain whether we may have to pay the difference to the full network tariff retroactively
or whether the eligibility criteria may be amended in the future, which could result in a partial loss of the individual
network tariffs. This would lead to additional expenses which would adversely affect our business, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_German Energy Tax Act and German Electricity Tax Act_**

As of 2013, tax refunds under the German Energy Tax Act (Energiesteuergesetz) and the Electricity Act
(Stromsteuergesetz) depend on the proof of the implementation of an Energy Management System according to
ISO 50001 or the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme. All our German sites fulfill either or both of these
prerequisites.

_Supranational Law_

**_Chemical Weapons Convention_**

While we use chemicals solely for the production of crop and life sciences products and do not manufacture
chemical or other weapons, our business requires the handling of substances that are regulated by the Chemical
Weapons Convention (“CWC”) and relevant national implementing legislation. The CWC is a treaty requiring
its signatories to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons and entered into force on April 29, 1997 in the
first 65 signatory states. Moreover, it restricts trade in certain chemical substances that currently are or may be
used to manufacture chemical weapons. Germany and Switzerland, the United States, Luxembourg and Finland
have implemented the obligations under CWC into national law. Under the respective regulations, the
manufacturing, trade or transport of certain chemical substances is subject to restrictions, including with respect
to licensing, monitoring, and verification requirements, and in certain jurisdictions the manufacturing, trade or
transport of certain chemical substances is prohibited.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

**New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and structure_**

On April 20, 2023, CABB Group (as an original borrower and an original guarantor), the Issuer (as company and
an original guarantor), Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft and Bank of America Europe Designated Activity Company (as arrangers), GLAS USA LLC
(as facility agent) and GLAS Trust Corporation Limited (as security agent) (amongst others) entered into the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement.

The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement provides for borrowings of up to €110 million on a committed
basis. The New Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement in euro, Swiss francs, U.S. dollars or certain other currencies (if agreed)
by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of Letters of Credit (the “Letters of Credit”) (upon the appointment
of an Issuing Bank) and by way of any Ancillary Facilities that may be made available thereunder (each as defined
in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement). Subject to certain exceptions, loans may be borrowed, repaid
and re-borrowed at any time. Borrowings will be available to be used for, amongst other things, general corporate
and working capital purposes of the Group (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement)
including, without limitation, for payment of interest under the Notes (but not the repayment, prepayment,
acquisition and/or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes or the Existing Notes).

In addition, the Issuer may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as additional tranches or
increase of an existing facility (including any previously incurred additional facility) under the New Revolving
Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Additional Facility Commitments”) in amounts up to the Credit Facilities
Basket (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) or, to the extent it is exceeded, would
otherwise constitute Permitted Debt (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement). The Issuer
and the relevant lenders may agree to certain terms in relation to the Additional Facility Commitments, including
the margin, commitment fee, the maturity date and the availability period (each subject to parameters as set out in
the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement). There are certain limitations (in addition to the maximum
amount) on the ability to incur Additional Facility Commitments.

**_Availability_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, be utilized
from (and including) the Closing Date (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) until (and
including) the date falling one month prior to the maturity date of the New Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Borrowers and Guarantors_**

Under the New Revolving Credit Facility, CABB Group is the original borrower and an original guarantor and
the Issuer is an original guarantor. A mechanism is included in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement to
enable certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to accede as additional borrowers or additional guarantors under the
New Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain conditions. The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
also requires that, subject to, for the avoidance of doubt, the section entitled “Guarantees” below, in the future
each member of the Group (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) which is or becomes a
Material Company (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement), any wholly-owned member
of the Group incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction of which such Material Company is the direct wholly-owned
Subsidiary, and each member of the Group which is otherwise required to become a guarantor in order to satisfy
the Guarantor Coverage Test (as defined below), becomes an additional guarantor under the New Revolving
Credit Facilities Agreement and, where applicable, shall grant security over certain of its material assets in favor
of the Security Agent (subject to agreed security principles included in the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement (the “Agreed Security Principles”)).

**_Maturity and Repayment Requirements_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility matures on the date falling 54 months after the Closing Date (as defined in
the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement). Each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against amounts to be drawn on such date. All outstanding
amounts under the New Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on or prior to the maturity date for the
New Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the New Revolving Credit

146


-----

Facility may be re-borrowed during the relevant availability period, subject to certain conditions. The maturity
date for a facility under an Additional Facility Commitment is the date agreed between the relevant borrower and
the relevant lenders.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR
(in respect of loans denominated in euro), compounded SARON (in respect of loans denominated in Swiss francs)
or term SOFR (in respect of loans denominated in U.S. dollars), plus, in each case, an initial margin of 3.50% per
_annum. The applicable margin in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility shall be calculated in accordance_
with a margin ratchet (subject to customary conditions).

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the New Revolving
Credit Facility at the rate of 30% of the then applicable margin. The commitment fee will be payable quarterly in
arrears on (i) either (at the Issuer’s sole and absolute discretion) the last day of each successive period of three
Months which ends during the availability period or each quarter date occurring during the availability period
(subject to certain notification requirements); (ii) the last day of the availability period of the New Revolving
Credit Facility; and (iii) if cancelled, on the cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s commitment under the New
Revolving Credit Facility at the time such cancellation is effective. No commitment fee shall be payable unless
the Closing Date (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) occurs. The Issuer and the
relevant lenders may agree a commitment fee in connection with an Additional Facility Commitments.

Default interest on overdue amounts is calculated at a rate which is 1% per annum higher than the rate applicable
to the loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

The Issuer is also required to pay customary agency fees to the facility agent and the Security Agent in connection
with the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement. No such agency fees shall be payable unless the Closing
Date (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) occurs.

**_Guarantees_**

The Issuer and CABB Group will provide a senior guarantee of all amounts payable to each Finance Party (as
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) by them or any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries which
accede to the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement as additional borrowers or additional guarantors.

The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement requires that (subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain
other exceptions and any applicable guarantee limitations arising under laws applicable to the relevant guarantors)
each subsidiary of the Issuer that is or becomes a Material Company (which definition includes, among other
things, any wholly-owned member of the Group (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement)
incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction (as defined below) and that has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization representing more than 5% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the New Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement), subject to certain exceptions)) and any wholly-owned member of the Group incorporated
in a Guarantor Jurisdiction of which such Material Company is the direct wholly-owned Subsidiary, will be
required to become an additional guarantor under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement within 180 days
of the last date (including any applicable extension or grace period) (or such later date as the facility agent may
agree) on which the applicable annual financial statements for the relevant fiscal year demonstrating that such
subsidiary is a Material Company were required to be delivered.

Furthermore, if on the last day of a fiscal year of the Issuer, the aggregate EBITDA of the guarantors under the
New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement represents less than 80% of the aggregate EBITDA of wholly-owned
members of the Group (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) incorporated in a Guarantor
Jurisdiction (as defined below) (on a consolidated basis and excluding the EBITDA of any on-balance sheet joint
ventures and any member of the Group (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) that is not
required to or cannot become a guarantor due to legal prohibitions or the Agreed Security Principles) (subject to
certain exceptions) (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”) the Issuer must, within 180 days of the last date (including
any applicable extension or grace period) (or such later date as the facility agent may agree) on which the
applicable annual financial statements for the relevant year were required to be delivered, cause sufficient
members of the Group (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) to accede to the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement as additional guarantors (subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain
other exceptions and any applicable guarantee limitations arising under laws applicable to the relevant guarantors)

147


-----

to satisfy the Guarantor Coverage Test (to be calculated as if such additional guarantors had been guarantors on
such last day of the relevant fiscal year).

“Guarantor Jurisdiction” means Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and any state within the United
States and the District of Columbia, (provided that if a borrower under the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement is incorporated in a jurisdiction which is not a Guarantor Jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of that borrower
shall become a Guarantor Jurisdiction for the purposes of the Agreed Security Principles, but only for so long as
any borrower is incorporated in such jurisdiction).

**_Security_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) secured on a _pari passu_
basis by the same collateral that secures the Notes as further described in the section entitled “Description of the
_Notes—Security.”_

Subject to any legal prohibitions and the Agreed Security Principles, the following transaction security shall be
granted as a condition precedent to the availability of the New Revolving Credit Facility: (i) the Issuer shall grant
a German law governed share pledge over its shares in CABB Group GmbH; (ii) the Issuer shall grant a
Luxembourg law governed security agreement over any material structural intercompany loan receivables owed
to it by any member of the Group; (iii) CABB Group GmbH shall grant a German law governed security agreement
over any material structural intercompany loan receivables owed to it by any member of the Group; and (iv) the
Issuer shall grant a Luxembourg law governed security agreement over any material bank accounts of the Issuer
located in Luxembourg.

Any borrower or guarantor under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement will (as required by, and on
terms consistent with, the Agreed Security Principles) grant security in favour of the Security Agent over (i) the
shares it directly owns in any borrower or Material Company; and (ii) material structural intra-Group loan
receivables owed to such borrower or guarantor, to the extent it is a borrower or Material Company (but not
otherwise). In addition, a US borrower or guarantor will, subject to the customary exceptions and the Agreed
Security Principles grant all-assets security by way of a security agreement governed by the laws of the State of
New York (subject to customary exclusions, which shall include, without limitation, real estate and intellectual
property) and other customary qualifications.

No other security is required to be granted.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties,
subject to certain customary materiality, actual knowledge and other qualifications, exceptions and baskets,
including, without limitation: (i) status and incorporation; (ii) binding obligations; (iii) non-conflict with

determination to Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent four fiscal quarters ending prior to the
date of such determination, each such term as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) equal

offering as if the proceeds of that public offering that have or will be applied in prepayment of the New Revolving
Credit Facility have been applied in prepayment of the New Revolving Credit Facility on the last day of that
Relevant Period (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement)) or (ii) an achievement by the
Issuer (or any of its affiliates) of a long-term corporate credit rating of Baa3/BBB- or better by Moody’s Investor
Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings Ltd.

**_Mandatory Prepayment Requirements upon a Change of Control_**

On a Change of Control (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement), the Issuer shall promptly
notify the facility agent (such notice being the “Change of Control Notice”) who shall promptly notify the lenders
under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and any issuing bank accordingly.

At the Issuer’s option (as specified in the Change of Control Notice), unless otherwise agreed between the Issuer
and the Majority Lenders under (and as defined in) the New Revolving Credit Facility either: (A) each lender shall
be entitled to cancel its commitments and require repayment of all its share of utilizations and payment of all
amounts owing to it under the Finance Documents (as defined under the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement) and each issuing bank shall be entitled to require than any letters of credit issued by it are prepaid and
cancelled, in each case by notification to the facility agent within 15 business days of the Change of Control
Notice, whereupon, (i) the undrawn commitments of such lender shall, by no less than 5 business days’ prior
notice to the Issuer, be cancelled and such lender shall have no obligation to fund or participate in any new
utilization ((including in any new ancillary facility or fronted ancillary facility) (other than a letter of credit issued
or to be issued pursuant to a renewal request or a utilization of an ancillary facility or a fronted ancillary facility
to refinance any amount falling due under an ancillary facility or a fronted ancillary facility) and, in the case of
an issuing bank, such issuing bank shall have no obligation to issue any letter of credit (other than a letter of credit
issued or to be issued pursuant to a renewal request); and (ii) on the date falling no later than 60 days after the
Change of Control Notice, all outstanding utilizations (including ancillary outstandings) together with accrued
interest, and all other amounts accrued or owing to such lender (or issuing bank, as the case may be) shall become
immediately due and payable and the relevant borrower will immediately prepay all utilizations and amounts
provided by or owing to that lender and procure that any cash collateral provided by that lender is released and
any ancillary facility, fronted ancillary facility and letter of credit is prepaid and cancelled; or (B) all outstanding
undrawn commitments of each lender shall be immediately cancelled and all outstanding utilizations and ancillary
outstandings shall become immediately due and payable, together with accrued interest and other amounts accrued

149


-----

to each lender (or that lender in its capacity as issuing bank) under the Finance Documents (as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement).

**_Draw Stop_**

If, on any quarter date in respect of the period of the most recent four consecutive financial quarters (commencing
with the quarter date ending at the end of the first full financial quarter after the Closing Date) the aggregate
amount outstanding of all loan utilizations under the New Revolving Credit Facility (or any other facility that has
the benefit of the draw stop threshold) (the “Springing Test Condition”) exceeds an amount equal to 40 per cent.
of the total commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement (or any other facility that has the
benefit of the draw stop threshold), the Issuer is required to confirm whether or not the Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio (defined as the ratio of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Indebtedness on the date of such
determination to Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent four fiscal quarters ending prior to the
date of such determination, each such term as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) on such
quarter date for the period of last twelve months ending on that quarter date (subject to certain provisions and
adjustments) exceeds 7.40:1 (the “Draw Stop Threshold”).

If (to the extent required to be tested) the Draw Stop Threshold has been exceeded on the most recent quarter date
for which a compliance certificate has been delivered (as evidenced in such compliance certificate), the borrowers
shall, subject to a grace period and certain cure and prevention rights available to the Issuer under the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, be restricted from utilizing the New Revolving Credit Facility (or any
other facility that has the benefit of the draw stop threshold). For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any
other term of the Finance Documents, the Draw Stop Threshold being exceeded shall not (and shall not be deemed
to) directly or indirectly constitute, or result in, a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other
term in the Finance Documents or a default or an event of default.

The Issuer is permitted to prevent or cure excesses of the Draw Stop Threshold as described above by applying
any cure amount (being amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted
subordinated debt) towards increasing the amount of Consolidated EBITDA (an “EBITDA Cure”) or towards
decreasing Consolidated Senior Secured Net Indebtedness (a “Net Debt Cure”) (each as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement). There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the
New Revolving Credit Facility. No more than four EBITDA Cures may be taken into account during the term of
the New Revolving Credit Facility with no more than two EBITDA Cures in any three successive testing periods,
and there is no limit on the number of Net Debt Cures that may be taken into account during the term of the New
Revolving Credit Facility.

The Issuer is also permitted to prevent or cure excesses of the Draw Stop Threshold as described above by
recalculating the Springing Test Condition or Draw Stop Threshold for any period at any time based upon
sufficient available information (including the latest internally available financial information for an LTM period)
and, if the Springing Test Condition is not met or the Draw Stop Threshold is complied with at such time (due to
prepayments of the New Revolving Credit Facility, cash or cash equivalents on balance sheet or otherwise), the
Draw Stop Threshold shall be deemed complied with and any prior breach of such Draw Stop Threshold shall be
deemed cured and shall not (and shall not be deemed to) directly or indirectly entitle any lender to refuse to
participate in any utilisation or any issuing bank to refuse to issue any letter of credit. For any such calculation,
the Issuer may give _pro forma effect to certain transactions (and any permitted adjustments to Consolidated_
EBITDA, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Indebtedness, the Draw Stop Threshold or the Springing Test
Condition in connection therewith) for which the applicable calculation date has occurred following the end of
the period for which such calculation is made as if such transaction had been consummated on the first day of
such period.

**_Events of Default_**

The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement contains substantially the same events of default, with certain
adjustments, as those applicable to the Notes as set forth in the section entitled “— Events of Default.” In addition,
the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement contains the following events of default (subject to customary
materiality qualifiers, remedy periods and certain excluded matters):

    - inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made;

    - breach of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

150


-----

    - unlawfulness, repudiation, rescission, invalidity or unenforceability of the Finance Documents (as
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) entered into in connection with the New
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Governing Law and Jurisdiction_**

The New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it are governed by English law, and disputes are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of England
in London.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Trustee, the agent, arrangers and lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
and the Security Agent will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions
of, the Intercreditor Agreement and shall be deemed to have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor
Agreement on its behalf.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the relationship
of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the Guarantors and any
other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider (as
defined below), when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers,
when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will
be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and provisions related
to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions, among others, to be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the proposed Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that
document because it, and not the description that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of
the Trustees. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

For the purposes of this description:

“Senior Secured Group” shall mean the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

References to the “Senior Secured Notes” shall include the Notes and any other notes, securities or other debt
instruments which are designated by the Issuer as Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement and
references to the “Topco Notes” shall include any notes, securities or other debt instruments which are designated
by the Issuer as Topco Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement uses the term “the Company” to refer to the Issuer and “Senior Secured Notes
**Liabilities” to refer to the Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer. It uses the term “Topco” to refer to**
Holdco and any person that becomes a direct shareholder of the Issuer and which has acceded to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a Topco, and “Topco Notes Liabilities” to refer to any liabilities due, owing or incurred by the
Debtors in connection with the Topco Notes.

(B) all amounts received by any Topco Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or
assurance are immediately paid to the Security Agent for application as set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below; and_

(iii) any security, guarantee indemnity or other assurance:

(A) from any person that is not a member of the Topco Group; and

(B) from any member of the Topco Group:

(1) in connection with any escrow or similar arrangements relating to amounts held by a
person which is not a member of the Topco Group prior to release of those amounts to
a member of the Topco Group;

(2) in connection with any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment,
repayment, purchase or other discharge of any Secured Liabilities not prohibited by the
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(3) as otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

No security (other than pursuant to the secured documents relating to Topco Independent Transaction Security or
Topco Shared Security or as described above) shall be granted by a member of the Senior Secured Group in
respect of any Topco Liabilities.

_New Debt Financing_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing, additional,
supplemental or new financing arrangements or the assumption or incurrence of any Liabilities that will constitute,
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash
Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities or Pari Passu
Hedging Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by the Issuer that such
New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented without limitation by way of refinancing, replacement,
exchange, set-off, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional or supplemental financing
arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt
Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each other person
party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized
and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security
document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as
the case may be) and/or to effect the ranking, priority guarantees and security of the New Debt Financing, subject
to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be, unless otherwise required
by the Issuer, substantially the same (if applicable) as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who, after
the Closing Date (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement), becomes a Restricted Subsidiary
or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of or
shares (or other ownership interests) in any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (as
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any
security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is
subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor

156


-----

Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing)
shall be permitted to continue or subsist and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity
or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity
or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any
liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a
contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset
required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of
such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or
would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any
Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

_Permitted Payments_

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities, the Pari Passu Cash Management Facility Liabilities
(together with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors in respect thereof
being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration events under the
New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior
Secured Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events
in relation to a member of the Senior Secured Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party
Security Providers and received by Senior Secured Creditors in accordance with the provisions described below
under _“—Application of Proceeds” provided that there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments_
received, other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an event of
default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the date which is the later of the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities have been discharged (the “Senior Discharge Date”) and the date on which all of the Super
Senior Liabilities have been discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), the Issuer, the members of the
Senior Secured Group and Third Party Security Providers may only make specified scheduled payments in respect
of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities,
subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest) is not
prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement,
any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement
and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained
to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities
and no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or
certain fees) is continuing under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Cash Management Facility
Document, any Super Senior Cash Management Facility Document or Senior Secured Notes Document (each as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

Certain of the features set out below with respect to payments in respect of Topco Liabilities apply to payments
in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital
structure, and the payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities
in (ii) of the next paragraph.

157

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Discharge Date, the Super Senior Discharge Date and the first
date (the “Second Lien Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the
“Priority Discharge Date”), the Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other members of
the Senior Secured Group may only make specified scheduled payments (including any other direct or indirect
step, matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor
Agreement) under the Topco Liabilities or in respect of any liabilities under any Topco Proceeds Loan (together
the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors or any Topco Borrower or any holding company of the
Issuer or other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities
only) (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Topco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal
or interest) has occurred and is continuing under the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Super Senior

Cash Management Document or any Senior Secured Notes Document (a “Senior Secured
**Payment Default”), or under the Second Lien Facilities or the Second Lien Notes (a “Second**
**Lien Payment Default”); and**

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit
such payment have been obtained, (2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or
capitalized interest (such other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if
applicable, special interest (or liquidated damages)), is outstanding and default interest on the

payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to Topco Liabilities and amounts in

Senior Creditors and Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts
due under any syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other
than in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment
Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower under any
prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (L) below) irrespective of
whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the payment is not
prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any
equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt
Documents): (A) of amounts due in respect of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the
Topco Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for
restructuring advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial

the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual
of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or any such amount
described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be made if an event of default has occurred
under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such
payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien
Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, made in connection with all or part of the
Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares
in any holding company of the Issuer (“Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that (x) no cash or cash
equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, (y) it does not result in a Change of
Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and (z) any
Liabilities owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured
Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result
of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien
Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien
Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities or

terms as the Topco Liabilities, (J) of audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and incidental
expenses required to maintain existence or any other reasonable and administrative and maintenance
costs and expenses of a Topco Borrower or its affiliates, (K) funded directly or indirectly with the
proceeds of Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (L) by the
Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents; and such payment is
not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or such payment is funded
from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group without breaching the
terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if the payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and
made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality
or replacement of lenders and (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default
has occurred and is continuing, of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final
maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that
contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or
borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security Providers
may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance Documents
and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the occurrence
of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of
default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the
instructions of the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors or Second Lien Creditors that gave
the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) issues a notice (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to
the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco
**Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing**
and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iii) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has been
remedied or waived;

(iv) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

159


-----

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the requisite Senior
Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant
Topco Payment Stop Notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent
and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the relevant Topco Payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of
Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of default.
No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a Topco
Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default
shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event
of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement
**Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.**

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to make
any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt Documents
even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of interest (if
any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment
stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
**Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments**
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the latest to
occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the
first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the
latest to occur of each such discharge date being the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior
Secured Creditor) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors
under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
_Application of Proceeds”;_

160


-----

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other
litigation or a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider
(other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance
with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor or any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which
is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor or member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will (except, with respect to Intra-Group Liabilities, in the case of a Creditor that is an Intra-Group
Lender, if and to the extent compliance with such provisions would expose the directors of that Intra-Group Lender
to the risk of becoming personally liable pursuant to Section 43 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act
(GmbHG) or, in relation to an Intra-Group Lender not incorporated in Germany, pursuant to similar rules under
applicable law):

(A) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (1) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and
promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (2) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to
the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to the Final
Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a
Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any
proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received
or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application
_of Proceeds.”_

_Effect of Insolvency Event_

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to an Obligor (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement), Material Company or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making of
an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization (excluding solvent
reorganizations), (b) a composition, compromise, assignment, or arrangement with any class of creditors generally
(other than any Secured Party) in connection with or as a result of any financial difficulty on the part of that
Obligor, Material Company or Third Party Security Provider; (c) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its
indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory
manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step is taken
in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings which, if capable of remedy, are

161


-----

discharged, stayed or dismissed within 20 business days of commencement (or, if earlier, the date on which it is
advertised), proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful
or as permitted under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or any Permitted Second Lien Facility
Agreement or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of that Obligor, Material Company or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct
the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing
to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence
of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the
liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of
any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the
realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights, each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take
Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take
other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, a
Material Company or a Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent
reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

_Security Enforcement Regime_

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the Transaction
Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group,
Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as specified in the
provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, Senior Secured
Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than fifty (50)% of the Senior
Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”),
and Super Senior Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the Super Senior Secured Liabilities
(the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall
mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement
regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but before the
Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the Second Lien
Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than fifty (50)% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”),

provided that, in each case, the Super Senior Credit Participations, the Senior Secured Credit Participations, the
Second Lien Credit Participations and the Topco Credit Participations of a Sponsor Affiliate (each as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) (as applicable) shall, for the purposes of this definition, be deemed to be zero.

162


-----

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in accordance
with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable, in accordance
with its terms, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue
enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the
Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not either made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions
they reasonably believe to be consistent with the Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance
the prospects of achieving the Enforcement Objective (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) before the
Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior
Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super
Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to (A)
enforce or cease enforcing or (B) require any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have
arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable)
have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to (A) enforce or cease enforcing or (B)
require any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, an agent or trustee under the
Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors) where the rights of the
Topco Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding
paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then
entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give such instruction and do not indicate any intention to
give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent
that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph above may give
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall
act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that to the
extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, (i) the method of enforcement chosen should
maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and (iii)
enforcement in relation to assets over EUR 5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or
other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is so requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors
or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of
accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any
of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco Independent

163


-----

Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under the above
provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may
include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the Transaction
Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security Documents except
through the Security Agent.

The Secured Parties grant (and undertake to grant in favour of the Security Agent at its request, by means of a
notarized power of attorney (and apostilled) if necessary), as many powers as the Security Agent may require in
order to take all necessary action in order to enforce any of the Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the Security
Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in
accordance with instructions given by the relevant instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in respect
of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing the Topco
Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee
or the Topco Borrower;

165


-----

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes Trustee,
Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying any agent
under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), the Super Senior Agent, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of
default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a Topco
Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling one hundred and seventy nine 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco
**Standstill Period”);**

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or a
Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
as the Enforcement Action taken by the Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor
and not against any other member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security
Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve
or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco
Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted
remedy); and

(v) the first date on which each of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
and the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have given their consent to the relevant
Enforcement Action.

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to
a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a further
Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other relevant event of default in respect of the Topco
Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may, acting through their
applicable creditor representatives and subject to certain conditions, by giving not less than 10 days’ prior written
notice to the Security Agent, elect to purchase all, but not part of, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Cash Management Facility Liabilities, the Second Lien
Lender Liabilities and the Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay
or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the
counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to
specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been
terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

166

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a Transaction
Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is irrevocably
authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement, instruction, direction,
confirmation, payment, certification or other document, request or information from any creditor, other Secured
Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Issuer to the Security Agent:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Issuer
has confirmed pursuant to paragraph (C) below is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release
and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a
disposal to a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any
obligation of any member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to
provide replacement security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document
pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior
Secured Group; and

in each case where such disposal or other transaction is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) (in each case, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group (to the extent that
the Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document) to effect
any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take
any action in relation to such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of
the Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor
simultaneously with such release to the extent that the Issuer has confirmed that such member
of the Senior Secured Group ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor is in accordance with the terms
of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the New Revolving
Credit Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release is
otherwise in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) and/or return any
physical collateral or take such other action in order to facilitate any transaction not prohibited
by the Secured Debt Documents;

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interests in a Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured
Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other
member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member
of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the
Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities (both actual and
contingent) under the Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its
subsidiaries (and the shares in any such Debtor and/or subsidiary) from the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to a
Debt Document); and

(iii) effect a Debt Pushdown.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A) or (i)(B) above, the Issuer shall confirm in
writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date of completion

167


-----

of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar
transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall confirm in
writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or cessation is
otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined
in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group
or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the
extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that such disposal or other transaction or designation is not
prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or
primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all liabilities
outstanding under any Debt Document to the applicable creditors concurrently with ceasing to be a member of
the Topco Group or Debtor; and any right to decline, delay or prevent any prepayment in any Debt Document
shall be disapplied to the extent that if exercised such right would prevent the repayment of all such liabilities in
full by such person (but without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs or other
payment required by the relevant Finance Documents).

_Debt Pushdown_

The Issuer may at any time require that all of the rights and obligations of any borrower of Super Senior Liabilities,
Senior Lender Liabilities, Pari Passu Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities or any
Notes Issuer (including the Issuer) (each, a “Borrower”) under the applicable Secured Debt Documents (including
under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Notes) be novated or otherwise transferred by that
Borrower (a “Debt Pushdown”) provided that (i) such Debt Pushdown is (A) to another member of the Senior
Secured Group or (B) by a Borrower where (I) that Borrower or any holding company of that Borrower is being
disposed of in accordance with the Finance Documents, and (II) the proceeds of such disposal are not otherwise
required to be applied unconditionally in prepayment of that Borrower’s liabilities under the applicable Finance
Documents, or (C) undertaken in connection with or in contemplation of an IPO Event and (ii) the transferee in
respect of such Debt Pushdown is another borrower under the Super Senior Liabilities, Pari Passu Cash
Management Facility Liabilities, Senior Lender Liabilities Second Lien lender Liabilities or (in the case of a Notes
Issuer) a successor to such Notes Issuer or otherwise permitted or contemplated to assume such Notes Issuer’s
liabilities (including borrowing liabilities) by way of novation or other transfer, in each case under the terms of
the relevant Finance Documents (as applicable). Any Debt Pushdown may (and shall upon the request of the
Issuer) be effected on a cashless basis, by way of book entries and not as physical cash movement to repay and
reborrow any applicable liabilities.

“Notes Issuer” means any issuer of Senior Secured Notes, Second Lien Notes and/or Topco Notes, as the context
requires.

Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement (other than a member of the Senior Secured Group) shall be required
to enter into any amendment or supplement to, release of, waiver under or replacement of any Debt Document
required by the Issuer (or another member of the Senior Secured Group) and/or take such other action as is required
by the Issuer (or another member of the Senior Secured Group) in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by the Debt Pushdown provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, provided that such amendment,
supplement, waiver, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the
Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunity of the Security Agent
under such amendment, release, replacement or other document or instrument. The Agents and the Security Agent
are each irrevocably and unconditionally authorised and instructed by and on behalf of each applicable party
(without any further consent required) to the Intercreditor Agreement to execute any such amended, supplemented,
waived, released or replacement Debt Document and/or take other such action on behalf of such parties (and shall
do so on the request of the Issuer).

_Distressed Disposals_

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a member
of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any asset of that Third Party
Security Provider which is subject to Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an

168


-----

acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made (including, without
limitation, the disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities of a member of the Senior Secured
Group which have been appropriated or foreclosed in accordance with the terms of such Transaction Security),
(b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the
time the request for enforcement was made, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event which has occurred
and is continuing or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event which has
occurred and is continuing, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a
member of the Topco Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized at the cost of
the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security Provider or
Debtor:

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into
any release of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any
floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered
necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B)
any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets or
the holding company of that Debtor over that Debtor’s shares, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group
lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the
assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers
and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company
or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intragroup lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets or
over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors provided
that, in relation to any Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities (as defined below), the Security Agent
shall not be entitled to release such Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities if and to the extent such
release would expose the directors of the relevant Intra-Group Lender or the relevant Debtor to the risk
of becoming personally liable pursuant to Section 43 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act
(GmbHG) or, in relation to an Intra-Group Lender or Debtor not incorporated in Germany, pursuant to
similar rules under applicable laws;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose
of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries
to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Creditor
or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that,
notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated
as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement) to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all
(and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Creditors and all or part of any other
liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors; and

169


-----

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a
Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed
Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the IntraGroup Liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor (“Debtor Liabilities”), to execute and deliver or enter
into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Debtor
Liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations
are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also
a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the
obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the
Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities are to be transferred.

Any enforcement limitations or limitations on the application of enforcement proceeds agreed in the Transaction
Security over any Intra-Group Liabilities and/or any Debtor Liabilities shall apply mutatis mutandis to any
disposal or transfer pursuant to paragraph (iv) above and in relation to paragraph (v) above (A) to any Intra-Group
Lender and creditor of Debtor Liabilities if and to the extent the Receiving Entity is of a weaker credit than the
Disposed Entity or (B) in case the Receiving Entity is a member of the Senior Secured Group, to such member of
the Senior Secured Group, in each case as if such disposal or transfer was an enforcement of such Transaction
Security.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction_
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not
occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal
or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed
to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior
Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and
have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to
release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to
any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities
and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case
of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, any Second Lien Liabilities, any Topco
Liabilities, any Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities or any Unsecured Liabilities would otherwise be
released pursuant to the provisions described above, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing
liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those
borrowing liabilities.

Lien Borrower or issuer of Second Lien Notes or assets of a Second Lien Borrower, issuer of Second Lien Notes,
Second Lien Guarantor or Topco Guarantor (in each case as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) will be
released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release, transfer or disposal that

of the Priority Secured Parties and are being sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement
Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with
such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates), and all security under
documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations in respect of the assets that

the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same (II) where the Second Lien
Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent and the Second Lien Notes

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made (I) pursuant to a
Competitive Sales Process or (II) where a reputable, independent and internationally recognized

171


-----

investment bank, firm of accountants or third party professional firm which is regularly engaged
in providing valuations in respect of the relevant type and size of the assets concerned, in each
case selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise valuation
of the Senior Secured Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and disclosed to
the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a nonreliance basis) in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection
therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances
including the method of enforcement provided that the liability of such investment bank or firm
of accountants or third party professional firm (as applicable) in giving such opinion may be
limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall act (i) if the relevant Distressed
Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance with the provisions
set out under “—Manner of Enforcement” above, and (ii) in any other case on the instructions of the Instructing
Group or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no
action).

**_Release of Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

If a member of the Senior Secured Group is designated as an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and obliged (at the cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or
Debtor): (a) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that member
of the Senior Secured Group’s assets and its shares; and (b) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the
Transaction Security or any claim described in paragraph (a) above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization
of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered
necessary or desirable or as reasonably requested by the Issuer.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

Subject to certain provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement and to the proviso described below, all amounts
from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Debt Document (other

Secured Group) in respect of any Topco Liabilities or Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) or in connection with the
realization or enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security (such amounts being the “Recoveries”)
shall be applied at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit to the extent permitted by applicable
law, in the following order of priority:

or the Topco Liabilities and any sums owed to the Security Agent and any receiver or delegate on a pari

enforcement of all or any part of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security) shall be
held by the Security Agent on trust to apply them at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit to
the extent permitted by applicable law (and subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement), in the
following order of priority:

(A) in accordance with paragraph (i) above;

(B) in accordance with paragraph (ii) above;

(C) in accordance with paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) above (in each case only to the extent there are

_Order of Application—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to certain provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, all amounts from time to time received or
recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Topco Document in connection with the realization
or enforcement of Topco Independent Transaction Security or any guarantees provided by a Topco Guarantor
(other than a member of the Senior Secured Group) (the “Topco Recoveries”) shall be held by the Security Agent

173


-----

on trust and be applied at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by
applicable law and subject to the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, in the following order of priority:

(i) in discharging any agent Liabilities in respect of the Topco Liabilities (to the extent related to such Topco
Recoveries), the Security Agent and any receiver or delegate, on a pari passu basis;

(ii) in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any agent or Topco Creditor in connection with any
realization or enforcement of the Topco Independent Transaction Security taken in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of the Security Agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(iii) for application towards the discharge of:

(A) the Topco Facility Liabilities; and

(B) the Topco Notes Liabilities,

on a pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between paragraphs (A) and (B) above;

(iv) if none of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers is under any further actual or contingent liability
in respect of the Secured Liabilities, in payment to any other person whom the Security Agent is obliged
to pay in priority to any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider; and

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor or Third Party Security Provider.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Recoveries attributable to a Debtor in respect of any Excluded Swap
Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) may be applied towards the payment of such Excluded
Swap Obligations.

**_Equitable Subordination_**

Notwithstanding the provisions described above under “Order of Application—Transaction Security” and “Order
_of Application—Topco Independent Transaction Security”, to the extent that the Recoveries held by the Security_
Agent are insufficient to discharge the liabilities owed to all creditors in any class of creditors and this is due
(whether in whole or in part) to any creditor (such creditor being an “Equitably Subordinated Creditor”) whose
commitments, any other participation rights (including by way of sub-participation) and/or any other rights and
claims under the Debt Documents against a Debtor incorporated in Germany which, prior to or in an insolvency
of the Debtor, would be subordinated or could be subject to potential avoidance claims pursuant to certain
provisions under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or the German Avoidance Act
(Anfechtungsgesetz) (“Equitably Subordinated Liabilities”) being part of that class of creditors, the amount to
be applied by the Security Agent in discharge of the liabilities of that class of creditors shall be distributed to the
other creditors of that class and the Equitably Subordinated Creditor shall not be entitled to receive any part of
that amount.

An Equitably Subordinated Creditor shall not have the benefit, but only the obligations, of any sharing provisions
in the Debt Documents, and shall not be entitled to receive any payment and neither the Security Agent nor the
agent shall be required to make any payment to the Equitable Subordinated Creditor, under or in connection with
the Debt Documents in respect of any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities.

To the extent that any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities would result in the subordination of liabilities towards
any other creditors under any Debt Document pursuant to Section 39 para. 1 no. 5 of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) or prejudice the validity or enforceability of any Transaction Security or guarantee and/or
indemnity provided to any creditor pursuant to the Debt Documents in any way, the relevant Equitably
Subordinated Creditor shall be deemed not to be a Secured Party under any Transaction Security Document and
shall not benefit from the guarantee or indemnity.

**_Equalisation_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior Secured
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first
date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses
are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at

174


-----

the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement
Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall
require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses
are borne in those proportions except that no Recoveries attributable to a Debtor in respect of any Excluded Swap
Obligations may be applied towards the payment of such Excluded Swap Obligations (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement).

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security Agent,
provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and such
amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of
the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the relevant agent or trustee acting on behalf of the
affected class (or in the case of hedging counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty) and the Issuer shall be
required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to, among
other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior
Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities,

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender in respect of Super Senior Cash Management Facility Liabilities
(only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would (A) materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement
(solely in their capacity as such) and (B) not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors, in each case other than such Cash Management Facility Lenders
(solely in their capacity as such)),

(iii) each Cash Management Facility Lender in respect of Pari Passu Cash Management Facility Liabilities
(only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would (A) materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement
(solely in their capacity as such) and (B) not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors, in each case other than such Cash Management Facility Lenders
(solely in their capacity as such)),

(iv) each hedge counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would (A) materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement
(solely in their capacity as such) and (B) not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors, in each case other than the hedge counterparties (solely in their
capacity as such)), and

(v) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent it is consented to by the requisite percentage of creditors it represents or
as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or authorizations in
accordance therewith (save to the extent that any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision
affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the relevant Security Agent
may, (a) if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents
under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be
binding on each party, and (b) without prejudice to any further assurance provision in any Debt Document, may,
if the Issuer consents, amend or release and retake any any document creating Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security where such amendment or release and retake is required or desirable in order
to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the relevant Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security (as applicable), together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure to
register any relevant document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in section 859 of

175


-----

the Companies Act 2006, in which case any payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to
register shall also be automatically and irrevocably waived) and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake
shall be binding on each Party, and (c) with the prior consent of the Secured Creditors and the Issuer is required
to authorize any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction Security
or Topco Independent Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject
to Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) or the manner in which
the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are
distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the third paragraph below, if the amendment, waiver or consent may impose new or additional
obligations on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any Party other than in the case of a Secured Creditor (other
than an agent or arranger), in a way which affects or would affect Secured Creditors of that Party’s class generally,
or in the case of a Debtor, to the extent consented to by the Issuer, the consent of that party is required.

Subject to the next paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without
limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not
be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security
_Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to_

(i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claims or liabilities, or

(ii) to any amendment waiver or consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt
_Financings,” “—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment,_
waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such
matters can be effected solely by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to:

(i) a request for a consent in relation to any of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document (other than a notes indenture) which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(ii) a request to participate in any vote of a class of creditors under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any other Debt Document (other than a notes indenture) which does not contain a similar snooze/lose
provision or which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement);

(iii) a request to approve any other action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other Debt
Document (other than a notes indenture) which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or which
applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement); or

(iv) a request to provide any confirmation or notification under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any other
Debt Document (other than a notes indenture) which does not contain a similar snooze/lose provision or
which applies a longer period than that specified in the Intercreditor Agreement),

then, in each case, any creditor:

(A) fails to respond to that request within ten (10) Business Days or if such Secured Creditor or
Unsecured Creditor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) is a Defaulting Lender (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), five (5) Business Days (or any other period of time
notified by the Issuer, with the prior agreement of the Agents if the period for this provision to
operate is less than ten (10) Business Days) of that request being made; or

176


-----

(B) fails to provide details of its participation within the timescale specified by the Security Agent,

then, at the Issuer’s option:

(1) that creditor’s participation (as the case may be) shall be deemed to be zero for the
purpose of calculating their participation in respect of the matter when ascertaining
whether any relevant percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unamity) of
the participations of the specified group of creditors has been obtained to give that
consent, carry that vote or approve that action; and

(2) that creditor’s status shall be disregarded for the purposes of ascertaining whether the
agreement of any specified group of creditors has been obtained to give that consent,
carry that vote or approve that action; or

(3) that creditor shall be deemed (other than for the purposes of determining any consent
fee or similar arrangement) to have given its consent or agreement to such request (or
to have given such confirmation or notification) and such consent, agreement,
confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have been received by the Security
Agent, and such consent, agreement, confirmation or notification shall from such time
be irrevocable and binding on such creditor and its permitted successors, assigns and
transferees,

**_provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Snooze/Loose clause shall not apply to any Noteholder_**
in respect of any request where such Noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request in the
negative but shall otherwise apply to all Noteholders.

**_Provisions Following an IPO_**

On or following, or in contemplation of, an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a
holding company thereof) (an “IPO Event”)), the Issuer is entitled to require (by written notice to each agent and
each Hedge Counterparty (such notice being a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Debt Documents will
automatically operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice (the “IPO Pushdown
**Date”)) so that, amongst other things, (i) references to the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will**
now refer to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time, (ii) all financial ratio
calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall be made excluding any holding company of the
IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity (or
as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the relevant Debt Documents), (iii) each reference in the Debt
Documents to the Issuer or any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be deemed to be a reference
to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise), (iv) certain
provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings, covenants, defaults and events of
default), will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (v) no event, matter or
circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall directly or indirectly constitute
or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking, covenant of event of default, (vi) each holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations and
restrictions under the Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security) and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer, each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security
Provider, Investor (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor
will be irrevocably and unconditionally released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor
Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

“IPO **Pushdown Entity” means, at the election of the Issuer (in its sole discretion), either, (a) the member of the**
Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold
pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Issuer”), or (b) a subsidiary of the IPO Issuer selected by the Issuer (in its sole
discretion) which (directly or indirectly) will, on and from the IPO Pushdown Date, own all or substantially all of
the assets of the Senior Secured Group immediately prior to the occurrence of the IPO Pushdown Date, provided
that, if, at the IPO Pushdown Date, there are any Topco Notes or Topco Liabilities then in existence which are not
refinanced or discharged on or before the IPO Pushdown Date:

(A) to the extent that any Topco Borrower is a holding company of the Issuer, the Issuer may elect
(in its sole discretion) that the IPO Pushdown provisions shall operate such that: (I) for the
purposes of the Topco Group or Topco Liabilities, that Topco Borrower shall be the IPO

177


-----

Pushdown Entity and the Topco Group (and all related provisions) shall comprise that IPO
Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; and (II) for the purposes of
the Senior Secured Group or Secured Liabilities other than the Topco Liabilities (and all related
provisions), references to the “IPO Pushdown Entity” which would have been applicable but for
the application of sub-paragraph (I) above shall be construed as reference to the direct subsidiary
of the IPO Pushdown Entity as determined by sub-paragraph (I) above and its Restricted
Subsidiaries from time to time; and

(B) to the extent that any Topco Borrower is a member of the Senior Secured Group, the Issuer may
not nominate that Topco Borrower as the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facilities
Agreement or any substantially equivalent term in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or any
Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Permitted Second Lien Facility
Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes
Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released from
all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than,
in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any
amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement (other than a member of the Senior Secured Group) shall be required
to enter into any amendment or supplement to, release of, waiver under or replacement of any Debt Document
required by the Issuer (or another member of the Senior Secured Group) and/or take such other action as is required
by the Issuer (or another member of the Senior Secured Group) in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by the foregoing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, _provided that such amendment,_
supplement, waiver, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the
Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunity of the Security Agent
under such amendment, release, replacement or other document or instrument. The Agents and the Security Agent
are each irrevocably and unconditionally authorised and instructed by and on behalf of each applicable party
(without any further consent required) to the Intercreditor Agreement to execute any such amended, supplemented,
waived, released or replacement Debt Document and/or take other such action on behalf of such parties (and shall
do so on the request of the Issuer).

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary, provided that certain “excluded matters” provisions in the New Revolving Credit
Facilities Agreement shall not be overruled by the Intercreditor Agreement and shall apply _mutatis mutandis in_
the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law and Jurisdiction_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are
governed by English law, and disputes are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of England in London.

**Securitization Program**

We established a securitization program in 2020 with UniCredit Bank AG as administrative agent and accounts
administrator. Specifically, on May 6, 2020, CABB AG and CABB GmbH (, as well as CABB Group GmbH, as
guarantor, executed a Receivables Purchase and Servicing Agreement with Elektra Purchase No. 68 DAC, as
purchaser. An amended and restated receivables purchase and servicing agreement was executed on December
11, 2020 when the program expanded to include CABB Oy and on December 8, 2022 when the program expanded
to include Jayhawk (together, the “Securitization Program”). Under the Securitization Program, the sellers offer
to sell and assign eligible receivables on a revolving basis to the purchaser, without recourse, and the purchaser is
committed to purchase such eligible receivables for a specified purchase period, subject to certain conditions. The
aggregate of all purchased receivables shall not exceed €50,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022
(December 31, 2021: €30,000,000). Elektra Purchase No. 68 DAC obtains its primary funding through the
issuance of commercial papers. Each seller assigns and transfers to the purchaser all ancillary rights in relation to

178


-----

a receivable and all rights, title and interest in related security as described therein. We are entitled to annual
administration fees and servicing fees subject to certain conditions of €36,000.00.

From an accounting perspective, the net amount is presented as part of other financial receivables and represents
the Group’s right to receive this amount once the trade receivables sold have been settled by the customers. To
the extent to which the credit risk is retained by the Group (continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and
corresponding other financial liabilities are recognized. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of trade
receivables transferred under the securitization program amounted to €33.0 million (December 31, 2021: €24.3
million and December 31, 2020: €23.8 million), of which €32.2 million have been derecognized (December 31,
2021: €23.7 million and December 31, 2020: €23.3 million).

**Factoring Program**

In 2019 and 2020, certain entites of the Group entered into factoring agreements with one of our customers in
connection with the sale and assignment to such customer of certain trade receivables (the “Factoring Program”).
The factoring agreement contains customary representations and warranties and is governed by English law. As
of December 31, 2022 we had sold trade receivables in a total amount of €10.9 million (December 31, 2021: €11.4
million) under to the Factoring Program.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading
“Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer” are to Monitchem
Holdco 3 S.A. only and not to any of its Subsidiaries. References to “we” or “us” are to the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Issuer will issue EUR 670 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, consisting of EUR 420
million aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”)
and EUR 250 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Floating
**Rate Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the “Initial Notes”). The Notes will be issued under an**
indenture to be dated as of April 28, 2023 (the “Indenture”), between, _inter alios, the Issuer and the Initial_
Guarantors, as guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch, as paying agent and calculation agent (the “Paying Agent” and the “Calculation Agent”, as
applicable), Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”) and registrar (the
“Registrar”), and GLAS Trust Corporation Limited, as security agent (the “Security Agent”), in a private
transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be
qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We
urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they,
and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum
under the caption “Listing and General Information.”

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together with cash on
balance sheet, to (i) redeem the Existing Notes in full (including paying the accrued and unpaid interest), (ii) pay
the applicable redemption premium for the Existing Notes, and (iii) pay related fees and expenses, as set forth in
this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors
on a senior basis. See “—The Note Guarantees.”

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for
undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security
and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will
have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other
remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture.
However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we
will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the
Notes.

**The Notes**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the
Revolving Facility Agreement, certain cash management obligations and certain Hedging Obligations;
_provided that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a distressed disposal of_
the Collateral or an enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, counterparties to certain cash
management obligations, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future super priority indebtedness
permitted under the Indenture, if any, and creditors under the Revolving Facility Agreement will be repaid

180


-----

with the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal in priority to the
Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including obligations to trade
creditors) of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes,
to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligations;

- be guaranteed by the Guarantors as described under “—The Note Guarantees”;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are
not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors;

- mature on May 1, 2028; and

- be represented by one or more registered Notes in global registered form, but in certain circumstances may
be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”).

All of the operations of the Issuer are conducted through the Issue Date Guarantor and its Subsidiaries and,
therefore, the Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations
under the Notes. Under applicable Germany regulations, cash and cash equivalents held by the Issue Date
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries can only be upstreamed to their direct or indirect parent entities, including to the
Issuer for purposes of servicing the Notes, to the extent that sufficient cumulative distributable profits and
cumulative reserves exist within these legal entities and that they continue to meet the relevant minimum capital
requirements.

As of December 31, 2022, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on that date,
the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had EUR 670 million of secured Indebtedness. In addition,
there would have been EUR 110 million available for drawing under the Revolving Facility.

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (i) on or about the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantor; and
(ii) within 120 days of the Issue Date, by the Additional CABB Guarantors (together with the Issue Date
Guarantor, the “Initial Guarantors”). In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed_
Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future (the
“Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). The Note Guarantees will
be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including that Guarantor’s obligations
under the Revolving Facility Agreement and certain cash management obligations and certain Hedging
Obligations; provided that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a distressed
disposal of the Collateral or an enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, creditors under the
Revolving Facility and certain other future super priority indebtedness permitted under the Indenture, if any,
will be repaid with the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation; and

181


-----

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness, including obligations to trade creditors,
of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial
assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention
of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things,
might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant
Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied
with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply
to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Facility and the
Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations
or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors,
including the Holders of the Notes, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee.

For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Guarantors represented
99.5% of the Group Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in this Offering Memorandum and disregarding the EBITDA
of any member of the Group that generates negative EBITDA). Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted
Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority
stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the
assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer
(other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As of
December 31, 2022, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries
would have had approximately EUR 15,000 of Indebtedness of Subsidiaries other than the Guarantors. Although
the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not
impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

**_Note Guarantees Release_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the sale or other disposition does
not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially all the
assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the Indenture;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

- upon the release of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such Guarantor’s
obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on
_Additional Guarantees”;_

- with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to the extent that (i) such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its
liabilities with respect to the Revolving Facility prior to or substantially concurrently with such termination

182


-----

and release and (ii) such Guarantor would not otherwise be required at the time of such release to provide a
Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees”;_

- in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

- with respect to an entity that is not the successor Guarantor, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Guarantors.”_

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer,
including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee
and the Security Agent without the consent of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part
of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue EUR 670 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes,
consisting of EUR 420 million aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes and EUR 250 million aggregate
principal amount of Floating Rate Notes. The Notes will mature on May 1, 2028. The Notes will be issued in
minimum denominations of EUR 100,000 and integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of 8.75% per annum. Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will:

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

- be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15, commencing on
December 15, 2023;

- be payable to the holder of record of such Fixed Rate Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the
related interest payment date (or such other record date as specified in the relevant Fixed Rate Notes and/or
permitted or otherwise required for Fixed Rate Notes issued in global form by the procedures of the applicable
clearing system); and

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months on the aggregate principal
amount outstanding.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal
to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (subject to a zero floor) plus (ii) 5.25%, as determined by the Calculation
Agent.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will:

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

- be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15, commencing
on September 15, 2023;

- be payable to the holder of record of such Floating Rate Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding
the related interest payment date (or such other record date as specified in the relevant Floating Rate Notes
and/or permitted or otherwise required for Floating Rate Notes issued in global form by the procedures of the
applicable clearing system); and

183


-----

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed on the aggregate principal
amount outstanding.

Interest on overdue principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than
the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest
on the Floating Rate Notes.

“Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days
preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits
in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11.00 a.m. Brussels time, on the
Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a
Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the
Eurozone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a
percentage per annum) as of approximately 11.00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks
in the Eurozone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such
offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.
If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as
selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately
11.00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading
European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic
mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the
rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. If, in any case, that rate determined in
accordance with the above is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero.

If the Issuer determines in good faith prior to any Determination Date, that:

1. there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

2. EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

3. there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

4. an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital
markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

5. it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to calculate
any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR,

the Issuer in consultation with a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable
manner, shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been
recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or
by a widely recognized industry association or body or that has developed or is expected to develop as an industry
accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Floating Rate Notes (and any applicable
adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any
economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the
“Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall
certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at
least two Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon
which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and
absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be
used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be bound by any such Successor
Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee; provided that
if the Calculation Agent is unable (based on the information provided by the Issuer with respect to such Successor
Rate or Adjustment Spread (if any) to calculate, or calculate definitely, the interest rate applicable to the Interest
Period commencing immediately following notification thereof, then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period

184


-----

will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. For the avoidance of
doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall, in all cases, not be less than zero. The
Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread).
Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to “EURIBOR” in the
Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread).

“Eurozone” means the region comprising member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and
including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the
first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include December 15, 2023,
with respect to the Fixed Rate Notes, and September 15, 2023, with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.

“Rate Determination Agent” means (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an
independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the
Issuer at the expense of the Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under
(a), the Issuer.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (1) EUR 1.0 million and (2) an amount that is representative for
a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (T2) System is open, or any successor system to the replacement of the T2 system.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date,
determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following
Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable
Rate to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying
each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages
resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or
.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest
Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and
binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted
by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the
rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment
is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such
delay. The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes will be subject to the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be
made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by
the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained**
for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer,
by bank transfer to the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive
Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes (including the initial Paying Agent). The initial
Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the “Paying Agent”).

185


-----

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank
Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time
to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the
Holders of such Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of
the Notes.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to issue_
additional Notes of the same or different series, which shall have terms substantially identical to this series of
Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate supplied
to the Trustee (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the issue price and issuance date of such Additional Notes;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and,
if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates,
the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest
shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the
determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest
will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(6) the maturity date, and the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which,
and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of EUR 100,000 and in integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof,
the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

In the Issuer’s sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pertaining to (a)
the redemption of such Additional Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, pursuant to any special
mandatory redemption in the event that the release from any escrow into which proceeds of the issuance of such
Additional Notes are deposited is conditioned on the consummation of any acquisition, Investment, refinancing
or other transaction (such redemption, a “Special Mandatory Redemption”), (b) the escrow of all or a portion
of the proceeds of such Additional Notes and the granting of Liens described in clause (22) of the definition of
“Permitted Liens” in favor of the Trustee or a security agent solely for the benefit of the holders of such Additional
Notes (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of the holders of any other Notes, including Notes of
the same series as such Additional Notes), together with all necessary authorizations for the Trustee or such
security agent to enter into such arrangements provided that, for so long as the proceeds of such Additional Notes
are in escrow, such Additional Notes shall benefit only from such Liens and shall not be subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and shall not benefit from any security interest in the
Collateral. In addition, such Officer’s Certificate may include provisions pursuant to which such Additional Notes
are issued bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, such
as the consummation of an acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction, and such Additional Notes
bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code may be automatically exchanged for new Additional Notes
bearing the same CUSIP, ISIN or common code as any existing Notes issued. Additional Notes may be designated

186


-----

to be of the same series as any other series of Notes, including the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but
only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such other series, and shall be deemed to
form one series with other series (including, if applicable, such Notes) (it being understood that any Additional
Notes that are substantially identical in all material respects to any other series of Notes but for being subject to a
Special Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to be substantially identical to such series of Notes only following
the expiration of any provisions relating to such Special Mandatory Redemption).

All series of Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
any applicable series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description
_of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue_
Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as any other
series of Notes, including the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to such other series and shall be deemed to form one series with such other series
(it being understood that any Additional Notes that are substantially identical in all material respects to any other
series of Notes but for being subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption shall be deemed to be substantially
identical to such series of Notes only following the expiration of any provisions relating to such Special Mandatory
Redemption).

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:

- each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be
deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream; and

- each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation
S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”
In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will
be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules
and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S
**Book-Entry Interests”) denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a written**
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction._

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Global Fixed Rate Notes”)
and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Fixed Rate Notes
(the “Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes”) may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in
any Global Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the “Global Floating Rate Notes”) or any Definitive

187


-----

Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes (the “Definitive
**Registered Floating Rate Notes”), and (ii) no Book-Entry Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes and no**
Definitive Registered Floating Rate Note may be transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any
Global Fixed Rate Note or any Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of EUR 100,000
principal amount, and integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on
transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of EUR 100,000 in principal amount
and integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear
or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection
with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other
than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and the
terms of the security documents, the Notes will be secured by the following first priority security interests ranking
_pari passu with the security interests securing the Revolving Facility, certain cash management obligations and_
certain Hedging Obligations (collectively, the “Super Senior Obligations”) (subject to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement):

- a German law governed share pledge granted by the Issuer over its shares in the Issue Date Guarantor;

- a Luxembourg law governed security agreement granted by the Issuer over any material structural
intercompany loan receivables owed to it by any member of the Group;

- a German law governed security assignment agreement by the Issue Date Guarantor over any material
structural intercompany loan receivables owed to it by any member of the Group, and

188


-----

- a Luxembourg law governed security agreement granted by the Issuer over any material bank accounts of the
Issuer located in Luxembourg;

(collectively, the “Issue Date Collateral”).

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer will be required to cause,
within 120 days of the Issue Date and subject to certain perfection requirements and the terms of the security
documents, the Notes to be secured by the following first-priority security interests ranking pari passu with the
Super Senior Obligations (subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement):

- a German law governed share pledge granted by CABB Holding GmbH over its shares in CABB GmbH;

- a Swiss law governed share pledge granted by CABB Europe GmbH over its shares in CABB AG;

- a Finnish law governed share pledge granted by CABB Finland Oy over its shares in CABB OY;

- a New York law governed share pledge granted by Kansas HoldCo 1, Inc. over its shares in Jayhawk Fine
Chemicals Corporation; and

- a New York law governed all asset security collateral agreement granted by Jayhawk Fine Chemicals
Corporation over its assets (subject to customary exclusions, which shall include, without limitation, real
estate and intellectual property and receivables/factoring bank accounts),

(collectively, the “Post-Issue Date Collateral” and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

The assets that comprise the Collateral will also secure on a first-priority basis, the Revolving Facility, certain
cash management obligations and certain Hedging Obligations and may also secure certain future Indebtedness.

As described above, the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Facility, certain cash
management obligations and certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain
future Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations owed to the holders of the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with
this issuance of Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at
all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—The Collateral may not be sufficient to
_secure the obligations under the Notes.”_

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets_
may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, including (but not
limited to) the following:

- no security or guarantees shall be granted (i) by a member of the Group which is not incorporated under the
laws of Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, any state within the United States and the District of
Columbia or any other jurisdiction in which a borrower under the Revolving Facility Agreement is
incorporated, but only for so long as any borrower is incorporated in such jurisdiction (each a “Guarantor
**Jurisdiction”); and/or (ii) over the shares of a member of the Group not incorporated in a Guarantor**
Jurisdiction;

- no security or guarantees shall be required to be given by (or over shares or investments in) any joint venture
or similar arrangement, any minority interest or by (or over shares or investments in) any member of the
Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group

- security shall be limited to: (i) the shares directly owned in a borrower, including the shares in the Issue Date
Guarantor under the Revolving Facility Agreement or a Material Company (as defined in the Revolving
Facility Agreement); and (ii) material structural intragroup loan receivables owed to a borrower or Material
Company (as defined in the Revolving Facility Agreement);

- all security (other than share security) shall be governed by the law of, and shall secure only assets located
in, the jurisdiction of, incorporation of the guarantor (it being understood that for any obligor incorporated or
organized under the laws of the United States of America, any state of the United States of America or the
District of Columbia, the governing law of the security agreement shall be the laws of the State of New York)

189


-----

and no action in relation to security (including any perfection step, further assurance step, filing or
registration) will be required in jurisdictions where the grantor of the security is not incorporated;

- share security over any subsidiary will be governed by the law of the place of incorporation of that subsidiary
(or in the case of any US subsidiary, New York law). Any security over a structural intercompany loan will
be governed by the governing law of such structural intra-group loan document or English law;

- the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security may be prohibited, restricted or limited
by an amount or otherwise, including as a result of general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory
restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit,
capital maintenance, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “interest stripping,” “earnings
stripping,” capital maintenance rules and liquidity impairment rules, “controlled foreign corporation,”
transfer pricing or “thin capitalization” rules, “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, exchange control
restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements (including supervisory
board or “works council” rules) and similar principles. If any such limit applies, the guarantees and security
provided will be limited accordingly; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before
signing any applicable finance document the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors
(but without incurring material cost or fees and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to
overcome any such limitation but otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such
limit;

- a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or security will be taken (and
in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration), the applicable time, cost and adverse
effect shall be taken into account. This would mean taking into account factors such as adverse effects on
taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration fees, costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and
all applicable legal fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities
or other financing arrangements, including any recourse or non-recourse factoring (including reverse
factoring), arrangements, receivables financings, trust receipts, invoice discounts or similar arrangements (in
each case permitted under the Indenture) which shall not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the
Holders of such guarantee or security;

- assets of the Group maybe subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory
constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party
arrangement which may prevent or condition that asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the
applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works
council (or equivalent)). Any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third
party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any
member of the Group in respect of the asset or require any member of the Group to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, will be excluded from a guarantee or security
document _provided that, reasonable endeavors exercised for a specified period of time which shall be no_
longer than 20 Business Days (but without incurring material cost or fees and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to obtain consent to charging any such assets (where otherwise prohibited)
shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies before signing any applicable security document
or accession document that the relevant asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will
not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favour of a third party (other than in relation
to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation
of transaction security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and
such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

- guarantees or entry into security documents shall not be required of members of the Group if it is not within
the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory
duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction
or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of
or for any member of the Group; provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing
any applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with
third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such security or guarantee document shall be subject
to such limit;

190


-----

- the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security
granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member
of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the
finance documents including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending,
waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an
acceleration event which is continuing, and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek
consent of any person or take or not take any other action is subject to this principle;

- no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations”;

- no entity incorporated under the laws of Switzerland (a “Swiss Entity”) shall be obliged to grant any upstream
or cross-stream security over its assets or guarantee unless: (i) appropriate “10/20” non-bank limitations are
included in the relevant debt instrument; or (ii) a satisfactory federal tax ruling is obtained in respect of the
proposed security or guarantee, as applicable (in relation to the proposed debt);

- no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

- no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required.

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally
available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law, see “Certain
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the
Revolving Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations (if any), (c) the counterparties under
certain cash management facilities (if any); (d) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Notes under
the Indenture, and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Collateral,
respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Revolving Facility, the Indenture, the
Security Documents and the security documents relating to the Revolving Facility and such Hedging Obligations
and such cash management obligations, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under the
Revolving Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain cash management obligations and the Notes are
secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests; however, under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after certain
super senior priority obligations including (i) obligations under the Revolving Facility, (ii) certain cash
management obligations (if any) and (iii) certain Hedging Obligations (if any) have been paid in full. In addition,
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date,
the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Initial Guarantors have granted, or will grant, security over the
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the
Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents have been, or will be, entered into by the
relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the Security
Documents, the Security Agent has acted in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including
itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders under the Revolving Facility and the counterparties under certain
Hedging Obligations and certain cash management obligations created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws,
only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to
take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the

191


-----

Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide
instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by security interests in the Collateral
until all obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the
security interests in the Collateral with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the security
interests in the Collateral created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the security
interests in the Collateral or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able
to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Agreed Security Principles, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain
in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the property and
assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom (including any and all
dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of Capital Stock of the Guarantors that
is part of the Collateral).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the
security interests in the Collateral and provide for the release of the security interests in the Collateral created by
the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Revolving Facility,
certain cash management providers (if any) or certain hedge counterparties (if any). The ability to enforce may
also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in
compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The creditors under the Revolving Facility, certain cash management providers, the counterparties to Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as their respective agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the
Revolving Facility, the holders of Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral,
certain cash management providers and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have, authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions
that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security
Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and that the
Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the holders of the Notes) to enter into
the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents;

(3) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

192


-----

(4) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants— Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_IPO Pushdown_**

On, in contemplation of, or following an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will provide (and the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such
provisions) that the Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the
Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions
_Following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment or_
supplement to, release of, waiver under or replacement of any debt document (including the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the Security Documents) required
by the Issuer (or another member of the Group) and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer (or
another member of the Group) in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by this paragraph,
_provided that any such amendment, supplement, waiver, replacement or other document, instrument or action will_
not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee
or Security Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Collateral—There are
_circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and_
_the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will be released_
_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.”_

**_Debt Pushdown_**

The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will provide (and the
Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to
require that its liabilities (including borrowing liabilities under the Notes) under the applicable secured debt
documents (including the Notes and the Indenture) be novated or otherwise transferred by the Issuer as described
under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Debt Pushdown” (a “Debt
**Pushdown”).**

The Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall provide that the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment or supplement to, release of, waiver under or
replacement of any debt document (including the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the Security Documents) required by the Issuer (or another member of the Group)
and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer (or another member of the Group) in order to facilitate
or reflect any of the matters contemplated by this paragraph, _provided that any such amendment, supplement,_
waiver, replacement or other document, instrument or action will not impose any personal obligations on the
Security Agent or, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Security
Agent under such amendment, supplement, waiver, release, replacement or other document or instrument. See
“Risk Factors—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the
_Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes_
_Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to release the security interests in
respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—_
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in_

193


-----

accordance with the Indenture, or (b) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary provided that this clause
1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or accounts receivable to the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary) unless (subject to the Agreed Securities
Principles) the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in
favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in connection with the granting of Liens or rights with respect to property and assets, which may include
Collateral, or the sale or transfer of property or assets, which may include Collateral, in each case pursuant
to a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(7) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization or in connection with the
Migration;

(8) in connection with a Public Offering within a reasonable time to facilitate such Public Offering; provided
that such security interests in the Collateral so released shall be promptly granted in favor of the Notes
in the event that the Public Offering does not complete for any reason;

(9) in case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following the release of its Liens
granted in favor of the Revolving Facility, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
the release of the property and assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary; provided that there
is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary that would result
in the requirement for the Notes and the Notes Guarantees to be secured on such property, assets or
Capital Stock pursuant to covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees” or the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens;” or_

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the security interests in the Collateral created by the Security Documents will be released (a) pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee will take all necessary action reasonably requested in writing by the Issuer to
effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Document subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless
action is required by it to effect such release).

from the commencement of the current Interest Period to, and including, May 1, 2024 computed
upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate at such redemption date
plus 50 basis points; over

b. the outstanding principal amount of such Floating Rate Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate. For the avoidance
of doubt, calculation of Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the Trustee or any Agent.

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct obligations
of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially compiled
and published in the most recent financial statistics that have become publicly available at least two Business
Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial statistics are not
so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected in good faith by the Board
of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to, with respect
to the Fixed Rate Notes, May 1, 2025 or, with respect to the Floating Rate Notes, May 1, 2024; provided, however,
that if the period from the redemption date to, with respect to the Fixed Rate Notes, May 1, 2025 or, with respect
to the Floating Rate Notes, May 1, 2024, is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal
Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear
interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations
of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption
date to, with respect to the Fixed Rate Notes, May 1, 2025 or, with respect to the Floating Rate Notes, May 1,
2024, is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of the Federal Republic
of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used, unless the redemption price is not paid on
the redemption date.

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, any series of or all of the Notes, if Holders of
not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes or series of Notes, as applicable,
validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes or series of Notes, as applicable, in such tender offer and
the Issuer, or any third party making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes or series of
Notes, as applicable, validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders of the Notes
will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will
have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice following such purchase date, to redeem all
Notes or series of Notes, as applicable, that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the
price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer (other than any early tender premium, incentive payment or
similar payment), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

196


-----

**_Optional Redemption and Satisfaction and Discharge_**

If the Issuer elects to redeem any series of the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a satisfaction and
discharge or defeasance of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Defeasance” or “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge,” requests that the Trustee distribute (or cause to be distributed) to the Holders amounts_
deposited in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued and unpaid interest to,
but excluding, the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the applicable redemption
notice will state that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (i) on or promptly after
the date fixed for redemption or (ii) on such earlier payment date as selected by the Issuer.

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice.”

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject
to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any such
redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

**_Sinking Fund_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of any series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar (as
applicable) will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Clearstream
or Euroclear (as applicable), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary
requirements; provided, however, that no Note of EUR 100,000, in aggregate principal amount or less shall be
redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of EUR 1,000, will be redeemed, unless otherwise required
by law or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements. Neither the Trustee, the Paying
Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on the Notes or the part of the Notes called for
redemption. If any series of Notes is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that series
of Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive
Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any
Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of
the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, or an appropriate notation will be made on
such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof.
Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the
related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall
such date of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent,
except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is
issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), or such
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem any series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent) of the
relevant series of Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax

197


-----

**Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due**
on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under “—Withholding
_Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption_
or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the
next interest payment date in respect of such series of Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to such series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement
cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the
Payor; provided that changing the jurisdiction of the Issuer is not a reasonable measure for purposes of this section.
Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the
applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date,
such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply _mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such_
successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the
time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or delivery of any notice of redemption of any series of Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem
have been satisfied and that the Payor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that
the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The
Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as conclusive
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event
it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear
of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made by or on behalf of a Payor or
any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made
from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, including
payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received by the Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any
such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would
have been received by such Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account
of:

198


-----

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or withheld but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or the
beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership,
limited liability company or corporation or any Person other than the Holder to whom the Notes or any
amount payable thereon is attributable for the purposes of such Tax) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national
of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in,
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the
acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with any written request, made to that Holder or the Holder on behalf of that beneficial
owner in writing at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable, by the
Payor or applicable withholding agent: (a) to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or (b) to
make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which, in the case of (a) or (b) (or both), is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate
of deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of the
Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
permitted or required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment
to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had
the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer), plus solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) and
church tax (Kirchensteuer), if any, thereon, levied in Germany by a custodian bank or a disbursing agent
acting on behalf of the Holder;

(6) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to the Defence against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur
_Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze) as_
amended from time to time;

(7) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(8) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment to an individual pursuant to the
Finnish Prepayment Tax Act (20.12.1996/1118, as amended);

(9) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(10) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official
interpretations thereof, any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or official practices adopted pursuant to
an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to
the foregoing sections of the Code or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code; or

(11) any combination of the items (1) through (10) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who not the beneficial owner of the
Notes, to the extent that the sole beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such

199


-----

partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary,
settler, member or beneficial owner directly held such Notes.

Each Holder entitled to any Additional Amounts shall cooperate with the Issuer and the Trustee in providing any
information or documentation reasonably requested by the Issuer or the Trustee to confirm the identity and/or tax
status of such Holder and any affected beneficial owner to the extent such information is readily available to the
Holder (to the extent necessary to establish such Holder’s entitlement to Additional Amounts) and to provide
reasonable assistance to the Issuer or Trustee in determining the applicable withholding tax rate and the amount
of Additional Amounts payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction in the minimum amount required by applicable
laws and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with
applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if,
notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts, such tax receipts are not obtained, certified copies of other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee.
Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and
the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such
Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary, without further inquiry, investigation,
independent verification or liability of any kind.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption price or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or
property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect
thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or
receipt of payments with respect to, any Notes or any Note Guarantee (other than in each case, (A) in connection
with a transfer of the Notes after this issuance of Notes or (B) to the extent that such stamp, issue, registration
court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes or similar charges or levies becomes
payable upon a voluntary registration made by the Holder if such registration is not required by any applicable
law or not necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation to the Notes, any Guarantees,
the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto) and limited solely
in the case of any such Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes
imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded from the obligation to pay Additional Amounts
by any of clauses (1) through (3) or clauses (5) through (10) above (or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by
a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a
Payor is organized, incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or
any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee)
is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of
_Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to EUR 100,000_
or integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; provided that Notes of EUR 100,000 or less
may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase
any series of Notes as described under this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has
unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series and given notice of redemption as
described under “—Optional Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or
waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of a series of Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied
or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the
“Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive
interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue
interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and
that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or a portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with an agent appointed for such purpose an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election,
who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been
accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account
of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount
of such Note from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence

201


-----

of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction
that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon
the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of
Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a
number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a
mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Revolving Facility.

Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would
constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a
default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon
a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0; and, (2) to the
extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 4.1 to 1.0; provided further, however,
that Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may only Incur Indebtedness under this paragraph in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed, together with any Indebtedness Incurred by any
Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors under clause (11) of the second paragraph of this covenant, the
greater of (x) EUR 50 million and (y) 30% of Consolidated EBITDA.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (“Permitted
**Debt”):**

202


-----

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a
maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) EUR 110 million, plus
(ii) the greater of EUR 40 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA, _plus_ (iii) in the case of any
refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection
with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred by another
provision of this covenant; _provided_ that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to the
Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to the Notes or such Note Guarantee
to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; or (b) without limiting the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to
such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such debt is
subordinated to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the related Note
Guarantees;

(b) any Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness Incurred
under the Revolving Facility or Indebtedness described in clauses (3) or (4)(a) of this paragraph)
outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Existing
Notes until such Existing Notes are repaid pursuant to the Transactions;

(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clause (4) (other
than the Existing Notes) and clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant; and

(d) Management Advances.

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (i) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to
any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or

that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under
the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the fourth paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur
Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall
be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the extent the Issuer

_provided, however, that Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors may only Incur Indebtedness under clause_
(11) of this paragraph in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed, together with any
Indebtedness Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors under the first paragraph of this
covenant, the greater of (x) EUR 50 million and (y) 30% of Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described
in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may
from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the
first paragraph of this covenant;

205


-----

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Facility on the Issue Date shall be deemed initially
Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause
(4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to the first or second paragraph
above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA,” Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured at
the option of the Issuer on the date on which a new commitment is obtained or the date on which new
Indebtedness is Incurred or otherwise in compliance with the covenant described under the caption “—
_Financial Calculations,” provided that if the Issuer elects to have such determination occur on the date_
on which a new commitment is obtained, such Indebtedness shall be deemed to have occurred on the
date of such new commitment and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or
ratios under the Indenture (except to the extent such commitment is with respect to undrawn amounts
under a revolving credit facility or such commitment is subsequently canceled), including, for the
avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio and for purposes of
determining compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens”;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance or replace Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing or replacement Indebtedness would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA
restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of
such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance,
costs and fees in connection with such refinancing.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of
any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness
issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of
any other Indebtedness. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” provisions
or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid daily (or
otherwise periodically), including any revolving indebtedness, shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant
to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent
reborrowing thereof.

206


-----

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any EUR-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the EUR Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred
or first committed (whichever yields the lower EUR Equivalent); provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than EUR, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable EUR-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such EUR-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth
in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the EUR-Equivalent of the principal amount of
any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is
subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the EUR) covering principal amounts payable on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in EUR will be adjusted to take into account the effect
of such agreement.

In respect of any four full fiscal quarter period, exchange rates used in relation to an item of Indebtedness may be,
at the election of Issuer, (i) the weighted average exchange rates for that period, (ii) the exchange rate used in the
relevant financial statements as of the last day of such period, (iii) the exchange rate as in effect on the date that
Indebtedness was incurred or deemed incurred or (iv) the exchange rate on the Issue Date; provided _that, where_
applicable and at the election of the Issuer, any amount of Indebtedness will be stated so as to take into account
the hedging effect of any currency hedging entered into in respect of or by reference to that Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire
for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any

defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase,
repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred

(each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein as a “Restricted
**Payment”), if at the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:**

(a) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately
thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional EUR 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of
the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving
effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made
subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments
permitted below by clauses (5), (10) or (17) of the second succeeding paragraph, but excluding
all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph) would exceed the
sum of (without duplication):

Payment for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available
(if positive);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable

accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable

Payment has been made from such proceeds in reliance on clauses (1) or (6) of the
second succeeding paragraph, and (y) Excluded Contributions or Parent Debt
Contributions;

market value of any property or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or

Subsidiary that constituted a Permitted Investment made pursuant to clause (11) of the
definition of “Permitted Investment”; and

clauses (iv), (v) or (vi).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts (such amounts, the “Excluded Amounts”) that would otherwise be
included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to sub-clause (ii) of the
preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds
or property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that
would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the definition thereof, (2) the purpose, or effect of,
the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event
that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or
marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in accordance with the requirements of the
Indenture.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the fair

Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated
Preference Shares, an Excluded Contribution or an Excluded Amount), Subordinated Shareholder
Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through an Excluded Contribution, an Excluded

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall
be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) (i) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, (ii) meets the criteria of more than one of
the categories of Permitted Payments described in the fourth paragraph of this covenant, or (iii) constitutes a
Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion
thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such
reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer
to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether
owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom,
which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or
asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted
Liens if the Notes (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of Guarantors) and the Indenture are directly secured,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect

212


-----

to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is
so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction. The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Facility) and
any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date, (b) the
Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or any
related security documents or (c) any other agreement or instrument with respect to the Issuer or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case, in effect on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than
Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such
transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another
Person is the Successor Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary
thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or
assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews, refinances
or replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or
this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided,
_however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in_
any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a
whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements

213


-----

to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or
assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of

that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (A) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Facility,
together with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case,
as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or (B) the Issuer determines that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Qualified Receivables Financing;

to non-wholly owned Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition is not less
than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such
Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash (including any net cash proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such
Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
recorded on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the
date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the
Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness
as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second paragraph of
this covenant;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons
who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness
(i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, and (ii) is not Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any time outstanding, not to exceed
the greater of EUR 30 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of
each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (g) of this clause (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash of the Asset
Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; (ii) unless included in the preceding
clause (1)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any series of Notes and/or any other Indebtedness (other
than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that is
secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase
or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is
secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated

215


-----

Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary);

(2) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Notes, as the case may be, at a
purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that to the
extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to purchase any amount of the Notes at a price
not less than par, to the extent Holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the Issuer will
be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered, and such
amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if, after
giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(7) [reserved;]

(8) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(9) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1) through (6) of
this paragraph or a combination thereof; _provided_ that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a
permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x)
the date on which such investment is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess Proceeds.”
Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the
Indenture.

On the 366th day (or on the 546th day, in the case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to a
binding agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer pursuant to clause (8) of the
second preceding paragraph) after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of EUR 30 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA, the Issuer
will be required within 30 Business Days thereof to make an offer (an “Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders
and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured by a
Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes
and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid or purchased
out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any
such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and
100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum
denominations of EUR 100,000 and in integral multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable).

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use
any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders
and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such
Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in EUR, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their

216


-----

EUR Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period
(as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset
at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the relevant Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20
Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business
Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to
be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than
the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer
will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of EUR 100,000 and in integral
multiples of EUR 1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable). The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with
the terms of this covenant. The Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders of Notes the purchase price of Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the appropriate amounts of Notes from such
Holder’s account with Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable). Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed
or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of EUR 10
million and 5% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction, in each case, in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of EUR 15
million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions
have been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such transaction
complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the fourth_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitations on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment;

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,
or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or

party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that

beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such
_pro forma_ information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below);
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Issuer (or Holdco 2) will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of Holdco
2 as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and audited consolidated income statements and statements
of cash flow of Holdco 2 for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such

219


-----

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of Holdco 2,
beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2023, unaudited quarterly financial statements containing
the following information: (i) Holdco 2’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end
of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter
year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior
period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and (if
applicable) balance sheet information of Holdco 2, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates (provided that such pro forma financial
information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense or burden, in
which case the Issuer (or Holdco 2) will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company
financials); (iii) an operating and financial discussion of the unaudited financial statements, including a
discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, consolidated EBITDA and
material changes in liquidity and capital resources of Holdco 2; (iv) a discussion of material changes in

to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer or Holdco 2 announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer or
Holdco 2 and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer or
director changes at the Issuer or Holdco 2 or a change in auditors of the Issuer or Holdco 2, a report
containing a description of such event;

_provided, however, that in the event of any natural, medical, man-made or similar catastrophe which prevents or_
otherwise unduly restricts the Issuer (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) from furnishing the reports specified
in clauses (1) and (2) of this paragraph of this covenant within the time period set out therein, the Issuer shall have
the right to extend its reporting deadline up to 60 additional days after such reporting period deadline; provided,
_further, that the Issuer endeavors to provide such financial statements as soon as reasonably practicable._

The Issuer shall have the option at any time to provide the reports set forth in (1) and (2) above as if each reference
to the “Holdco 2” had been to the “Issuer,” or any of its successors or assigns, in which case subsections (1)(vii)
and (2)(vi) shall not apply.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the
Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities
Act.

The Issuer will make available such information and such reports to any Holder in each case by posting such
information on its website. In the event the Issuer posts copies of the reports specified in clauses (1), (2) and (3)
of the first paragraph of this covenant on its website, it will be deemed to have furnished such reports to the
Holders or to the extent that such information cannot be posted to the Issuer’s website for any reason, if such
information has been delivered to the Trustee.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such
report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the
periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer.
In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Issuer.

220


-----

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to post on its website reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as
to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Holders such
annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the
SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant by
providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of the Issuer (if such entity is different
from the Issuer) so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as
to content and time of delivery) of clause (1) and (2) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were
references to such Parent and (b) include condensed consolidated financial information together with a reasonably
detailed description of material differences between the financial condition and results of operations of such Parent
and the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be
deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Additionally, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent or IPO Entity
are listed on a Recognized Exchange and the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and
disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such Recognized Exchange,
for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Holders such annual reports, semi-annual reports
and/or quarterly reports that the Issuer or such Parent or IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with such
Recognized Exchange pursuant to the applicable admission and disclosure standards. Upon complying with the
foregoing requirements, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs; provided that if the consolidated financial statements of any Parent or the IPO Entity (if different than
the Issuer) are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the
financial condition and results of operations of such Parent or the IPO Entity and the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall be included.

Delivery of information, documents and reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s
receipt thereof shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein, or
determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants
under the Indenture or documents related thereto.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
**Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European**
Union, the United Kingdom, any State of the United States of America or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, Japan, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not
the Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee,
all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and (b) (in each case subject to any
limitation contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) all obligations of the Issuer under the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as
applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

221


-----

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Company would
be able to Incur at least an additional EUR 1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Issuer or the Successor Company for the most recently ended four full fiscal
quarters for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which the
transaction is consummated would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to
the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any is required
in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company; _provided_ that in giving an
Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Person that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any
Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and assets,
if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the predecessor company
will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety
or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and
the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered to the Trustee) and
all obligations of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2) immediately after giving effect
to the transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted
by the Indenture;

_provided however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall not apply to the extent that compliance_
with clauses (A) and (B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations,

222


-----

corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules,
guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable
jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that
is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i)
any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part
of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its
properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule,
regulation or order, recommendation or directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into
any Guarantor; provided that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant
Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading
“—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (v) a Permitted Reorganization or the solvent liquidation of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (vi) the Migration or (vii) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating
into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such
entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clauses (3)(A) and
(3)(B) under the heading “—The Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such
time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of
the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable
to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the Reversion
Date. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the
Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The covenant described under “—Limitation _on_
_Restricted Payments” will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during_
the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance

223


-----

of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer_
or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any
date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were
entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment
Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under
this caption have been satisfied; provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the
covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve
or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood, subject to the paragraph below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interests with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders
and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens,
(ii) the Collateral may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, discharged and released in
accordance with the Indenture and the applicable Security Documents, or in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended
from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein; (iv)
the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, discharge and release
security interests with respect to the Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted
Reorganization and/or the Migration and (v) the security interests in the Collateral and the related Security
Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); _provided,_
_however, that in the case of clauses (i) and (v) above, except with respect to any discharge or release in accordance_
with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Incurrence of
Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such
action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor
confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
(2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, which confirms the solvency of the person
granting such security interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, confirming
that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of
this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction, as applicable) consent to such amendments, extensions,
renewals, restatements, releases, supplements, modifications or replacements without the need for instructions
from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Facility, any Credit
Facility with an aggregate principal amount in excess of EUR 15 million or any other Public Debt, in each case,
of the Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10
Business Days after the date on which such Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the
Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted

224


-----

Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee; _provided, however,_ that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be
obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note Guarantee is
contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of
any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes, including any Swiss withholding taxes;
_provided, that in the case of Swiss withholding taxes, the Issuer has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain_
a ruling providing that no withholding taxes on interest payments are payable under the applicable Note
Guarantee) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may
contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Releases of the
_Note Guarantees.” A Note Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at_
the date of such release either (1) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after
the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had
not been designated as a Guarantor or (2) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was
Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as of the
date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as of that date. The Trustee and the
Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee
in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified
and/or secured to its satisfaction, as applicable.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral and the liability
of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing_
clause (1), the Issuer, Holdco 2, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and, if applicable, the Security
Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an
intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including substantially the same terms with
respect to release of Note Guarantees and priority and release of the security interests in the Collateral; provided
that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement
to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase
the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement
or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in
right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal
and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens,
(7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any
material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely
absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel.

225


-----

The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
“—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities
or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant_
described under “—Limitation on Restricted _Payments” and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any_
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
authorized and directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made
available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the
registered office of the Issuer.

**Financial Calculations**

When determining the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture in connection with any transaction
or whether any transaction is permitted under the Indenture (including without limitation, testing any Incurrence
or assumption of Indebtedness or Liens, the making of Restricted Payments, Permitted Payments or Investments,
any Asset Disposition, any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, consolidation, amalgamation, or other
business combination or change of control), the date of determination of such basket or ratio or the testing of any
such transaction and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be (A) the date of
consummation of the relevant transaction, (B) the date that any definitive agreement, put option or similar
arrangement in respect of such transaction is entered into, (C) the date that any unilateral commitment or binding
offer with respect to such transaction is made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or (D) the date that any
notice, which may be revocable or conditional, of any repayment, repurchase or refinancing of any Indebtedness
is given to the holders thereof.

In connection with such election, such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to such transaction and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence
of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference
period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such transaction. For the avoidance of doubt,
(x) if any of such baskets, ratios or permissions are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket, ratio or
permission (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA) subsequent to such date of determination and
at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such baskets, ratios or permissions will not be deemed
to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions
are permitted hereunder and (y) any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof and the fixing of any exchange rates) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date elected
pursuant to the prior paragraph and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets, ratios or
permissions under the Indenture (except in respect of any undrawn commitment in respect of a revolving credit
facility and except to the extent such transaction is subsequently abandoned); provided, that the Consolidated Net
Income of the Issuer (and any other financial term derived therefrom), other than for purposes of calculating any

227


-----

baskets, ratios or permissions in connection with the specified transaction, shall not include any Consolidated Net
Income of or attributable to a target company until the closing of such transaction shall have actually occurred.

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if (x) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a_
portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket
and (y) at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based basket, unless otherwise elected by
the Issuer, such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to
such ratio-based basket.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the
Holders (with a copy to the Trustee if given by the Holders) of at least 30% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries),
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal on such Indebtedness at stated final maturity (upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness) (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
**acceleration provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to EUR
25 million;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Issuer), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of EUR 25 million (exclusive of any amounts
for which a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability), which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default
**provision”);**

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral having a fair market
value in excess of EUR 10 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations
under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable, and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

228


-----

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations
under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer
(with a copy to the Trustee if given by the Holders) in writing of the default and, with respect to clauses (4) and
(6) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4) or (6), as applicable, of this
paragraph after receipt of such notice.

Notwithstanding the above, the Migration and the transactions related thereto shall not under any circumstances
result in a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee, by written notice to the Issuer, or, the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes under the Indenture, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of
such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes
under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and
unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes
because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under the definition of “—Events of Default” has occurred
and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default
or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived
by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment
of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the
Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except
as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to
the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with
respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture
at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the
Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing
to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and
the offer of such security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

229


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee
or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the
degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse
to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial
to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action
under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or other security satisfactory to it in its
sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence
of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of
such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give written notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days
after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if
any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that
withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection
with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure
to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed
in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant
to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required
by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed
period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take
certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take
action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is duly complying with
its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or
Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); _provided that if any amendment, supplement,_
other modification or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive one series of the Notes, only the consent of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However,
without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes
affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder or, if any
amendment, waiver or other modification will only amend, supplement, modify or waive one series of the Notes,
without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of
such series of Notes affected, with respect to any Notes of such series held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

230


-----

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may
be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to
such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes
in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note Guarantees or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect
under the Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer
of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Limitation on Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of_
the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect
thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or
amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes;

231


-----

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or security agent pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Facility Agreement,
in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Revolving Facility Agreement (as in
effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is
required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; _provided_ that the granting of such security interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied
with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely conclusively on such
evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the
Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any
Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to
any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such
Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of any series of Notes
have taken action under the Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes will be deemed to
be the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes as of (i) the record date in respect of such
action (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action) or (ii) the date the taking of such
action by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of such Notes has been certified to the Trustee by
the Issuer (of no such record date has been set).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by
clause (3) or (6) of the second preceding paragraph to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be
necessary for the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly
authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other
amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and the Trustee.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any direction,
waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled
by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be
outstanding; provided that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes of a series,
any Note Guarantees and the Indenture with respect to the Holders of such series in their capacity as such (“legal
**defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default with respect to such series, except for**
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities
and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes of such series, registration of Notes of such series, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes of such series and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents
and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in effect at such time will terminate with respect to the Notes of the applicable series (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and any future Guarantors under
the covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such_

232


-----

covenants described under “Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default,
the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to any Significant Subsidiaries, the
judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “—Events
_of Default” (“covenant defeasance”)._

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option with respect to a series of Notes,
payment of such Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to a series of Notes, payment of such Notes may not
be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and
(2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5)
(with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer and reasonably acceptable to
the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the applicable series
of Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including
delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant series of Notes will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a
ruling received by the Issuer from, or published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or based on a
change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with
either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except
as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture)
as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than
certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made
and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation;
or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable,
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer for this purpose),
cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in
an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the
Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of
Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3)
the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered
irrevocable instructions to the Trustee (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer for this
purpose) under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be (subject to the next succeeding sentence) and (5) the Issuer has delivered to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not be an
employee of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction

233


-----

_and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been_
complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including
as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested by the Issuer in writing to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent (which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the
above referenced Officer’s Certificate) no later than five business days prior to such distribution, the Trustee (or
such other entity directed, designated or appointed by the Issuer for this purpose) shall distribute any amount
deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the
avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth
above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost or any additional premium on
such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a global note deposited with a depositary for a clearing
system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of such clearing system will be
subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
such, shall have any liability for any obligation of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents, or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a
Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the
Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the
view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, of which the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an
Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use
the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of
the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer,
to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim
as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any Agent will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes
incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the
Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee. Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become
effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or expenses
Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices, warnings, summons and other communications to the Holders of the Notes from the Trustee shall be sent
via Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) with a copy to the Issuer and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (to
the extent required by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange). Any such notice or communication shall be
deemed to be given or made when sent from the Trustee. The Issuer’s written notifications to the holders of Notes
shall be sent through Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) with a copy to the Trustee and the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange (to the extent required by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange).

234


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will
be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the
Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of EUR-Denominated Restrictions**

The EUR is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors, if
any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees including damages. Any amount received or
recovered in a currency other than EUR (in the case of the Notes), whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or
otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the EUR
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on
the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date
on which it is practicable to do so).

If that EUR amount is less than the EUR amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee
as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision,
it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in
making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s
and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities
set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any EUR
denominated restriction herein, the EUR Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a currency
other than EUR shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-EUR amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange will be approved and settlement of such Notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than the U.S. Guarantors) are
located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor
(other than the U.S. Guarantors), including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not
be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes, the
Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts
in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of
the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

235


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of articles 470-1 to 470-19 of the Luxembourg act dated 10 August
1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Act 1915”), are excluded. No
Holder may initiate proceedings against the Issuer based on article 470-21 of the Luxembourg Companies Act
1915.

anticipated expense and cost reductions and other run rate synergies, to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee,
repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds

accounting or financial officer of the Issuer and may include anticipated expense and cost reductions and
other run rate synergies) as if they had occurred on the first day of the reference period; provided that no
adjustments shall be made pursuant to this clause (1) to the extent duplicative of adjustments that are
included in the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” or included pursuant to any other clause of this
definition;

determined in accordance with IFRS, and any operation, business or group of assets constituting a
business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date,

any such disposal, as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the
Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance
with IFRS, and any operation, business or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a
Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period; and

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness will be
calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period

adjustments as are consistent with the _pro forma_ provisions set forth in the definition of Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio; provided, however, that, any pro forma calculation shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness
Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the discharge on the Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the_

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Global Notes”). Each series of Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under
the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global
**Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the**
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in
their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, the Notes will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by
Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered
in their name, will not have received physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered
the registered owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as
applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must
rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any
aspect of the records, or for payments made relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder
of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or
more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect
of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents or
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes, each of Euroclear and

Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive
registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive
Registered Notes to their participants.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture.

270


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or
causes to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the
owner who made the initial request.

In such an event described in clauses (1) and (2), the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered
in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear,
Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not
required by the Indenture or applicable law.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent
appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the
Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the
Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss
which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for expenses in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by an Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture,
the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such
Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

To the extent permitted by law, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Registrar, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or their
respective nominees, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note
from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable
in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of its
Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be
redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn make
said payments to or to the order of the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear
and/or Clearstream will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective customary
procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except
as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.” If any such
deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes” above, the Issuer will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts_

271


-----

received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding
will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global
Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of
Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, each of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agent and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or
Clearstream (or their respective nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agent and the Paying Agent or any of their agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records
of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account
of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require
physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in
the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with

Through and including the 40th day after the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the issue date
of the Notes, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws
of any other jurisdiction. After the expiration of such 40-day period, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest without compliance
with these certification requirements.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the relevant Rule 144A
Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as
described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first

272


-----

delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement
system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations
or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions
between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration,
clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream
interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such
as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect
access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly
or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to
transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only
through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Securities Official List of the LuxSE.
The Notes have been accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The international
securities identification numbers and common code numbers for the Notes are set out under “Listing and General
_Information—Clearing Information.” Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear_
or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any
time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry
Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business
day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

273


-----

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in same day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement
can be made on the desired value date.

**TAXATION**

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

_The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and disposal_
_of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be_
_relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances_
_that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force_
_and as applied on the date of this Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive_
_or retrospective effect._

_As each series of Notes may be subject to a different tax treatment due to the specific terms of such series of Notes,_
_the following section only provides some general information on the possible tax treatment. Tax consequences_
_that may arise if an investor combines certain series of Notes so that he or she derives a certain return are not_
_discussed herein._

_The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate for certain investment income. However, prospective_
_purchasers of the Notes should be aware that (i) the tax treatment of payments in respect of the Notes may be_
_different (and in some cases significantly different) from that set out below, and (ii) tax laws and regulations and_
_their application or interpretation by the relevant taxation authorities or courts may change from time to time_
_(including the Flat Tax Regime described below which has submitted as unconstitutional by a fiscal court to the_
_Federal Constitutional Court for review). Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the precise tax treatment of the_
_Notes which will apply to a particular investor at any given time._

**_PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX_**
**_ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSAL_**
**_OF THE NOTES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR CHURCH TAXES, UNDER_**
**_THE TAX LAWS OF GERMANY AND ANY COUNTRY OF WHICH THEY ARE RESIDENT OR WHOSE_**
**_TAX LAWS APPLY TO THEM FOR OTHER REASONS._**

**_Withholding Tax_**

For German tax residents (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective
management and control is located in Germany), interest payments will be subject to German withholding tax if
the Notes are kept or administered (i) in a custodial account with a German branch of a German or non-German
credit or financial services institution or a German securities institution or (ii) following the Migration (see
“Corporate Structure” and “Certain Financing Arrangements”) – if no German branch of a German or
non-German credit or financial services institution or a German securities institution is the Disbursing Agent – by
the Issuer (each, a “Disbursing Agent,” auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity
surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%; with respect to the solidarity surcharge
see “Partial _Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge”). For individual holders of the Notes who are subject to church_
tax, an electronic information system for church withholding tax purposes applies in relation to investment
income, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless
the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office
(Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the holders will be assessed for church tax. Further, church tax is
not collected by way of withholding if the investment income forms part of income from trade business, selfemployment, agriculture and forestry, or letting and leasing.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest”,
_Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period_
provided that the Notes have been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent
since the time of their acquisition. If similar Notes kept or administered in the same custodial account were
acquired at different points in time, the Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold first for the purposes
of determining the capital gains. Where Notes are acquired and/or sold or redeemed in a currency other than Euro,
the sales/redemption price and the acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the foreign
exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and the acquisition date respectively with the result that
any currency gains or losses are part of the capital gains. If interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e. without
the Notes), the proceeds from the disposal are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the
collection of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately.

275


-----

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing
Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding
tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless
the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the
previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank, financial services or securities institution within the
European Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries (e.g., Switzerland or Andorra). If the
withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis
of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may,
and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must, also apply for an assessment on the
basis of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the
withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing
Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares in stock corporations and forward
transactions). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid
separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment
income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the
Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the
Disbursing Agent will take up to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene
_Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross_
payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has
submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by
the competent tax authorities.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case
may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been
evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments,
are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may
apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject
to further requirements being met.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the
solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined
below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are held or
administered in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain
circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax
treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

In case of Definitive Registered Notes, payments might be also subject to German withholding tax if the Notes
are presented for an over-the-counter-payment to a Disbursing Agent.

Furthermore, payments made by a Guarantor resident in Germany or – following the Migration (see “Corporate
_Structure and Certain Financing Arrangements”) – by the Issuer to a holder resident in a so-called “non-_
cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) may be subject to a tax deduction in Germany
at a rate of 15% (plus solidarity surcharge) of the gross payment pursuant to the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion
and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb).
However, according to recently introduced legislation no withholding tax will be levied if bearer notes are
represented by a global note (Sammelurkunde), are held in collective safe custody with a central depositary, and
are tradable on a recognized stock exchange.

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in
Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church
tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen).
Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance
(Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered
partnership law filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital
investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from capital
investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “—Withholding
_Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody_
abroad or of no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax on disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the
actual gain, which exceeds 30% of the disposal proceeds), the individual holder must include its interest income
and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus
solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a
taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax
with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction
costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted.

Capital losses from the Notes held as private assets are tax-recognised irrespective of the holding period of the
Notes. The losses may, however, not be used to offset other income like employment or business income but may
only be offset against investment income subject to certain limitations. Losses not utilised in one year may be
carried forward into subsequent years but may not be carried back into preceding years. According to new
legislation, capital losses of private investors resulting from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a
receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or if the Notes expire worthless can only be offset against income derived from
capital investments up to an amount of EUR 20,000.00 per annum (“Limitation on Loss Deduction”). Losses
exceeding that threshold can be carried forward and set-off against income derived from capital investments up
to an amount of EUR 20,000.00 per annum in subsequent years, subject to certain requirements. Given that the
Limitation on Loss Deduction will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent (as defined above) holding
the Notes in custody, holders suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required
to declare such losses in their income tax return.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business or the income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting
and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not settle the personal or corporate income tax liability.
Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where
applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and
capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include income and related
(business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate.
Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax
liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded.
Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax
liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) applicable to the investor. If the
holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or
partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

_Non-Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not located in
Germany).

277


-----

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in Germany are generally not subject to
German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including
a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder, (ii) the holder of the Note is tax
resident in a non-cooperative jurisdiction as determined pursuant to the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and
Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb), payment is
made by a Guarantor resident in Germany or – following the Migration (see “Corporate Structure and Certain
_Financing Arrangements”) – the Issuer and the above mentioned exemption (as described under “—Withholding_
_Tax” above) does not apply or (iii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income from_
the letting and leasing of certain German-situs real estate or income from capital investments directly or indirectly
secured by German-situs real estate (or other assets that are from a German civil law perspective treated as real
estate), unless the Notes qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German
Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). In cases
(i) and (iii) a tax regime similar to that explained above under “—Tax Residents” applies. Furthermore, the holders
who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the
proceeds by way of an over the counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in
custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements, a holder who is not tax resident
in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable double taxation treaty
(Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift tax if
the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or deemed to
be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany
at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless the Notes are attributable to a
German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has
been appointed in Germany or the obligations under the Notes are directly or indirectly secured by German-situs
real estate (unless the Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)).
Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who previously maintained a residence in Germany.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the issuance,
delivery or execution of the Notes. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**Partial Abolishment of Solidary Surcharge**

The solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished as of the assessment period 2021 for certain individuals. The
solidarity surcharge shall, however, continue to apply for investment income and, thus, on withholding taxes
levied. In case the individual income tax burden for a private investor of Notes tax resident in Germany is lower
than 25% such holder can apply for his/her investment income being assessed at his/her individual tariff-based
income tax rate in which case solidarity surcharge would be refunded.

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT)**

The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax
(“FTT”) in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.
However, Estonia has meanwhile stated that it will not participate. The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and
could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market
transactions) in certain circumstances.

Pursuant to the current proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside
of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (“Participating
**Member States”). Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial**
institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or
be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (i)
by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (ii) where the financial instrument
which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States with respect to the
exact wording and timing. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains

278


-----

unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Besides the proposed FTT, some jurisdictions
(e.g., Italy and France) have already introduced a domestic financial transaction tax that may apply to certain
dealings in the Securities in certain circumstances. Other jurisdictions may also introduce a domestic financial
transaction tax.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following information is of a general nature only and is based on the laws presently in force in Luxembourg,
though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. Prospective investors in the
Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws,
including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg
income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a withholding tax or a tax of a
similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only.

_Withholding tax_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, and subject to the exception below, interest payments
(including accrued but unpaid interest) and principal repayments made to non-residents of Luxembourg in the
context of the holding, disposal, redemption or repurchase of the Notes which are not profit-sharing will not be
subject to any Luxembourg withholding tax, and the Issuer is not under any obligation to pay any additional
amounts as a consequences of any withholding.

As regards Luxembourg resident individuals, the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, as amended, (the
“Relibi Law”) provides for a 20% withholding tax (which is final when Luxembourg resident individuals are
acting in the context of the management of their private wealth) on savings income, to the extent such income is
paid or allocated by a Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of this law.

Under the Relibi Law, payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in
Luxembourg to an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding
tax of 20%. Payments of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law will be subject to a
withholding tax at a rate of 20%.

Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Relibi Law is assumed by the Luxembourg paying
agent.

_Other Taxes and Duties_

Under current Luxembourg tax law and current administrative practice, it is not necessary that the Notes be
notarized, filed, recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in Luxembourg, or that any stamp, transfer,
capital, registration or similar tax be paid on or in relation to the execution and delivery of the Notes in accordance
therewith or the performance of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, unless the documents relating to the
Notes are (i) physically appended to any document that requires mandatory registration in the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg, or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire), or
(iii) registered on a voluntary basis.

_VAT_

There is no Luxembourg value-added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the
Notes or in respect of the payment of a redemption amount or principal under the Notes or the transfer of a Note;
provided that Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain
services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are rendered, or are
deemed to be rendered, in Luxembourg and an exemption from value added tax does not apply with respect to
such services.

279


-----

_Net Wealth tax_

Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on holders of the Notes unless:

(i) Such corporate holder of Notes is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for the purpose of the
relevant provisions and with the exception of the following entities that are net wealth tax exempt, being
(i) undertakings for collective investment (UCITS) within the meaning of the law of December 17, 2010
as amended, (ii) investment company in risk capital (SICAR) within the meaning of the law dated June
15, 2004, as amended, (iii) securitization entities within the meaning of the law dated March 22, 2004 as
amended, (iv) specialized investment funds (SIF) within the meaning of the law of February 13, 2007, as
amended, (v) private wealth management companies (SPF) within the meaning of the law dated May 11,
2007 as amended and (vi) reserved alternative investment funds (RAIF) within the meaning of the law
dated July 23, 2016, as amended; or

(ii) The relevant Note is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a permanent
establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg;

However, a securitization company subject to the amended law of March 22, 2004 and a company subject to the
amended law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles, are as from January 1, 2016, subject to a minimum net
wealth tax, as well as, RAIF subject to the law of July 23, 2016, as amended, provided it is foreseen in the
incorporation documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and that (ii) article 48 of the
aforementioned law of July 23, 2016, as amended applies.

The Relibi Law has abrogated the net wealth tax for Luxembourg resident individuals.

_Taxation of the Noteholders_

A holder of Notes who derives income from such Note or who realizes a gain on the disposal or redemption
thereof will not be subject to Luxembourg taxation on such income or capital gains realized on the sale or disposal,
in any form whatsoever, of the Notes (subject to the application of the Relibi Law) unless:

(i) Such holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for Luxembourg tax purposes (or for the
purposes of the relevant provisions); or

(ii) Such income or gain is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a
permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg.

(iii) Except if, such holder is a corporate holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 on SPF,
as amended, or by the law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended,
or by the law of February 13, 2007 on specialized investment funds, as amended, or by the law of July
23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds (provided it is not foreseen in the incorporation
documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and that (ii) article 48 of the
aforementioned law of July 23, 2016 applies).

A corporate Luxembourg resident holder of Notes must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption
premium or issue discount, as well as any gain realised on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the
Notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

A corporate holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 on SPF, as amended, or by the law of
December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended, or by the law of February 13, 2007
on specialized investment funds, as amended, or by the law of July 23, 2016, as amended, on reserved alternative
investment funds (provided it is not foreseen in the incorporation documents that (i) the exclusive object is the
investment in risk capital and that (ii) article 48 of the aforementioned law of July 23, 2016, as amended, applies)
is exempt from income tax in Luxembourg and thus income derived from the Notes, as well as gains realized
thereon, are not subject to Luxembourg income taxes.

A non-resident corporate holder of Notes or an individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management
of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent establishment or permanent representative in
Luxembourg to which or to whom such Notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest
accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any gains realised upon the
sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

280


-----

A Luxembourg resident individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private
wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest received, redemption
premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes, except if (i) withholding tax has been levied on such payments in
accordance with the Relibi Law, or (ii) the Luxembourg resident individual holder of the Notes has opted for the
application of a 20% tax in full discharge of income tax in accordance with the Relibi Law, which applies if a
payment of interest has been made or ascribed by a paying agent established in a EU Member State (other than
Luxembourg), or in a Member State of the European Economic Area (other than a EU Member State). A gain
realised by a Luxembourg resident individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her
private wealth, upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income
tax, provided this sale or disposal took place more than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any
portion of such gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax,
except if tax has been levied on such interest in accordance with the Relibi Law.

A Luxembourg resident individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or
business undertaking must include this interest in its taxable basis. If applicable, the tax levied in accordance with
the Relibi Law will be credited against his/her final tax liability.

_Common Reporting Standard_

The OECD has developed a new global standard for the annual automatic exchange of financial information
between tax authorities (the “CRS”). The CRS has been implemented in Luxembourg via the law dated
December 18, 2015 concerning the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts and tax matters and
implementing EU Directive 2014/107/EU and amending EU Directive 2011/16/EU (the “CRS Law”). In addition,
the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement (“Multilateral
**Agreement”) to automatically exchange information under the CRS.**

The CRS requires specified financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which may
include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due diligence
procedures. A jurisdiction that has signed the Multilateral Agreement may provide this information to other
jurisdictions that have signed the Multilateral Agreement. Consequently, holders of Notes may be requested to
provide certain information and certifications to any financial institutions through which the payments on the
Notes are made.

Each prospective investor and each holder of Notes should consult its own tax advisors regarding the requirements
under CRS with respect to its own situation as well as the determination of its tax residence.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of
purchasing, holding and disposing of Notes. This discussion is limited to U.S. federal income tax considerations
relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of Additional Notes (as defined below) and
does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate
and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”),
and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance
that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or
disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder
in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare
contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates,
insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities or
currencies, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities or arrangements and investors
in such entities, holders of Existing Notes redeemed in connection with this offering, persons liable for alternative
minimum tax, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the
United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”, “conversion transaction” or other
integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting

281


-----

rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable
financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original
issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., with respect to a particular series of the Notes, the first price at which a
substantial amount of Notes of such series is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers
or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and
who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity
taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of
the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the
U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a
partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of**
**holding the Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal**
**income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state, local, foreign**
**or other tax laws.**

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances (see, e.g., “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the
_Notes—Change of Control”), we may be obligated to make payments on a series of the Notes in excess of stated_
principal and interest or purchase all or a portion of a series of the Notes before the maturity date. We intend to
take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause such series of Notes to be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S.
holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such
payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the
IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and such series of Notes
were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders would be required to accrue interest income at
a rate higher than their yield to maturity, regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, to treat as ordinary
income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of a Note of
such series, and to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income in a manner
different than that described below. The remainder of this discussion assumes that neither series of the Notes will
be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences
thereof.

**_Effect of Pushdown Provisions_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under “Description of the
_Notes—Security—IPO Pushdown” or “Description of the Notes—Security—Debt Pushdown” or as contemplated_
by the definition of “Migration” as described in the “Description of Notes”, such change in the Issuer could result
in a deemed exchange of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S.
holders generally would recognize any gain on such exchange (although any loss could be disallowed), and the
Notes could be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue additional notes (“Additional Notes”) as described under “Description of the Notes.” These
Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series of the original series of
Notes in some cases, may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such a case, the
Additional Notes may be considered to have OID (or a greater amount of OID) which may adversely affect the

282


-----

market value of the original Notes of such series if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from
the original Notes.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes
and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder
as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a U.S. holder is subject to withholding taxes, such
U.S. holder should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of relief from withholding or a refund of
any withheld taxes under the U.S.-Luxembourg tax treaty.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar
value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received)
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder
will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may
recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise
is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an
accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating
such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that
spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An
accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the
spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of
an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has
made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the
date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S.
holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued
interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal
the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of
exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the
interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute
ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally
not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

Because the stated principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes will exceed their issue price by an amount equal
to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, the Floating Rate Notes will be treated as issued with
OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the amount of such excess. Accordingly, U.S. holders of Floating
Rate Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders of Floating Rate Notes generally
will include OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The amount of OID with respect to a Floating Rate Note includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the
“daily portions” of OID with respect to the Floating Rate Note for each day during the taxable year or portion
thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Floating Rate Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to
each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of
a Floating Rate Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Floating Rate Note,
provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest
occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any
accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Floating Rate Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning
of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity”, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each
accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable

283


-----

to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Floating Rate Note at the start of any accrual period generally
is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued unpaid OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity
of a Floating Rate Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and
interest payments to be made under the Floating Rate Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the
Note. For the purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest
and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes is a fixed rate based on the
value of the floating rate applicable to the Floating Rate Notes as of the issue date.

OID on Floating Rate Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars
in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of
_Stated Interest.”_

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the
disposition of a Floating Rate Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously
included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment
received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of
the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Floating Rate
Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Floating Rate Note; second, as receipt of
previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods
first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective
purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Floating Rate Notes
as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign
tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or
expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income on a Note (and OID on a Floating Rate Note) generally will constitute foreign source
income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable
to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S.
holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such
credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at
risk rules). Certain Treasury Regulations that apply to non-U.S. income taxes paid or accrued in taxable years
beginning on or after December 28, 2021 restrict the availability of any such credit based on the nature of the
withholding tax imposed by the non-U.S. jurisdiction. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors
regarding the creditability of any such tax imposed by Luxembourg. If a refund of any tax withheld is available
under any applicable income tax treaty, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such
credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (and will not be eligible for the deduction against
U.S. federal taxable income). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign
tax credits. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any
withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (less
any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed
above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder, increased,
in the case of a Floating Rate Note, by OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to the Note, if
any, translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third
paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will
generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of
purchase. If the Notes are considered to be traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder
is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below,
such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at
the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

284


-----

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency
translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. If the Notes are considered to be traded on an
established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will
determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange
on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to
the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all
debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis
U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the
extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain
or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note
generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or
expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal
is received from the Issuer or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s
foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder
purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with
respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, OID, which will be treated
as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount”, as applicable.
However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of an Note, a U.S. holder
will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued and unpaid stated
interest and, in the case of a Floating Rate Note accrued OID) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by
such U.S. holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note
in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source
gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including
individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates
of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency
with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign
currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest on the Notes (and Additional
Amounts, if any) and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a
Note paid to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required, provides evidence
of such exemption. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a correct
taxpayer identification number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to
comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses
in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a
foreign currency note. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure
obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886
(Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

285


-----

U.S. holders who are individuals and who own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in
excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to file an information
report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a U.S. holder does not file a required
IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment
and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close before the date
which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The Notes generally will constitute specified
foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain
financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these
rules.

U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS
THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR
IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN
INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.

**Certain Finnish Tax Consequences**

The following is a general discussion applicable to Finnish tax resident individuals and limited liability companies
with respect to certain Finnish tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and disposal of the Notes.

The summary covers only the tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and disposal of the Notes by individuals
who are tax residents of Finland and taxed in accordance with the Finnish Income Tax Act (Tuloverolaki)
(1535/1992, as amended) and by Finnish limited liability companies that are taxed in accordance with the Finnish
Business Income Tax Act (Laki _elinkeinotulon verottamisesta) (360/1968, as amended). It does not purport to be_
a comprehensive description of all Finnish tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the
Notes, and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular
purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Finland currently in force and as applied on the date of this
Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Prospective purchasers of
the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences (including tax reporting
obligations) of the acquisition, holding and disposal of the Notes under the tax laws of Finland and any country
of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

**_Withholding Tax and Preliminary Tax_**

On the basis that the Issuer is not resident in Finland for tax purposes and have no presence or permanent
establishment in Finland, there is no Finnish withholding tax (lähdevero) applicable on payments made by the
Issuer in respect of the Notes. However, Finland operates a system of preliminary taxation to secure payment of
taxes in certain circumstances. In the context of the Notes, a preliminary tax (ennakonpidätys) of 30 per cent will
generally be deducted and withheld from all payments that are treated as interest or as compensation comparable
to interest (such as secondary market compensation), when such payments are made by a Finnish paying agent or
intermediary to Finnish tax resident individuals. Such preliminary tax will be used for the payment of the
individual’s final taxes (which means that they are credited against the individual’s final tax liability).

Payment of redemption proceeds or interest on the Notes through a Finnish paying agent or intermediary to Finnish
limited liability companies will not be subject to any Finnish preliminary or withholding taxes.

**_Taxation of Interest_**

_Individuals_

Any interest and/or secondary market compensation (i.e., an amount corresponding to the interest accrued for the
period from the last interest payment date to the date of disposal of the Notes) paid on the Notes whilst they are
outstanding or upon redemption constitute capital income for the individual. All capital income of individuals is
currently taxed at a rate of 30 per cent or 34 per cent for capital income exceeding EUR 30,000 annually.

286


-----

_Corporate entities_

Any interest and/or secondary market compensation paid on the Notes whilst they are outstanding or upon
redemption would constitute part of a limited liability company’s taxable business income. A limited liability
company is subject to a corporate income tax, currently at the rate of 20 per cent for its worldwide taxable income.

**_Capital Gains Tax_**

_Individuals_

All capital income of individuals—including capital gains—is currently taxed at a rate of 30 per cent or 34 per
cent for capital income exceeding EUR 30,000 annually. Capital losses are primarily deductible from capital gains
arising in the same year. Any capital losses that cannot be used to offset capital gains in the same year can then
be applied against other capital income in the same year. Any remaining unused capital losses can finally be
carried forward for five years and used in the same manner as described above.

A gain arising from the disposal and/or redemption of the Notes constitutes a capital gain for individuals. Also,
any interest or secondary market compensation paid on the Notes upon disposal or redemption will be taxed as
described under “—Taxation of Interest” above. Losses arising from the disposal or redemption of the Notes
should qualify as a capital loss.

Capital gains arising from a disposal of assets, such as the Notes, are exempted from tax provided that the sales
prices of all assets sold by the individual during the calendar year do not, in the aggregate, exceed EUR 1,000.
Correspondingly, capital losses are not tax deductible if the acquisition cost of all assets disposed of during the
calendar year does not, in the aggregate, exceed EUR 1,000 and the aggregate sales prices do not exceed EUR
1,000.

_Corporate entities_

Any income received from a disposal and/or redemption of the Notes would, as a general rule, constitute part of
the limited liability company’s taxable business income. The acquisition cost of the Notes sold (including the
purchase price and costs) and any sales related expenses are generally deductible for tax purposes upon disposal
or redemption. Accordingly, any loss due to disposal or redemption of the Notes would generally be deductible
from the taxable business income.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or similar duties will be payable in Finland in connection with the issuance,
delivery or execution of the Notes.

No wealth tax is currently levied in Finland.

**Certain Swiss Tax Considerations**

_The following is a general discussion of certain tax consequences under the tax laws of the Switzerland of the_
_acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Notes. This discussion does not purport to be a comprehensive_
_description of all tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this_
_discussion does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This_
_summary is based on the laws of Switzerland currently in force and as applied on the date of this Offering_
_Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect. Prospective_
_purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the acquisition,_
_ownership and disposal of the Notes._

**_Withholding Tax_**

Payments by the Issuer of interest on, and repayment of principal of, the Notes will not be subject to Swiss federal
withholding tax, provided that the Issuer is at all times resident and managed outside Switzerland.

On 3 April 2020, the Swiss Federal Council published draft legislation and opened a consultation procedure
regarding the reform of the Swiss withholding tax regime. The draft legislation, if enacted in its current form,
would replace the current debtor-based regime applicable to interest payments with a paying agent-based regime
for Swiss withholding tax. In general terms, the proposed paying agent-based regime would (i) subject all interest

287


-----

payments made through paying agents in Switzerland to individuals resident in Switzerland to Swiss withholding
tax and (ii) exempt from Swiss withholding tax interest payments to all other persons, including to Swissdomiciled legal entities and foreign investors (other than for indirect interest payments via foreign and domestic
collective investments vehicles). However, the results of the consultation, which ended on 10 July 2020, were
controversial. Consequently, on 15 April 2021, the Swiss Federal Council submitted new draft legislation on the
reform of the Swiss withholding tax system providing for the abolition of Swiss withholding tax on interest
payments on bonds for submission to the Swiss Parliament, which legislation was accepted by the Swiss
Parliament on 17 December 2021. The proposed legislation has been rejected in a referendum held on 25
September 2022. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a new paying agent-based regime were nevertheless to be
enacted as contemplated by the draft legislation published on 3 April 2020 and were to result in the deduction or
withholding of Swiss withholding tax on any payment in respect of a Note by any person in Switzerland other
than the Issuer, the holder of such Note would not be entitled to any additional amounts with respect to such Note
as a result of such deduction or withholding.

**_Stamp Tax_**

The issue and redemption of the Notes by the Issuer is not subject to Swiss federal issuance stamp tax
(Emissionsabgabe).

Purchases or sales of Notes (with a maturity in excess of 12 months), where a Swiss domestic bank or a Swiss
domestic securities dealer (as defined in the Swiss federal stamp tax legislation) is a party, or acts as an
intermediary, to the transaction, may be subject to Swiss federal transfer stamp tax (Umsatzabgabe) at a rate of
up to 0.3% of the purchase price of the Notes. Where both, the seller and the purchaser, of the Notes are
non-residents of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein, no Swiss federal transfer stamp tax is payable.

**_Income Tax_**

_Notes held by non-Swiss holders_

Payments by the Issuer of interest and repayment of principal to, and gain realized on the sale or redemption of
the Notes by, a holder of Notes who is not a resident of Switzerland and who during the relevant taxation year has
not engaged in a trade or business through a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business in Switzerland
to which the Notes are attributable and who is not subject to income taxation in Switzerland for any other reason
will not be subject to any Swiss federal, cantonal or communal income tax.

_Notes held by Swiss holders as private assets (Privatvermögen)_

Individuals who are resident in Switzerland and who hold the Notes as private assets are required to include all
payments of interest on such Notes in their personal income tax return for the relevant tax period and will be
taxable on any net taxable income for such tax period. A capital gain, including a gain relating to interest accrued
realized on the sale or redemption of the Notes by such a Swiss resident holder, is a tax-free private capital gain,
and, conversely, a respective loss on the Notes is a non-tax-deductible private capital loss.

_Notes without a “predominant one-time interest payment”: In case of notes without a predominant onetime interest_
payment (the yield-to-maturity predominantly derives from periodic interest payments and not from a onetime
interest payment) interest payments (either in the form of periodic interest payments or as a
one-time-interest-payment such as an issue discount or a repayment premium) on such notes are taxable.

_Notes with a “predominant one-time interest payment”: In the case of notes with a “predominant one-time interest_
payment” (the yield-to-maturity predominantly derives from a one-time-interest-payment such as an original issue
discount or a repayment premium and not from periodic interest payments), the positive difference (including any
capital and foreign exchange gain) between the amount received upon sale or redemption and the issue price (if
the notes were purchased thereafter) will be classified as a taxable interest payment, and not a tax-free capital gain
(differential taxation method). Losses realized on the sale of notes with a “predominant onetime interest payment”
may be offset against gains realized within the same tax period on the sale of any notes with a “predominant
one-time interest payment”.

_Notes held as Swiss business assets (Geschäftsvermögen)_

Individuals who hold the Notes as part of their business in Switzerland and Swiss-resident corporate taxpayers
and corporate taxpayers residing abroad holding the Notes as part of a permanent establishment or fixed place of
business in Switzerland are in general taxed according to Swiss statutory accounting principles

288


-----

(Massgeblichkeitsprinzip) for purposes of Swiss federal, cantonal and municipal income taxes. Interest and capital
gains realized on the sale or redemption of the Notes are part of their taxable business profit and subject to Swiss
federal, cantonal and municipal income taxes. The same also applies to individuals who, for income tax purposes,
qualify as so-called professional securities dealers (gewerbsmässige Wertschriftenhändler).

**_Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters._**

The Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (“AEI”) is a global initiative led by the OECD. It aims
to establish a universal standard for automatic exchange of tax information and to increase tax transparency.
Jurisdictions that are committed to implement or have implemented the AEI (such as Switzerland, the European
Union member countries and many other jurisdictions worldwide) require their reporting financial institutions in
accordance with the respective local implementing law to determine the tax residence(s) of their account holders
and controlling persons (as applicable) and, in case of reportable accounts, report certain identification
information, account information and financial information (including the account balance and related payments
such as interest, dividends, other income and gross proceeds) to the local tax authority which will then exchange
the information received with the tax authorities in the relevant reportable jurisdictions.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)_**

Switzerland has concluded an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to facilitate the implementation
of FATCA. The agreement ensures that the accounts held by U.S. persons with Swiss financial institutions are
disclosed to the U.S. tax authorities either with the consent of the account holder or by means of group requests
within the scope of administrative assistance. Information will not be transferred automatically in the absence of
consent, and instead will be exchanged only within the scope of administrative assistance on the basis of the
double taxation agreement between the U.S. and Switzerland.

**Certain Other Tax Considerations**

**_Payment by a Guarantor_**

If a guarantor of the Notes makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes, it is possible that such payments
may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions
of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such
payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for exemption from withholding tax.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes by
employee benefit plans, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, that are subject to Title I of the United States
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, such as individual retirement
accounts, as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and entities
whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of such plans or accounts (within the meaning of
29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) (each, an “ERISA Plan”). Employee
benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined
in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) or other plans (together
with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) that are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may,
however, be subject to federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations that are substantially similar to such
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”). Any fiduciary of such a plan
considering an investment in the Notes should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any
exemptive relief under such laws or regulations.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit certain
transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA
and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an
ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment
advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered
to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in
accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other
applicable Similar Laws.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Security Agent,
the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Initial Purchasers or any of their
respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial
investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity,
with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials
from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at
any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the
Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each
prospective ERISA Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative
exemption is available.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, the
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties
and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes
by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person
may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section
4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class
or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction
rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of notes by a Plan, depending on the type and circumstances
of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such notes and the relationship of the party in interest or
disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section
4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Plan.

290


-----

In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”)
that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time
to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified
professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38
(respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting insurance company general accounts) and
PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers).

Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of a Plan that is
considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully
review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable.
There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available
with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any
Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

By acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and agreed
that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the Notes or an
interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan, or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition by such purchaser or
transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

Each purchaser and transferee of a Note that is, or is acting on behalf of, an ERISA Plan, will be further deemed
to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any investment
recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the
ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the
Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or
Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or Plan Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA Plan’s
acquisition of the Notes and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the
investment in the Notes.

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be
construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation,
administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this
discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date
of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon
persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other
persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan,
consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any
Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of
the Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any Transaction Party or any of their
respective representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the
Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. Each of the sales will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement
among the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to be dated the date of the final offering memorandum (the “Purchase
**Agreement”).**

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will
purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain
customary fees for their services in connection with this offering of the Notes and to reimburse them for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that appear on
the cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may change
the prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial
Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the
United States. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to
reject orders in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our
counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments
of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the offering may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers
may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose
of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or the
Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries or (subject to certain exceptions) affiliates that are substantially
similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement until the date falling 60 days after
the date of the final offering memorandum without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may
not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A
and to certain persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important
_Information” and “Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors”, “Notice to Certain European Investors” and “Notice to_
_Residents of Canada.”_

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

- has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section
21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which
section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and

- has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by
it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Luxembourg, Germany, Finland,
Switzerland, Canada and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering
of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material
relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes
may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering
material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country
or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction.
This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering
Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the

292


-----

offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to
_Prospective U.S. Investors”, “Notice to Certain European Investors” and “Notice to Residents of Canada.”_

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,
contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or the safe
harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will apply to list the
Notes on the Securities Official List of the LuxSE, however, the Issuer cannot assure you that the listing will be
obtained or, if obtained, maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable
law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition,
any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange
Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does
develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which
_case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be six business days (as such term is used for purposes
of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being
referred to as “T+ 6”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in two business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the following four business
days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit
bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed
in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a
broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering
transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing
Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining
the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the offering, creating a syndicate short
position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition,
the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable
laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market
price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to
engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to
the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—There may not
_be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher
than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date
on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may
cease at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end
no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment
of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial

293


-----

Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future
investment banking, financial advisory and lending and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates in
the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions.
The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing
conditions), which could affect future trading of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their
affiliates are lenders or act as agent under our New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement or are Cash
Management Providers under our Cash Management Facilities and may enter into hedging arrangements with us
in connection with the Transactions, and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities.
Moreover, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hold Existing Notes and/or act as lenders under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Upon redemption of the Existing Notes and repayment of the Existing
Revolving Credit Facility, such Initial Purchasers or their affiliates will receive a portion of the proceeds of this
offering.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours (including the Notes) or our
affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their
credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase
of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered
hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of the_
_Notes and the Notes Guarantees offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees are subject to restrictions on transfer as summarized below. By purchasing
Notes, you will be deemed to have made the following acknowledgments, representations to and agreements with
the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that:

(2) You acknowledge that this Offering Memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and may not comply in important
respects with SEC rules that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering of
securities.

(3) You represent that you are not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) of the
Issuer, that you are not acting on our behalf and that either:

(a) you are a QIB (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) and are purchasing Notes
for your own account or for the account of another QIB, and you are aware that the Initial
Purchasers are selling the Notes to you in reliance on Rule 144A; or

(b) you are purchasing Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

(4) You acknowledge that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers or any person
representing the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers has made any representation to you with
respect to the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Offering, other than the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum. Accordingly, you acknowledge that no representation or warranty is made by the Initial
Purchasers or any person representing the Initial Purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such
materials. You represent that you are relying only on this Offering Memorandum in making your
investment decision with respect to the Notes. You agree that you have had access to such financial and
other information concerning the Group and the Notes as you have deemed necessary in connection with
your decision to purchase Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request information
from the Group and the Initial Purchasers.

(5) You represent that you are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution of the Notes in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of
that investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their
ability to resell the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A or any other available exemption from registration under
the U.S. Securities Act. You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which
you are purchasing Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance of the Notes will
agree, that until the end of the Resale Restriction Period (as defined below), the Notes may be offered,
sold or otherwise transferred only:

(a) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiaries thereof;

(b) under a registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act;

295


-----

(c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale under Rule 144A, to a person the seller reasonably
believes is a QIB that is purchasing for its own account or for the account of another QIB and
to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A;

(d) through offers and sales that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act; and

(e) under any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act,

subject in each of the above cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s property
or the property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within the seller or account’s control
and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a global note, the
Resale Restriction Period (as defined below) may continue until one year after the Issuer, or any affiliate
of the Issuer, was the owner of such Note or an interest in such Global Note, and so may continue
indefinitely.

acquired by you except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar that the
restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(9) You acknowledge that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy
of the above acknowledgments, representations and agreements. You agree that if any of the
acknowledgments, representations or agreements you are deemed to have made by your purchase of
Notes are no longer accurate, you will promptly notify the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. If you are

that (i) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any investment recommendation or investment
advice on which you, or any fiduciary or other person investing your assets (“Plan Fiduciary”), has
relied as a primary basis in connection with your or its decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not
otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3)
of the Code, to you or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with your or its acquisition of the Notes and (ii)
the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are or will be limited liability companies or corporations established under the laws
of the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg, Finland, Switzerland or the United States.

The majority of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ directors, officers and other executives are expected to be neither
residents nor citizens of the United States. Furthermore, the majority of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ assets are
located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
within the United States upon such persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors or to enforce against them, the Issuer or
the Guarantors judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state
securities laws despite the fact that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the respective Issuer and the respective
Guarantors have appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York. It may be possible
for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon those persons or the Issuer or over the Issuer’s
respective subsidiaries provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have been advised by their German counsel, that there is doubt that a lawsuit based
upon U.S. federal or state securities laws could be brought in an original action in Germany and that a foreign
judgment based upon U.S. securities laws would be enforced in Germany. Therefore, a final judgment for the
payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or
not based on United States federal or state securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in Germany.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action
to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments,
other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given
by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A final judgment
by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court
of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original
matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by
a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

- U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence
according to German law;

- the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely
manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of noncompliance with such requirement, (i) the
defendant does not invoke such noncompliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the proceedings;

- the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or
(ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany
and the procedure leading to the respective judgment does not contradict any such judgment under (i) and (ii)
or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

- the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without
limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be
noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any
other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in
Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law;

- the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

- the judgment is final under U.S. federal or state law.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having
received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject
to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained
from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable.
Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation,
moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a

301


-----

German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws.

Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With
respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings
may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses.
Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery
process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany,
such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such
circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only
as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear
the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the
United States.

**Finland**

Certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Finland.

We have been advised by our Finnish counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and
Finland. Courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court.

Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition
and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will
constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing
law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before
it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public
nature or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the
application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the
Finnish legal system.

As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a
Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation of actual losses and damages
as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any
claims presented lies, with certain rare exceptions, with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is
also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession.

U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information
in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish
law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is limited, and a party
seeking to obtain such documents is required to be able to specify such documents with relative precision.
Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually
only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the
proceedings.

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium
as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and all of the managers and executive officers of the
Issuer are non-residents of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer is located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the
United States upon the Issuer, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.

We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound
by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered
in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies
rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S.
securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable
judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting
enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of

302


-----

the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg
of the U.S. judgment if all of the following conditions are met:

- the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable
U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the U.S. court is recognized by Luxembourg
private international and local law;

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules or, at least,
the court order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on case law and legal
doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a
Luxembourg court);

- the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of
Luxembourg;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear,
and if it appeared, to present a defense; and

- the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Please note that Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may
change: additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions may
not be verified by Luxembourg courts in the future.

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although
there is no statutory prohibition.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not made bona fide,
or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law would be
contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg public policy or public
order rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg
courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect
of punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation
expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment
expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party
in Luxembourg would be available only in Euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into
Euro.

**Switzerland**

We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in
Switzerland or the applicability of U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court.
The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or
state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal
or state court, however, may be recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with the proceeding set forth in particular by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law
(Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische
_Zivilprozessordnung) and the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (Bundesgesetz über_
_Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of_
the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Swiss court
would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss
Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), which include,
amongst others:

- The U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective;

303


-----

- The judgment being final and non-appealable under U.S. federal or state law, or no ordinary legal remedy
being available against such judgment;

- The defendant having had the chance to defend itself against any unduly or untimely served complaint except
for a defendant that unconditionally consented to the original proceeding before the respective court;

- The original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of Swiss civil
procedure law, in particular the right to be heard and the possibility to properly defend the relevant case;

- The matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter
(Verfahren) between the same parties pending before a Swiss court, provided such Swiss matter between the
same parties was pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings; and

- The enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss public
policy (schweizerischer Ordre public).

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot, however, assure you that any attempts to
enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would
recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive
proceedings in the sense of Article 6 of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über
_das internationale Privatrecht). In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might_
be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively,
a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the
extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Furthermore, it is not certain that a Swiss court, if substantive proceedings were commenced in Switzerland, would
apply U.S. federal or state laws. The applicable law will be determined in particular in accordance with the Swiss
Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), which may limit
the right of the parties to choose the applicable law. As an example, notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the
parties to an agreement, a court of Switzerland or other authority will not apply a provisions of foreign law if and
to the extent that this would, in the court’s or authority’s view, lead to a result violating Swiss public policy
(schweizerischer ordre public) or similar general principles. Moreover, a court of Switzerland or other authority
will apply, notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the parties, any provisions of Swiss law (and, subject to
further conditions, of another foreign law) which in the court’s or authority’s view imperatively demand
application in view of their specific purpose (lois d’application immédiate).

Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. For example, with
respect to the production of evidence, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based
on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial,
compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained
in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under
Swiss law. Instead, a Swiss court would decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties
and the related burden of proof.

Judicial documents may not be served directly from abroad on a person in Switzerland (see Switzerland’s
reservation to the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial or Extra Judicial Documents in Civil and
Commercial Matters concluded on November 15, 1965) and service must be effective by way of judicial
assistance.

Furthermore, under Swiss law, any amount denominated in a foreign currency and ordered to be paid pursuant to
a final judgment will be enforced by Swiss debt collection authorities and must be converted into Swiss Francs.

**CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES**

**GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW**

**CONSIDERATIONS**

_The validity and enforceability of the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited under applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. The_
_following is a brief description of limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Collateral and of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which Notes Guarantees or_
_Collateral are being provided. The descriptions below do not purport to be complete or discuss all of the_
_limitations or considerations that may affect the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or other security interests._
_Proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the_
_jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple_
_jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your_
_ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the security_
_interests on the Collateral. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect_
_to such limitations and considerations. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the_
_Financing,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial_
_Profile.” If additional collateral is required to be granted in the future pursuant to the Indenture, such collateral_
_will also be subject to limitations and enforceability and validity, which may differ from those discussed below._

**European Union**

The Issuer and all but one of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of member states of the European Union.

**_Main insolvency proceedings_**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/2260 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 15 December 2021, the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the
European Union. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union (the
“Member State”) (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The
“center of main interests” is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on
a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the center of main interests of a company or legal person is presumed to be located in the Member
State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the
registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the request for
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the
company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where
a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties,
that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located
in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception
as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of main
interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its
activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or
otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means).

If the “center of main interests” of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member
State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be
entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the
territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction
for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as
avoidance actions.

305


-----

**_Secondary insolvency proceedings_**

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in
the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in other Member
States. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article
3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction
to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an
“establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency
proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to
winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior
to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the
opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out
or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are
restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which
the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only
be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency
proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated
under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor
whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such establishment or a public authority, which
has the right to request such opening under the respective Member State’s law, requests the opening of such
proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings,
such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local_
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the respective main, territorial or secondary
insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the
main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member
State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so
long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure has
been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where
the company has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a
unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency
proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the
distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the
insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be
made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in
accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a
court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner
in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately
protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement
proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at
the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary
insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to
protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings
will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months, unless such a
request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued
or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require
the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the
interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

306


-----

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be
required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the
debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency,
administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may
be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws
of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

**_Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_**

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that
insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency
practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency
practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation
is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before
which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that
cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with
the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where
appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and,
except for shareholding interests in certain subsidiaries, substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In
the event of an insolvency of the certain Guarantors under the laws of Germany at the time the application for the
opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most
likely govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in
Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law
(for example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over
the certain Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular,
the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as
creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’
claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured
creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency
proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant
entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if
any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in
the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German
legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung
_von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for_
coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide
for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the
assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but
rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient
administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency
proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is
facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”

307


-----

(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator”
(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to,
claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a
consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening
of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below
under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.”

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex
officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung),
a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values),
unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a
prognosis period covering the next twelve (12) months (positive Fortführungsprognose). Under the Act on the
Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate Crisis Effects (Gesetz zur
_vorübergehenden Anpassung sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtlicher Vorschriften zur Abmilderung von_
_Krisenfolgen) (the “SanInsKG”), the forecast period relevant for the over-indebtedness test was reduced to four_
(4) months until December 31, 2023. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or
more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the
company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor
to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a
European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a company with limited liability
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable
shareholder becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain
circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay,
however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of
over-indebtedness at the latest six (6) weeks after over-indebtedness, occurred. Under the SanInsKG, the six-week
period following the occurrence of over-indebtedness was extended to a period of eight (8) weeks until December
31, 2023. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as
sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any
payments under the Notes, may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is
a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments
obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis
period (such period generally being 24 months). However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but
not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of imminent illiquidity.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court
will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the
debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the
debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the
supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that, inter alia, the debtor has enclosed a detailed and coherent
self-administration plan (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) to the petition for the debtor-in-possession status and no
circumstances are known which indicate that key aspects of the self-administration planning are based on
inaccurate facts. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may
appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for
debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to
suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’
committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested
individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’
committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does comprise a representative
of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees.
The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s
assets (which may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an
insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the

308


-----

insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings
(eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets
(Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not
expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g.,
creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not necessarily, the
same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a
debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right
to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency
administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual
appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and_
amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the insolvency administrator
and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced
and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to
continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as
preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an
unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the
available collateral (if any) also being as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of
formal insolvency proceedings against any of the Guarantors or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject
to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

      - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer
and dispose of the assets of such Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries would generally
pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the
insolvency estate;

      - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such
Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management such
Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and
void by operation of law;

      - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter,
a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a
security interest in part of such Guarantor’s or any of its relevant subsidiaries’ property that
would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by
operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and

      - claims against such Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in
accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one
party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons
justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln)
may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the
contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law.
This will likely also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute
part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be
enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency
estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims
against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings
are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency

309


-----

proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the
debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened.
Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency
proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights
(Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security
is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that
the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s
possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or
security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security
assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency
administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured
assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate,
usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus value added tax (if any), are disbursed to the creditor
holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining
unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate
(Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities
incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims
(insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured insolvency creditors and residual
claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied
on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the
security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however,
compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant
debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor
of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of
regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige
_Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the_
unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated
_Claims.”_

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of a Guarantor’s or any of its relevant subsidiaries’ assets
will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going
concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency
plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires,
among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of such Guarantor or any of its relevant
subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval
of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—
be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership
rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including
a transfer or issuance to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent
illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession
status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the
court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor business
(Schutzschirm). During the respective period granted by the court to prepare the insolvency plan, the creditors’
rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances,
the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to
suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court
unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or
impartial).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless
and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

310


-----

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings,
the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to
insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during
applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the
insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such
challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s
or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having
occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of
insolvency proceedings with respect to a Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by
the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of Collateral
for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback
rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out
in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is successfully voided
(angefochten), the holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes or the
Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already
been made under the Notes or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would
have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the Notes, as applicable,
would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes, as applicable, without preference in insolvency
proceedings.

Against this background, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes
the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the
debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the following
cases:

      - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was
illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such
illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or
(ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew
of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that compellingly
suggest such illiquidity or filing);

      - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or
obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled, if such act
was taken (i) during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after such filing, (ii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the
petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or
third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the
creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency
creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that compellingly suggest such detrimental
effect);

      - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by
which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim
against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three
months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the
debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew
of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or
of such filing at the time of the transaction;

      - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously
(unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings;

      - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the

311


-----

intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and
the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act
granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above
ten-year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of
such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid
(drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in
case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the
beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid
(eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors;
the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred
payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this
time;

      - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded
earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of
the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party”
includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board,
general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons
or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the
economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of
the household of any of the foregoing persons;

      - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder, for
repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security,
the act took place during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the
act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or

      - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent
claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the
debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which
case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further
conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice,
the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case
may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party”, there is a
general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge”.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the
Case of Insolvency Caused by the CoVID-19 Pandemic (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden Aussetzung der
_Insolvenzantragspflicht und zur Begrenzung der Organhaftung bei einer durch die COVID-19-Pandemie_
_bedingten Insolvenz) (the “COVInsAG”), however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and_
shareholder loans under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a certain time during the COVID19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and
shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant
financing was granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the
suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of thirdparty financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the repayment of
shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to a loan.

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and
may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg).

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security
right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The
prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from
the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

CABB Group GmbH, CABB GmbH, CABB Holding GmbH and CABB Europe GmbH (the “German
**Guarantors”) are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit**
_beschränkter Haftung or GmbH) and any security (including a guarantee) granted by such a GmbH is subject to_
certain provision of the Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter
_Haftung or GmbHG)._

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its
assets to its (direct or indirect) shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets determined in
accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) (i.e., assets minus liabilities
and liability reserves) is or would fall below, or increases or would increase an existing shortfall of, the amount
of its stated share capital (Begründung oder Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). The Notes Guarantees and any other
security granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are
considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure
the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and
to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures,
guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the
legal form of a GmbH incorporated or established in Germany. This could lead to a situation in which the
respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all.

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co, KG to be incorporated into the relevant Notes Documents
(as defined in “Description of the Notes”), in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as
follows:

“Auditor’s Determination” shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in paragraph (d) below.

“Enforcement Notice” shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in paragraph (c) below.

“German Guarantor” means any Guarantor incorporated in Germany as (x) a limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung - GmbH) or (y) a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a
limited liability company as general partner (a “German GmbH & Co. KG Guarantor”) in relation to whom
the Trustee intends to demand payment under the guarantee and indemnity created under the Indenture (the “Note
**Guarantee”).**

“Guaranteed Obligor” shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in paragraph (a) below.

“Management Determination” shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in paragraph (c) below.

“Net Assets” means (except to the extent to be calculated differently pursuant to jurisprudence from time to time
of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) relating to the protection of liable capital pursuant to
applicable laws) the relevant company’s assets (Section 266 para. (2) A, B, C, D and E German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch)), less the aggregate of its liabilities (Section 266 para. (3) B (but disregarding any accruals
(Rückstellungen) in respect of a potential enforcement of the Guarantee or any Transaction Security), C, D and E
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch)), the amount of profits (Gewinne) not available for distribution
to its shareholders in accordance with sections 253 para. 6, 268 para. 8 and 272 para. 5 German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch) (if any) and the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital).

(d) A Note Guarantee shall not be enforced (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Holders shall not request
the Trustee to enforce a Note Guarantee) if and to the extent that the Note Guarantee secures any liability
of the Issuer or a Guarantor which is an Affiliate of a German Guarantor (other than that German

313


-----

Guarantor’s Subsidiaries) (the “Guaranteed Obligor”) and if and to the extent that a payment under the
Note Guarantee would cause that German Guarantor’s (or, in the case of a German GmbH & Co. KG
Guarantor, its general partner’s) Net Assets (determined pursuant to paragraph (b) below) to be reduced
below zero, or further reduced if already below zero.

(e) For the purposes of the calculation of the Net Assets the following balance sheet items shall be adjusted
as follows:

(i) if the registered share capital of the German Guarantor or, where the German Guarantor is a
German GmbH & Co. KG Guarantor, of its general partner, is not fully paid up (nicht voll
_eingezahlt), the relevant amount which is not paid up shall be deducted from the registered share_
capital in accordance with section 272 para. 1 sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch) to the extent such amount is not demanded (eingefordert);

(ii) the amount of any increase of the stated share capital (Erhöhungen des Stammkapitals) of the
relevant German Guarantor or, where the Guarantor is a German GmbH & Co. KG Guarantor,
of its general partner after the date hereof that has been effected without the prior written consent
of the Trustee, shall be deducted from the stated share capital; and

(iii) liabilities incurred by the relevant German Guarantor or, as the case may be, its general partner,
in negligent or willful violation of the Indenture shall be disregarded.

(f) The enforcement of the Note Guarantee shall initially be excluded pursuant to paragraph (a) above if, no
later than 20 Business Days following a demand by the Trustee to make a payment under the Note
Guarantee (the “Enforcement Notice”), the managing directors on behalf of the German Guarantor have
confirmed in writing to the Trustee:

(i) to what extent the Note Guarantee granted hereunder is an up-stream or cross-stream guarantee
as described in paragraph (a) above; and

(ii) which amount of such cross-stream and/or up-stream guarantee cannot be enforced as it would
cause the Net Assets of the German Guarantor, or, where the guarantor is a German GmbH &
Co. KG Guarantor, its general partner to be less than its respective registered share capital
(taking into account the adjustments set out in paragraph (b) above and the realisation duties set
out in paragraph (e) below) (the “Management Determination”) and such confirmation is
supported by a reasonably satisfactory calculation provided that the Trustee shall in any event
be entitled to enforce the Note Guarantee for any amounts where such enforcement would, in
accordance with the Management Determination, not cause the German Guarantor’s, or, where
the Guarantor is a German GmbH & Co. KG Guarantor, its general partner’s Net Assets to be
less than (or to fall further below) the amount of its respective registered share capital (in each
case as calculated and adjusted in accordance with paragraph (b) above).

(g) Following the Trustee’s receipt of a Management Determination, any further enforcement of the Note
Guarantee (i.e. any enforcement to which the Trustee is not already entitled to pursuant to paragraph (e)
below) shall be excluded pursuant to paragraph (a) above. However, the further enforcement of the Note
Guarantee shall be limited only if the Trustee receives within 30 Business Days upon its request following
the Trustee’s receipt of the Management Determination (A) an up-to date balance sheet together with (B)
a determination in each case prepared by auditors of international standard and reputation appointed by
the relevant German Guarantor either confirming the Management Determination or setting out
deviations from the Management Determination (the “Auditor’s Determination”), if and to the extent
such enforcement would, in accordance with the Auditor’s Determination cause the German Guarantor’s,
or, where the Guarantor is a German GmbH & Co. KG Guarantor, its general partner’s Net Assets to be
less than (or to fall further below) the amount of its respective registered share capital in each case as
calculated and adjusted in accordance with paragraph (b) above. If the German Guarantor fails to deliver
an Auditor’s Determination within such 30 Business Days after the Trustee’s request, the shall be entitled
to enforce the Note Guarantee without any limitation or restriction.

(h) In addition, each German Guarantor and, in the case of a German GmbH & Co. KG Guarantor, also its
general partner, shall upon request of the Trustee realize, to the extent legally permitted and commercially
justifiable and to the extent necessary to satisfy the claims under the Note Guarantee, any and all of its
assets which are not required for the relevant German Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig)

314


-----

that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is substantially lower than the
market value of the relevant assets if, as a result of the enforcement of the Note Guarantee, its Net Assets
would be reduced below zero or further reduced if already below zero.

(i) The restriction under paragraph (a) above shall not apply:

(i) to the extent that the Note Guarantee secures any amounts under the Notes that are on-lent,
actually disbursed or otherwise passed on to the relevant German Guarantor or, as the case may
be, its general partner, or any of its Subsidiaries and not repaid, in each case if and to the extent
that the relevant German Guarantor or, as the case may be, its general partner is able to (x) setoff its recourse claims (if any) against the loan obligation in respect of the amounts on-lent to it
or the reimbursement claim resulting from the issuance of the guarantee or (y) otherwise use its
recourse claims (if any) to settle or discharge the relevant loan obligation or reimbursement
claim;

(ii) if the relevant German Guarantor or, as the case may be, its general partner, (as dominated
entity) is subject to a domination and/or profit transfer agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder
_Gewinnabführungsvertrag) (a “DPTA”) with the Guaranteed Obligor, whether directly or_
indirectly through a chain of DPTAs between each company and its shareholder (or in the case
of a German GmbH & Co. KG Guarantor between its general partner and its shareholder) and
has a fully recoverable compensation claim (Verlustausgleichsanspruch) pursuant to
Section 302 German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) against its dominating entity;

(iii) if and to extent the relevant German Guarantor has on the date of enforcement of the Note
Guarantee a fully recoverable indemnity or claim for refund (“vollwertiger Gegenleistungs_oder Rückgewähranspruch”) against its shareholder or the Guaranteed Obligor; or_

(iv) if and to the extent for any other reason (including, without limitation, as a result of a change in
the relevant rules of law or as a result of relevant jurisprudence of the German supreme court
(höchstrichterliche Rechtsprechung)) such limitation is not necessary in order to protect the
managing directors of the German Guarantor or, in the case of a German GmbH & Co. KG
Guarantor, its general partner, from personal liability pursuant to sections 30, 43(3) or 43 (2) of
the German Act on Limited Liability Companies (GmbH-Gesetz) (each as amended,
supplemented and/or replaced from time to time).

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be interpreted as a restriction or limitation of
(i) the enforcement of the Guarantee to the extent such Note Guarantee guarantees obligations of the
German Guarantor itself in its capacity as Issuer or obligations of any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries
including in each case their legal successors or (ii) the enforcement of any claim of the Trustee or any
Holder against the Issuer under the Indenture.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims to ensure
that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial distress to
solve their problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings (Directive of the European
Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and
disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency
and discharge of debt, and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive Restructuring Directive”)).

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of
the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of
the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Gesetz
_über den Stabilisierungs und Restrukturierungsrahmen für Unternehmen) (the “Company Stabilisation and_
**Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in**
Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”)
are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent restructuring
court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in cases in which a
debtor faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), _i.e., that there is the imminent risk for the_
debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24
months.

315


-----

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act upon the
occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the
debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The debtor’s
management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act.
Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are
met (see above under “—Insolvency.”).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company
Stabilisation and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s
liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In
addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under
the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be
kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public
notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilisation and
Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important
exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected
entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act
provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the
law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency.”).

The core component of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a
debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest
rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release
of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister
companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved
by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan which can be submitted solely
by the debtor will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each
class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by
the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the
subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be
adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain legal
requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so
as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a
stabilisation order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such
stabilisation order can, among other things, restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The
stabilisation order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to
extend the stabilisation order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company
Stabilisation and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its center of main
interest in Germany would be the following:

      - The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or
only limited review and/or supervision by a court;

      - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a
period of up to eight months due to a stabilisation order;

      - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be
compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in
principal and/or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release
and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right);

      - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to
Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral;
and

316


-----

      - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder
of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a crossclass cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court are recognized in any EU
member state under the EU Insolvency Regulation since the German lawmaker decided to include public
restructuring proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act in Exhibit A of said Regulation.
In any other case (i.e., a “private” proceeding), recognition of a restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and
regulations under applicable international private law.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor
on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below
the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts
if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors
from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors
due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines,
as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay
money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for repayment of a
shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic
terms to such a loan. unless a state aid bank or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant
company have granted the respective loan or legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.
The COVInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from
economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted
shareholder loans that were granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and where the debtor fulfilled the
requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time.

**_Accessory Security Interests/Parallel Debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature and are
therefore dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the secured claim to
be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the
extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would
automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be
granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest.

The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a
creditor under the Notes. The holders on the other hand are creditors under the Notes. In order to allow the holders
to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the
Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the holders’ claims under the Notes
directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and
Guarantors under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect
of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the
parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have,
pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Guarantor for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal
concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it cannot
be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the
risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the
collateral may be restricted.

Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the
Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully
claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the secured claims. As
a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain
with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.

**Finland**

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Finnish law. The first, company restructuring (yrityssaneeraus)
is split into early company restructuring (varhainen saneerausmenettely) and regular company restructuring.
Regular company restructuring is intended to investigate whether the business has a reasonable chance to continue
and, if so, to rehabilitate the company’s viable business, ensure its continued viability and make arrangements
with creditors. The objective of the early company restructuring is to prevent potential insolvency. The second,
bankruptcy (konkurssi), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors.

**_Company Restructuring_**

_Regular Company Restructuring_

If a company is insolvent or is at risk of becoming insolvent, and it is likely that a company restructuring may
remedy the insolvency or prevent its recurrence otherwise than for a short period, an application for company
restructuring can be made to a court by the debtor or by one or more creditors. Furthermore, the initiation of
restructuring proceedings is possible - in theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation - when at least
two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related
to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for
company restructuring. If there are no specific legal barriers to company restructuring and, consequently, the court
approves the application and initiates restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint an
administrator (selvittäjä).

The administrator appointed by the court (among others) looks after the creditors’ interests in the restructuring
proceedings, prepares an inventory of the company’s assets and debts and prepares a proposal for the restructuring
programme. The court will often appoint a creditors committee to assist and supervise the administrator. Despite
the initiation of the restructuring proceedings, the directors of the company continue to act on behalf of the
company but their powers are somewhat limited. The administrator supervises the operation of the company’s
business. After restructuring proceedings have been initiated, the debtor may not, without the consent of the
administrator:

(i) take new loans (except for such loans which are within the ordinary course of business and the amount
and terms of which are not unusual);

(ii) transfer the company or a part thereof or any of its assets which are required for its business purposes;

(iii) grant rights to the assets covered under (ii) above (except in the ordinary course of business);

(iv) transfer current assets other than in the ordinary course of business and with customary terms;

(v) terminate agreements which are necessary for carrying on business;

(vi) grant security for a third party’s debt (except within the ordinary course of business and provided that
the risks involved are not unusual);

(vii) take other actions, which are unusual or material; or

(viii) petition for bankruptcy.

During the restructuring proceedings, the creditors of the debtor company generally exercise their powers through
the creditors committee. The creditors committee has a supervisory role and is not involved in the day-to-day
management of the company.

During the restructuring proceedings, the administrator has the duty to:

(i) compile a list of the company’s assets, liabilities and other undertakings, as well as to draft a report of
any factors likely to affect the financial status of the company;

(ii) monitor the activities of the company;

(iii) to the extent necessary, conduct an audit of the activities of the company prior to the commencement of
the restructuring proceedings;

318


-----

(iv) initiate any proceedings for the reversal of transactions entered into by the debtor;

(v) prepare a draft restructuring program; and

(vi) manage the restructuring proceedings pursuant to the Finnish Company Restructuring Act (Laki yrityksen
_saneerauksesta)._

The administrator has a duty to perform his functions with regard to the interests of the creditors as a whole as
well as with regard to the interests of the company. The administrator has a general duty of care and shall act
fairly and honorably whilst in office.

All existing debts and claims against the company are suspended as of the commencement of the company
restructuring. The suspension as a main rule prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and
enforcement of the restructuring debts (although debts arising after filing for company restructuring may be both
repaid and enforced) and the seizure of assets. Restructuring debt, by definition, refers to all debt that has arisen
prior to filing for restructuring, irrespective of when this debt falls due.

The suspensions are in force until a restructuring program has been confirmed by the district court or the
proceedings have been dismissed. Once the company restructuring program has been confirmed by the court, the
company may pay the restructuring debts only in accordance with the program.

All agreements entered into by the debtor remain in force and may not be terminated by a creditor, with certain
exceptions. The administrator has the right to end certain agreements upon initiation of the restructuring
proceedings such as lease agreements, credit-lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular
part of the activities of the debtor and employment relationships.

Creditors with equal ranking have equal standing in the arrangements of the restructuring debts within the
restructuring program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Company Restructuring Act (Laki
_yrityksen saneerauksesta), the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the_
restructuring program: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be considered as payments
against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reduce the obligation to
pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reduce the outstanding
principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of
debt. Consequently, the restructuring procedure could result in holders of the Notes receiving a right to recover
considerably less than they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the Notes Guarantee. It is to be noted,
however, that the restructuring may not lead to a worse outcome for the creditors than the bankruptcy of the debtor.

Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest
to assets that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, insofar as the value of the security at the
commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the
deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority, i.e., the amount of the creditor’s claim exceeding
the value of the security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, will constitute unsecured debt and may,
thus be subject to the measures described above. Regarding floating charges (yrityskiinnitys), only 50% of the
value of the charged assets will be considered as secured debt.

The administrator determines the value of the security. The part of the debt for which the value of the security is
insufficient is considered unsecured debt, and may thus be restructured as unsecured debt (e.g., haircut). Should
the security be deemed worthless or the standing of the creditor sufficiently junior in relation to other creditors
with the same security, the debt may be even considered unsecured in its entirety.

The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order
that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs
second; or (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of
the debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the
security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate
security. Payments on a secured debt shall be determined so that at least the present value of the secured debt will
be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the
consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed one-half of the original
credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the
remaining credit period, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and
credit costs.

319


-----

Restructuring of both unsecured and secured debt may take place only to the extent deemed necessary for the
success of the restructuring proceedings.

Bondholders are primarily each regarded as individual creditors to the debtor. The bondholders may, however,
appoint a trustee to represent the bondholder collectively in relation to the debtor and the administrator.

_Early Company Restructuring_

Early company restructuring can be initiated if the debtor is facing insolvency. The threat of insolvency must be
concrete and foreseeable, but it does not need to be acute in a way as required in connection with regular company
restructuring. In early restructuring it is not necessary to appoint an administrator albeit one would usually be
appointed. The aim for early restructuring proceedings is to be faster than regular proceedings. Early restructuring
proceedings have fewer prerequisites and impediments for initiation and continuation to ensure that viable
companies can take preventive restructuring measures more easily. The early restructuring proceedings may not
be initiated or must be terminated when:

(i) the debtor is insolvent;

(ii) it is likely that the debtor's assets are insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings and no one has
agreed to bear these costs;

(iii) it is likely that the debtor will not be able to pay off debts arising after the opening of proceedings; or

(iv) the bookkeeping of the debtor is substantially insufficient or deficient.

In addition to the above, the main differences between the regular and early restructuring proceedings relate,
among other things, to moratoria and the approval of the restructuring program without the acceptance of majority
in all groups of creditors. Other than that, there are no material differences in relation to the restructuring program
and how the program is approved in the early and regular proceedings.

In the early proceedings, a general moratorium shall be imposed unless it is likely that a moratorium will not be
necessary. However, a general moratorium shall not be imposed, if the debtor so requests. If a general moratorium
is imposed, it is in force for three months, and can be extended to a maximum of 12 months. The court may also
on application impose a temporary moratorium before the actual proceedings are initiated. The temporary
moratorium can be in force for the maximum of three months. The duration of the temporary moratorium is taken
into account when calculating the aforementioned total maximum of 12 months. Upon the expiration of the
maximum period, the early restructuring proceedings should be completed, but if that is not the case it is possible
to commence regular proceedings or if the company is insolvent, apply for bankruptcy.

**_Bankruptcy_**

A debtor or its creditor may apply for bankruptcy from a court of competent jurisdiction when the debtor has
failed to pay its debts and the inability to pay is not temporary. If the application is approved, an estate
administrator (pesänhoitaja) (or several estate administrators) of the bankruptcy estate will be appointed by the
court.

Bankruptcy covers all liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the
proceeds received therefrom in payment of the creditors’ claims. In order to achieve the objective of bankruptcy,
the debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator.
The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and
guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors. The creditors are
represented through the creditor’s meeting, and a creditors’ committee may be appointed by the court. The
bankruptcy estate may (exceptionally) continue with the company’s business operations, and the disposal of
property will be realized as soon as reasonably possible.

As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must lodge a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a
“letter of lodgement”), by delivering it to the estate administrator no later than the deadline set by the estate
administrator. The obligation to lodge a claim binds even secured creditors. Failure to lodge a claim may lead to
the expiration of the debt. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third
party must, at the request of and within a time limit set by the estate administrator, provide the information on
receivables and collateral that should be provided in a letter of lodgement. A creditor who holds a floating charge
over the assets of the debtor as security of a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other

320


-----

debtor shall lodge the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (Konkurssilaki). If a claim is denominated
in a currency other than euro, a value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using
the exchange rate at the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.

A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving
notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a letter
of lodgement.

Similar creditors have an equal right to payment from the funds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion to the
amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. The Act on the Ranking of Claims (Laki velkojien
_maksunsaantijärjestyksestä) determines the order in which debts are settled. The following creditors have_
precedence over unsecured creditors to receive disbursement from the estate: (i) secured creditors and holders of
retention rights have priority to the proceeds relating to the relevant asset; (ii) creditors of the administrative
expenses of the bankruptcy estate, creditors with claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather
than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law
and creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceeding;
and (iii) creditors with claims that are secured by a floating charge will receive prior to other claims a disbursement
of 50% of the net proceeds of the charged assets (after the claims of creditors with a better priority position have
been satisfied). The rights of the above-mentioned preferential creditors may adversely affect the interests of
holders of the Notes. Bankruptcy of a Finnish Notes Guarantor could result in holders of the Notes recovering
considerably less than they would have otherwise been entitled to recover under the Notes Guarantee. Further, it
should be noted that debt incurred after the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, such as debt the estate has
committed to, is prioritized and effectively reduce disbursable funds, and security with higher priority naturally
affects the value of the security of the secured creditor with a lower priority.

The Finnish Act on the Ranking of Claims specifies which debt is ranked with the lowest priority. Such debt may
be, for example, any interest accrued after the commencement of the bankruptcy, capital loans, or bonds issued
with a lower priority in relation to other indebtedness by the debtor. In practice, there rarely remain disbursable
funds to even partially cover claims with the lowest priority. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding
taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous
manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds. However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a
fixed charge over movable or immovable property may exercise their right to enforce such collateral regardless
of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale for a maximum
of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor protected by
the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission.

_Effect of bankruptcy on the bankruptcy debtor’s contracts_

As such, the debtor’s contracts are not automatically terminated upon the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.
Contract clauses by which contracts are immediately terminated upon bankruptcy are generally considered null
and void, and are thus unenforceable. Pursuant to the Finnish Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy estate is generally
entitled to become party to any contracts of the debtor by notifying the creditor of this within a reasonable time.
As noted above, debt arisen from such a contract entered into by the bankruptcy estate is prioritized over
bankruptcy debts.

If a bankruptcy estate is willing to become party to a contract, the law entitles a creditor to request acceptable
collateral from the bankruptcy estate to secure the performance of the contract. Should the bankruptcy estate be
unwilling or unable to provide such collateral to the creditor, the creditor is entitled to terminate the contract.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Law_**

Pursuant to the Finnish Act on the Recovery of Assets to Bankruptcy Estate (Laki takaisinsaannista
_konkurssipesään) (the “Recovery Act”), certain acts performed by a debtor may be reversed if the rights of_
creditors have been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Finnish Company Restructuring Act and the Finnish
Enforcement Code (Ulosottokaari), the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied
in restructuring and enforcement proceedings.

The bankruptcy estate administrator, the restructuring administrator and certain creditors may seek to recover
assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, restructuring or enforcement proceedings. The administrator
or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s counterparty in
a separate court proceeding or file an objection.

321


-----

Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who
becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded
within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or enforcement is filed with the
court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the
transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of
other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of other creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of
the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent
or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted;
(iii) the counterparty of the transaction knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or of
the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have
known the facts mentioned above in paragraph (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper.
The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between
the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had
qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain
(natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered
regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are assumed to have had knowledge of the issues
described above in (i) and (ii).

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the
good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such
transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through foreclosure; (ii) the payment of debts;
and (iii) the granting of security. Payment received by a creditor through foreclosure effected by the relevant
authority later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or
foreclosure is filed with the court (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of
interest, within two years) may be recovered. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the
petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event
that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years (in case of recovery with
respect to payment of debt between closely related parties made later than two years, but before three months
from when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority,
the recovery may be rejected if it is shown that debtor was not insolvent nor became insolvent due to the payment))
may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the
amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be
recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given
later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with
the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of
interest, within two years (in case of recovery with respect to granting security between closely related parties
made later than two years, but before three months from when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or
foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority, the recovery may be rejected if it is shown that debtor was
not insolvent nor became insolvent due to the granting of security)) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not
agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not
been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the
granting of the credit.

When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the bankruptcy
estate or the debtor. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that has been paid for the
property. If the funds have been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the funds knew
or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation for the estate to return the
funds. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value
of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party
under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead
of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value
of the recovered property.

Accordingly, the validity of the Notes Guarantee or any payment made thereunder may be challenged under the
Recovery Act and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. If the granting of a Notes Guarantee or
a payment thereunder is successfully challenged under the Recovery Act, then the granting of such a Notes
Guarantee could be nullified or the payment recovered. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the
Notes may not enjoy the benefit of a Notes Guarantee, and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes
received with respect to a Notes Guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes, i.e.
the holders of Notes may be ordered to return any proceeds received pursuant to a Notes Guarantee.

322


-----

**_Limitations_**

The Notes Guarantee granted by the Finnish Guarantors and any future guarantor incorporated in Finland will be
limited by a general limitation that limits the scope of the guarantee to the extent the grant of such guarantee
would be contrary to certain mandatory provisions of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act
(Osakeyhtiölaki) (624/2006, as amended) (the “Finnish Companies Act”). Pursuant to such limitation, the
beneficiaries of the Notes Guarantee agree to enforce the guarantee against any Finnish Guarantor only to the
extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies
Act by that Finnish Guarantor. Certain significant limitations to a company’s ability to grant guarantees are
included in Sections 1 and 10 of Chapter 13 of the Finnish Companies Act regulating corporate benefit, unlawful
distribution of funds and prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a Finnish limited
liability company, such as a Finnish Guarantor, is prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or security
for the purpose of a third party acquiring shares in such company or its parent companies. Further, the Finnish
Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be granted (or any other transaction entered into) by a
Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds, meaning unless doing so is in the company’s own
commercial interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate benefit to the company, all relevant benefits
and risks to the company are to be taken into account. In the context of the Notes Guarantee, among other things,
other guarantees and security granted or to be granted by the Finnish Guarantors for the other financing
arrangements of the Group in connection with, among other things, the New Revolving Credit Facility, are to be
taken into consideration. The actual scope of the Notes Guarantee by a Finnish Guarantor may therefore be
substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that
owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to corporate benefit, unlawful distribution of assets
and/or financial assistance, as applied to the Notes Guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law,
be held to be effectively guaranteed.

The Indenture will expressly provide substantially as follows: Notwithstanding any other provisions of the
applicable Indenture to the contrary, the obligations of any Finnish Guarantor under the applicable Indenture shall
be limited to the extent they would constitute (i) unlawful distribution of company’s assets within the meaning of
Chapter 13, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act or (ii) prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of
Chapter 13, Section 10 of the Finnish Companies Act or (iii) be otherwise contrary to the mandatory provisions
of the Finnish Companies Act.

**_Establishing Security Interest_**

_General_

In order to create a valid security interest under Finnish law, the following criteria must generally be met: (a) there
must be an underlying debtor-creditor relationship in respect of the obligations which the security purports to
secure; (b) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the form of a pledge agreement; and (c) an act
perfecting the security interest must take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.

Under Finnish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest (pledge) by the
secured party and the grantor (pledgor), for any security (pledge) to be validly created, the grantor (pledgor) must
be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest
(pledge). Any security interest (pledge) purported to be created under Finnish law over assets which the grantor
(pledgor) may remain in possession of, retain exclusive or shared control over, entitled to operate or collect, invest
and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective
until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interest (pledge) has been perfected. Such unperfected
security interest (pledge) is vulnerable of being set aside in any insolvency proceedings affecting the grantor
(pledgor) and may, potentially, be declared void.

A security provided by an entity incorporated in Finland will be perfected as disclosed below.

_Shares_

In the case of shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved in respect of a private limited liability company by
(i) transferring the share certificate(s) (if issued) to the possession of the secured party and/or (ii) notifying the
company of the pledge.

323


-----

_Claims in General_

Pledges can also be granted and perfected in receivables and other claims (including dividends). Security over
receivables and claims (other than claims represented by negotiable instruments) is perfected by way of
notification to the debtor of the underlying claim. There is no requirement as to the form for such notification.
However, in order to obtain the intended result, the pledgor or the secured party should state that the claim has
been pledged to the secured party and the notice must also effectively prohibit the underlying debtor from paying
the pledgor. This means that the underlying debtor must be instructed to make payments to the pledgee (instead
of the pledgor). Any claims/receivables pledged as Collateral to secure the Notes will not be perfected on the Issue
Date, and will not be perfected until an enforcement event. In respect of negotiable promissory notes, the
perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the promissory notes into the possession of the secured party.

_Floating Charges and Real Estate Mortgages_

In the case of Finnish floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates, the perfection of the
pledge is achieved by transferring the duly issued and registered Finnish floating charge promissory notes into the
possession of the secured party and registering the secured party or its representative as the holder of electronic
real estate mortgage certificates in the register of real estate mortgages maintained by the National Land Survey
of Finland (Maanmittauslaitos). The capital amounts of floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage
certificates do not necessarily correlate with the value of the assets covered by the relevant floating charges and
real estate mortgages, and are often materially higher than the actual value of such assets. Therefore, the capital
amount of floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates cannot be used as an indication
of potential recovery in an enforcement scenario.

Limitations on the recovery of the creditors with claims that are secured by a floating charge have been discussed
above under Company Restructuring and Bankruptcy.

_Certain Security granted by a Finnish Guarantor_

CABB Finland Oy as a Finnish Guarantor has granted a security by pledging its shares in CABB Oy (including
related rights pertaining thereto) under a security agreement governed by Finnish law (the “Finnish Security
**Agreement”). In relation to the payment of dividends, CABB Oy whose shares, and dividends related thereto,**
have been pledged under the Finnish Security Agreement may make payments of the dividends to CABB Finland
Oy (as pledgor) until the pledge may be enforced pursuant to the Finnish Security Agreement and the Security
Agent has instructed CABB Oy to make all payments to the Security Agent.

Therefore, the pledge of dividends created under the Finnish Security Agreement has not been duly perfected
under Finnish law and is thus vulnerable to being set aside or being declared void.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_General_

Enforcement can take place either outside of bankruptcy proceedings or during bankruptcy proceedings under
certain criteria. Instead, in company restructuring proceedings, a moratorium applies and enforcement is generally
not possible. The terms of the relevant security agreement regulate the enforcement, however, subject to
constraints set by mandatory Finnish law.

Complex, case specific legal issues often apply to enforcement. These aspects are discussed below on a general
level only.

_Enforcement outside of Bankruptcy Proceedings_

Depending on the type of security arrangement/asset under security, the secured creditor may, generally, enforce
the security independently (such as security over shares and receivables) or through public enforcement authorities
(such as floating charges and real estate mortgages).

When enforcing a security, the secured creditor has a duty to take into account, in an appropriate way in the
circumstances, the interests of the pledgor and those of other potential interested parties, such as any second lien
pledgees or floating charge holders. In practice, this means, inter alia, that the secured creditor may not sell the
secured assets for a price lower than fair market value in the then current circumstances. This duty of care is
generally deemed to apply irrespective of the terms of the security agreement.

324


-----

When the secured creditor enforces security outside of bankruptcy proceedings and to the extent that the net
proceeds exceed the creditor’s secured claim, the secured creditor must hold the excess proceeds for the account
of any second lien pledgees, floating charge holders and/or the pledgor, as appropriate.

_Enforcement during Bankruptcy Proceedings_

In a bankruptcy scenario where the secured creditor enforces the security independent from the concurrent
bankruptcy proceedings (which is possible in respect of _e.g.,_ security over shares and receivables, but not for
floating charges), the secured creditor will use the enforcement proceeds to satisfy its secured claim. The secured
creditor shall then render to the bankruptcy administrator an account of the proceeds of the enforcement and
transfer to the bankruptcy administrator the net proceeds from the enforcement that exceed the creditor’s secured
claim.

After bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated, there are four options available for the enforcement of a real
estate mortgage:

(i) Private (or public) sale by the administrator with the consent of the mortgagee(s).

(ii) If the mortgagee(s) does not give its consent for the administrator to effect a private (or public) sale, the
administrator may seek the court’s approval for the sale.

(iii) Despite the bankruptcy proceedings, the mortgagee can proceed to seek a court order to allow the
mortgagee to independently enforce the mortgage by arranging the sale of the underlying real property
through public enforcement authorities (however, the administrator may impose an interim moratorium
up to two months’ time period).

(iv) After three years have passed since the commencement of the bankruptcy, public sale by the
administrator without the consent of the mortgagee(s) or a court order.

In a bankruptcy scenario where the bankruptcy administrator enforces the security, the bankruptcy administrator
will distribute the enforcement proceeds to the secured creditor up to the amount of the creditor’s secured claim,
whereas any excess proceeds will form a part of the assets of the estate (to be distributed to creditors).

Irrespective of whether the enforcement in bankruptcy was carried out by the secured creditor independently or
by the bankruptcy administrator, should the enforcement proceeds not suffice to satisfy the creditor’s secured
claim, the outstanding balance of the secured creditor’s claim will constitute an ordinary unsecured claim towards
the bankruptcy estate and will rank pro rata with the claims of other unsecured creditors.

_Enforcement during Company Restructuring Proceedings_

If company restructuring proceedings have been initiated against the pledgor, the pledgee can no longer enforce
the pledge independently (nor accelerate the underlying loans against the pledgor) and any enforcement
procedures already initiated (but not completed) will be discontinued. The prohibition to enforce the pledge is in
force until the court has passed a decision to either accept or reject the restructuring program proposed by the
administrator. In early proceedings, a general moratorium shall be imposed unless it is likely that a moratorium
will not be necessary. However, a general moratorium shall not be imposed, if the debtor so requests. If imposed,
it can be in place for a maximum of 12 months. The moratorium does not apply where the security in question
qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Finnish Act on Financial Collateral (Rahoitusvakuuslaki)
or where the security is situated within the territory of another Member State as provided for in Article 5(1) of the
Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings.

If the restructuring program is accepted by the court, the enforcement of pledges is likely to be covered by the
restructuring program. Should the proposed program be rejected, the most likely outcome is the initiation of
bankruptcy proceedings.

_Security Granted in Favor of an Agent_

There is some uncertainty under Finnish law as to whether security can validly be granted in favor of an agent or
trustee alone and not in favor of the relevant pledgees/secured parties. However, the Finnish Act on Bondholder
Representatives (Laki joukkolainanhaltijoiden edustajasta) recognizes the concept of security agency as part of
Finnish law. The pledgees/secured parties may be represented by an agent who can enter into the relevant security
agreement for and on behalf of the pledgees/secured parties based on a power of attorney or a mandate of agency.

325


-----

It is generally considered under Finnish law that an irrevocable authorization and an irrevocable appointment of
agent may nevertheless be revoked at any time by the principal. To address the aforesaid uncertainty about the
enforceability of a pledge granted solely in favor of an agent or a trustee, the Finnish Security Agreement has been
executed by the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties.

_Liquidation due to capital deficiency_

The Finnish Companies Act requires a company to give notification to the Finnish Patent and Registration Office
(Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus) should its equity become negative, but does not include any provisions mandating
the board of directors of a company to file for bankruptcy or restructuring or place the company into liquidation
due to the financial standing of the company. However, the law includes provisions concerning the management’s
liability for damages deliberately or negligently caused to the company, or due to violation of the duty of care. A
director may therefore be de facto required to file the company for bankruptcy or restructuring proceedings or
apply for liquidation, which may adversely affect the value of any securities or guarantees given by the company.
Public limited companies are subject to certain additional requirements due to capital deficiency.

**Luxembourg**

**_Insolvency_**

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, the ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited
than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. The Notes will be issued by the Issuer which is incorporated
under the laws of Luxembourg. Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open
main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer, as an entity having its registered office and central
administration (administration centrale) and centre of main interests (“COMI”), as defined in the EU Insolvency
Regulation, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to
article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI in
the jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office if its registered office has not moved to another
member state within 3 months prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. As a result, there is
a rebuttable presumption that the COMI of the Issuer is in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and consequently
that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) would be opened by a
Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law.

However, the determination of where the Issuer has its COMI is a question of fact, which may change from time
to time. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to
the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is ascertainable by
third parties.

In that respect, the courts have to take a number of factors into consideration, such as: the place where board
meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where
the large majority of the company’s creditors are established. These factors may all be relevant in the
determination of the place where the company has its COMI. The point at which a company’s COMI is determined
is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may
be initiated against a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its COMI or an establishment in Luxembourg
(in the latter case assuming that the COMI is located in a jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is
applicable):

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any of its
creditors or by the courts _ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction_
may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments
(“cessation des paiements”) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (“ébranlement de crédit”). The
main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between
creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement
against the company except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors
(please see below for the applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005) and the payment of the
secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or
directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due
with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s
cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the

-----

company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be held
(i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of managers’/ directors’ liability
for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with
article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code;

- controlled management proceedings (“gestion contrôlée”), the opening of which may only be requested by
the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order the provisional stay of
enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see below for the applicable provision of the
**Financial Collateral Law 2005);**

- composition proceedings (“concordat préventif de la faillite”), the opening of which may only be requested
by the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors
directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a
provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for secured creditors (please see below for the
applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005); or

- in addition to these proceedings, the ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of
(i) a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (“sursis de paiement”) or to put a Luxembourg company
into judicial liquidation (“liquidation judiciaire”) or (ii) the Luxembourg public prosecutor to initiate a
procedure for administrative dissolution without liquidation (“dissolution administrative sans liquidation”)
against a Luxembourg company. Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public
prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or
violation of the Luxembourg commercial code (Code de Commerce) or of the Luxembourg law of August
10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Companies Law 1915”). The management of such
liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy
proceedings.

Liability of the Issuer or a a Luxembourg guarantor, if any, in respect of the relevant Notes will, in the event of
liquidation following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under
Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others:

- remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum
social salary);

- employees’ contributions to social security;

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

- employer’s contribution to social security;

- landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; and

- value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for distribution to
unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized).

Favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing monetary claims
(or claims for the delivery of financial instruments) pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Article 20 of
the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements (pledges,
security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as valuation and
enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties, are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the
pre-bankruptcy preference period (période suspecte) against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators
and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud).

Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial
instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law
notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in
nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law 2005. If article
24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save in the case of fraud).

327


-----

Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been
entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or
the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators,
insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the
fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably
be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement.

_Impact of insolvency proceedings on transactions_

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Other than
as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors (except for secured creditors benifitting from a financial
collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 (please see below for the
applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005)) to enforce their security interest may also be limited,
in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of secured
creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled
management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order
requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the Issuer’s liabilities
in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon
the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.
However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of default may still be served.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the
suspect period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months plus ten days preceding the judgment
declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at
an earlier date. In particular:

- pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg commercial code, specified transactions (such as, in particular, the
granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within
the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether
payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts
which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without
consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference period (or the
ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

- pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg commercial code, payments made for matured debts as well as
other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by the
court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of
the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg commercial code and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code
(action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any
fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intentto defraud, made prior
to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination of
contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the
bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid
worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any
unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material
adverse effect on the Issuer’s or a Luxembourg guarantor’s (if any) business and assets and the Issuer’s or such
Luxembourg guarantor’s respective obligations under the Notes.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings
may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located within the territory
of another Member State at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings will not be affected by the opening
of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice, however, to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness,
voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24
of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 as described above and article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of guarantees given by Luxembourg guarantors, if any, and the_**
**_Security Interests_**

Under Luxembourg law, contracts are in principle formed by the mere agreement (consentement) between the
parties thereto. The granting of any financial collateral governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005 must be
capable of being evidenced in writing. However, additional steps are required to enforce security interests against
third parties. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts will generally apply, in relation
to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over the assets subject to such security interests,
the law of the place where such assets are situated (lex rei sitae or lex situs). As a consequence, Luxembourg law
should apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or
deemed to be located in Luxembourg, if any, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts
held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/ claims having debtors located in Luxembourg and/or governed by
Luxembourg law, securities which are held through an account located (or deemed to be located) in Luxembourg
and bearer securities physically held in Luxembourg.

If certain assets are located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be
governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law.
The creation, validity and enforcement of security interests such as pledges and transfers of ownership as security,
granted on financial instruments and claims (in order to secure cash settlement and/or delivery of financial
instruments) are governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005,
a pledge (gage) is effected by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party acting
as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in existence
as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets.

As the physical transfer of possession is not possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the Financial
Collateral Law 2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession (i.e., perfection) which is effected by
mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the dispossession
is validly realized by notifying the pledge to the issuer of such shares or by an acceptance of the pledge by the
issuer of such shares who in turn will proceed to an entry of the pledge in the share register held by the issuer of
such shares.

A pledge granted over intercompany receivables is perfected once the relevant pledge agreement has been entered
into by all parties thereto. However, in order for the debtor under the pledged receivables not to be able to validly
liberate itself from its payment obligations thereunder by paying the pledgor instead of the pledgee, when the
pledge agreement provides that such payment shall inure to the pledgee, the debtor of such receivables needs to
be notified of or has to accept the pledge granted thereover.

A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the
account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If
(future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank
will be required.

The above perfection steps and actions need to be undertaken by the grantor of the security interest and/or the
Security Agent. If the relevant grantor or the Security Agent fails or is unable to take the necessary steps/actions
required to take or perfect any of the above-mentioned security interests, such security interests will not have been
created and/or perfected with respect to the claims arising under the Notes.

Article 11 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 sets out the following enforcement methods, available upon the
occurrence of the relevant enforcement event in respect of a pledge governed by the provisions of the Financial
Collateral Law 2005:

- appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined
in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the market price of the pledged assets
(if the pledged assets are admitted to trading on a trading venue);

- assigning or causing the assignment of the pledged assets (i) by private sale in a commercially reasonable
manner (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) on a trading venue on which the pledged assets are admitted
to trading, or (iii) by way of a public auction;

- court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

329


-----

- set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Financial Collateral Law 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method
chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve
third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might
be delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be
enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Luxembourg law governed
security interests may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located outside of
Luxembourg.

Security interests/arrangements which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any
receivers/administrators may not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the
Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg
courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, unless
“main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law
and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in
which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to pledge agreements, if any, does not prevent any third
party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests
created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek
the forced sale of the assets of the pledgor through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges
will in principle remain entitled in priority to the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of
law).

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees and/or security interests, applicable corporate procedures
normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been
appointed for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged guarantees and/or security interests must
comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object. The proposed action by the company must be “in the
corporate interest of the company”, which is a translation of the French “intérêt social”, an equivalent term to the
English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been
developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate
behavior”.

Whereas previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions
of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit is subjective. In a group context, the
interest of the companies of the group taken individually is not entirely eliminated. With respect to guarantors
and/or security grantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Companies Law 1915 does not provide for rules
governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee and/or secure the indebtedness of another entity of
the same group, it is generally held that within a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in
granting upstream or cross-stream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee or security)
to other group companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant
such guarantee or security, provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any event to all the
factual circumstances of the matter): (i) such guarantee or security must be given for the purpose of promoting a
common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire
group, (ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee or security must not be without consideration and such
commitment must not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group
companies, and (iii) such guarantee or security granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the
financial capabilities of the committing company.

Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee or a security interest on a group level
is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of corporate
interest for one or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate benefit is of
particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Companies
Law 1915. The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (personal
and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The guarantees or security interests
granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary
to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses
addressed by the Company Law 1915, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for
misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may
be an interested third party, _e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In_

330


-----

addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a
misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by
court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article
1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915 will be held null and void.

The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment is
required to be made by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the above
developments, the guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company, if any, will be subject to certain limitations,
which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg
company to a certain percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres) and certain intra-group liabilities),
which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and which covers the
aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indentures
or guarantee agreements.

The registration of the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees and the
transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) with the Administration de l’Enregistrement,
_des Domaines et de la TVA_ in Luxembourg may be required in the case that the Notes, the security interest
agreements, the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection
therewith) are either (i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory
registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire) or
(iii) registered on a voluntary basis. In such case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for
instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable
depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security
interest agreements, which are subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. The Luxembourg courts or the official
Luxembourg authority may require (when these are presented before them) that the Notes, the security interest
agreements, the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection
therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German, except if the relevant
documents are drafted in English.

**United States**

Certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of the United States and the laws of certain states thereof. Kansas
HoldCo 1, Inc. is incorporated in the State of Delaware and Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation is incorporated
in the State of Nevada (collectively, the “U.S. Guarantors”).

**_Federal Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Issuer and Guarantors (together, the “Obligors”) may have operations that would be subject any one or more
of them either to proceedings under title 11 of the United States Code (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”) or any
applicable state law insolvency proceedings. Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a
debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy, subject to the rights of creditors
and other parties in interest to object and seek relief from the bankruptcy court. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code
provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to:

- the administration of a bankruptcy case, including (i) the imposition of the automatic stay, which immediately
stays all litigation, as well as most enforcement and other actions against the debtors or property of the
bankruptcy estate; (ii) provision of “adequate protection” to secured creditors to protect against diminution
of value of their collateral; (iii) terms for the use, sale or lease of property; (iv) standards for obtaining
post-petition credit; and (v) rules regarding the treatment of executory contracts and unexpired leases;

- creditors and claims, including deadlines and requirements for filing proofs of claim, the priority and
allowance of claims, and subordination of claims; and

- creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and ability to bring turnover
and avoidance actions, provisions relating to liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the filing of ancillary and other cross-border
insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor’s
assets by a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court and typically results in the immediate shutdown of the
debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to continue to operate

331


-----

their business as a going concern while they reorganize their businesses and resolve their obligations to creditors
(although a liquidation or sale under chapter 11 is also possible), in each case pursuant to a plan of reorganization
or liquidation, as applicable. Unlike in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case the debtor
typically remains in possession of its assets and continues to operate its business during the course of the
bankruptcy case (subject to the supervision of the bankruptcy court), with substantially the rights that a trustee
would otherwise have. In addition, “liquidating” chapter 11 cases may be used as an alternative to a liquidation
under chapter 7, particularly in an instance when the debtor seeks to maintain the “going-concern value” of its
business and/or expects to sell all or substantially all of its assets free and clear of liens during the course of the
bankruptcy case.

Because bankruptcy proceedings are often fact specific and vary case-by-case, and because bankruptcy courts are
courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code that could affect the Notes, and/or the guarantees and security is not contained herein. Furthermore, the
common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary
is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction.

With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (e.g., assignments for the benefit of
creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms), the effect on creditors in these proceedings are
fact-specific, vary from state-to-state, and require an examination of both statutory and common law, the details
of which also are not described herein. To the extent more information is required, potential investors in the Notes
should consult an insolvency professional familiar with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the applicable state
insolvency laws.

**_Automatic Stay_**

The right of a holder of the Notes to enforce its guarantee or security interests against the Obligors upon the
occurrence of an event of default under Indenture is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable U.S.
bankruptcy law if one or more of the Obligors became a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before
such guarantee or security interest were enforced. Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, creditors are prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from commencing or
prosecuting any litigation against the debtors or the property of the bankruptcy estate that was or could have been
commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding and from taking any action to obtain
possession of or exercise control over property of the bankruptcy estate. The automatic stay could be lifted or
modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, including the lack of “adequate protection” of
an interest in property of the debtor, but parties may object to any creditor request to lift or modify the automatic
stay, and the bankruptcy court could deny such a request. The automatic stay ordinarily does not bar suits against
non-debtor guarantors or co-obligors.

**_Right of debtor-in-possession to remain in control of collateral and the bankruptcy process_**

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its
property and is authorized to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession”, subject to certain
limitations. This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a
liquidation case under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in
default under the applicable instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its
interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It
may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief,
in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a
result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay. The
type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to the circumstances. A bankruptcy
court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate protection for a diminution in
the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures. Likewise, the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code generally does not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees with
respect to unsecured or undersecured claims.

Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a plan of reorganization unless the debtor fails to
file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan within the first
180 days of the case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day period could be
extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20

332


-----

months after a chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other parties such as secured creditors would
be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans.

In consideration of the automatic stay, the lack of precise definition of the term “adequate protection”, the
exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of the bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

- whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its rights;

- the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed
or confirmed; or

- whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of
value of any collateral through the provision of “adequate protection.”

**_A Debtor-in-possession may obtain new credit secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens_**

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an extension
of new credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts
and circumstances, authorize the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is
secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens. In other words, it is possible that in connection with a
chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be permitted to incur new debt
that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11 filing.

**_Ability to confirm a chapter 11 plan notwithstanding the dissenting votes of creditors_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can be imposed on a creditor or equity holder (or class of
creditors or equity holders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive
treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the adjustment or
extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type with other claims or interests
that are substantially similar. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan, but still entitled to
some distribution under the plan, may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are
unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interests that
receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to reject it.

A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if more than one-half in number of claims holders and two-thirds
in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the
dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired
classes reject the plan, it may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the
“cram-down” provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so long as the plan (i) does not discriminate unfairly and
(ii) is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not
accepted, the plan. This could allow the debtor or other plan proponent to confirm its plan notwithstanding the
plan’s non-acceptance by one or more dissenting classes.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance
laws, the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes, the issuance of guarantees and the grant of security
interests, whether now or in the future, by the Obligors could be avoided, including under circumstances in which
a bankruptcy is not involved, if, among other things, at the time the Obligors incurred the obligations, issued the
related guarantee or gave the security, the Obligors (i) intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future
creditor; or (ii) (A) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such
indebtedness or the grant of such security interests and (B):

- were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence or grant of security;

- were engaged in a business or transaction for which the Obligors’ remaining assets constituted unreasonably
small capital; or

- intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as they
mature.

333


-----

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending on the law applied
in any proceeding with respect to an alleged fraudulent transfer or conveyance. Generally, a U.S. Obligor would
be considered insolvent if:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than all of its assets, at a fair valuation;

- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable
liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or

- it could not pay its debts as they become due.

There can be, however, no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency determinations
and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues.

If a court were to find that the issuance of a guarantee or security interest was a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent
conveyance, the court could void the guarantee or security interest, subordinate the payment obligations under
such guarantee or security agreement to the existing and future indebtedness of the Obligor or require the holders
of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the guarantee or security interest. In the event of a
finding that a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance occurred, there may be no payment made in respect of
the affected guarantees. In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a U.S. bankruptcy case with
respect to fraudulent transfers and fraudulent conveyances, claims in respect of liens or obligations evidenced by
guarantees may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Preference_**

Any future grant of security in favor of the Notes, including pursuant to security documents delivered after the
date of the Indenture, as applicable, might be avoidable in a U.S. bankruptcy case by the grantor (as
debtor-in-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a preference if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if (i) the grantor is insolvent at the time of the grant, (ii) the security interest permits the
holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the bankruptcy case were a case under chapter 7 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the security had not been given and (iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the grantor is
commenced within 90 days following the grant, or in certain circumstances, a longer period.

**_Reduction of Guarantees_**

The guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that the Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under
applicable law. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on the
amount of other obligations of such Guarantor. Furthermore, under the circumstances discussed more fully above,
a court under applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee
or subordinate it to all other obligations of the Guarantor.

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon
the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee
issued by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests, the burden of which exceeds the benefit to
the company or which is entered into within a certain period prior to insolvency or bankruptcy, may not be valid
and enforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the trustee or insolvency administrator
in the case of an insolvency of a Guarantor may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that
the applicable court may determine the guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event that any guarantees are
deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee
obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor,
including trade payables of such Guarantor.

**Switzerland**

**_Limitations on Guarantees granted by any Swiss subsidiaries_**

One of the Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Switzerland (the “Swiss Guarantor”). The granting of a
guarantee, indemnity, security or other benefit as well as any other undertaking contained in any agreement having
the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set-off or subrogation rights or the
subordination of intra-group claims, granted by the Swiss Guarantor for the benefit of the Swiss Guarantor’s direct
and indirect parent or sister companies (so-called “Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations”) are subject to certain

334


-----

restrictions and risk being held invalid or partially invalid under Swiss corporate law. Therefore, the Indenture
and/or any other relevant document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will contain certain limitation language
in relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations of the Swiss Guarantor, in order to enable the Swiss Guarantor
to grant guarantees securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating such restrictions under Swiss law
and to protect management from personal liability; such “limitation language” is standard market practice for,
amongst others, indentures, guarantees and security documents in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in
Switzerland in the form of a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or Swiss limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung).

Limitations on the enforcement of any guarantee and/or indemnity granted by the Swiss Guarantor apply in
relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations. The ability of the Swiss Guarantor to assume Upstream/
Cross-stream Obligations is restricted under Swiss law insofar as such Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations must
be within the corporate purpose and interests of the Swiss Guarantor and must not result in a repayment of the
share capital (Einlagerückgewähr/Kapitalrückzahlung), a violation of legally protected reserves (gesetzlich
_geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) or other non-permitted_
distribution of assets to shareholders, board members or other persons close to the Swiss Guarantor. In light of
the foregoing, the Indenture and/or any other relevant document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will limit
the amount of claims under any Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations assumed by the Swiss Guarantor to its freely
distributable equity at the time of enforcement. Freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum amount that
the Swiss Guarantor is permitted to distribute to its shareholders as a dividend payment under Swiss law at such
time. Presently, the freely distributable equity capital is equal to the balance sheet profits, and any reserves
available for distribution (minus, without double counting, any freely disposable equity that has to be blocked for
any loans granted by the Swiss Guarantor to a direct or indirect parent company of the Swiss Guarantor or a direct
or indirect subsidiary of any parent company pursuant to applicable Swiss corporate law and applicable accounting
standards) at the time or times at which payment in relation to Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations is requested.

In addition, the enforcement of any Guarantee granted by the Swiss Guarantor with respect to
Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations may give rise to Swiss withholding taxes (of up to 35% at present rates,
subject to applicable double taxation treaties) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of such Guarantee is
regarded as a deemed dividend distribution. Under Swiss law, any obligation of the Swiss Guarantor to gross-up,
indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax may
not be valid and, thus, may prejudice the enforceability of anything to the contrary contained above under
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” or in the Indenture or any other documentation related to the
Notes. In addition, any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for
the deduction of Swiss withholding tax in connection with any Guarantee granted by the Swiss Guarantor with
respect to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations would in any case be limited by the amount of the freely
distributable equity of the Swiss Guarantor. Further, the granting and/or enforcement of any Guarantee with
respect to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed,
including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

The Indenture and/or any other relevant documents to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will expressly provide
substantially as follows:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, the obligations of any Guarantor
incorporated in Switzerland (a “Swiss Guarantor”) and the rights of any holder of a Note, the trustee or the
Security Agent under this Indenture or the Notes are subject to the following limitations:

(i) if and to the extent that a Swiss Guarantor is liable under this article or any other provision of this
Indenture or of the Notes for obligations other than its own obligations or obligations of one of its direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries and that complying with such obligations would constitute a
repayment of capital (Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich
_geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) by such Swiss_
Guarantor (the “Swiss Restricted Obligations”), the aggregate liability of such Swiss Guarantor for
Swiss Restricted Obligations shall be limited to maximum amount of the Swiss Guarantor’s freely
disposable shareholder equity (the “Swiss Available Amount”) at the time such Swiss Guarantor is
required to perform the relevant obligation under the Indenture or the Notes, provided that this is a
requirement under applicable law at that time and further provided that such limitation shall not free such
Swiss Guarantor from its obligation in excess thereof, but merely postpone the performance date
therefore until such times as performance is again permitted notwithstanding such limitation. This Swiss
Available Amount of freely disposable shareholder equity shall be determined in accordance with Swiss
law and applicable Swiss accounting principles, and, if and to the extent required by applicable Swiss

335


-----

law, shall be confirmed by the auditors of the Swiss Guarantor on the basis of an interim audited balance
sheet as of that time;

(ii) immediately after having been requested to perform Swiss Restricted Obligations under the Indenture or
the Notes, such Swiss Guarantor shall:

(A) perform the Swiss Restricted Obligations which are not affected by the above limitations; and

(B) in respect of any remainder, if and to the extent requested by the Security Agent or required
under applicable Swiss law then in force, provide the Security Agent with an interim balance
sheet audited by the statutory auditors of such Swiss Guarantor setting out the Swiss Available
Amount and, immediately thereafter, pay the Swiss Available Amount (less, if required, any
Swiss Federal Withholding Tax) to the Security Agent to the extent not already covered by the
preceding sub-paragraph (ii)(A);

(iii) in respect of Swiss Restricted Obligations, each Swiss Guarantor shall:

(A) if and to the extent required by applicable law in force at the relevant time:

(1) subject to any applicable double tax treaties, deduct tax levied pursuant to the Swiss
Federal Withholding Tax Act ((Bundesgesetz über die Verrechnungssteuer vom 13
_Oktober 1965, SR 642.21) together with the related ordinances, regulations and_
guidelines, all as amended and applicable from time to time (the “Swiss Federal
**Withholding Tax”)) at the rate of thirty five percent (35%) (or such other rate as is in**
force at that time) from any payment made by it in respect of Swiss Restricted
Obligations;

(2) pay any such deduction to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration; and

(3) notify and provide evidence to the Security Agent that the Swiss Federal Withholding
Tax has been paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration; and

(B) to the extent such deduction is made, not be required to make a gross-up, indemnify or otherwise
hold harmless any holder of a Note, the trustee or the Security Agent for the deduction of the
Swiss Federal Withholding Tax, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Indenture or the Notes, unless such payment is permitted under the laws of Switzerland then in
force. Each Swiss Guarantor shall use its best efforts to ensure that any person which is, as a
result of a payment under the Indenture or the notes, entitled to a full or partial refund of the
Swiss Federal Withholding Tax, will, as soon as possible after the deduction of the Swiss Federal
Withholding Tax, (1) request a refund of the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax under any
applicable law (including double tax treaties) and (2) pay to the Security Agent upon receipt any
amount so refunded;

(iv) each Swiss Guarantor shall, and its parent shall procure that such Swiss Guarantor will, take and cause
to be taken any action, including, without limitation, the passing of any shareholders’ resolution to
approve any payment or other performance under this Indenture or the Notes and the receipt of any
confirmation from such Swiss Guarantor’s auditors, which may be useful or required as a matter of Swiss
mandatory law in force at the time it is required to make a payment or perform any other obligation under
this Indenture or the Notes in order to allow a prompt payment and performance of obligations by the
Swiss Guarantor under this Indenture or the Notes with a minimum of limitations; and

(v) if the enforcement of Swiss Restricted Obligations would be limited due to the effects referred to in this
section, then such Swiss Guarantor shall to the extent permitted by applicable law write up or realize any
of its assets that are shown in its balance sheet with a book value that is significantly lower than the
market value of the assets, in case of realization, however, only if such assets are not necessary for such
Swiss Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig) and make payments based on the then Swiss
Available Amount in accordance with this section.

The above sub-paragraph (iii)(B) is without prejudice to the gross-up, indemnification or other hold harmless
obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than a Swiss Guarantor) under the Notes, the Notes Guarantee
or this Indenture.

**_Overview of Swiss Insolvency Proceedings_**

In the event of the insolvency of the Swiss Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Switzerland and
Swiss insolvency laws would govern those proceedings. In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws
may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests over assets located in Switzerland. The
insolvency laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and
Bankruptcy Act (DEBA, Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) may be less favorable to the interests
of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability
to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability
of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws. Under these rules, claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of a
bankruptcy proceeding (Konkursverfahren) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets and liabilities of a Swiss
debtor. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge must follow a special enforcement
proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have
agreed that general debt enforcement proceedings and/or a private liquidation are permissible. However, if
bankruptcy is declared while such a special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the
creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no longer
permitted.

The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in force.
Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the
assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each
entity has, from a Swiss insolvency law point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in
particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each
entity have to be dealt with separately.

Under Swiss insolvency laws, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex_
_officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings._
Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate law in the event of
over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency laws in the
event that the debtor has obviously and permanently stopped to pay its debts as and when they fall due or has
acted fraudulently, or is attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may
also initiate insolvency proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally,
pursuant to Swiss corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which
must be assessed pursuant to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations and on the basis of a
balance sheet to be drawn up immediately upon the debtor’s board of directors having serious reason to believe
that the debtor is over-indebted (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s assets and (ii)—to the extent
there is still a going concern scenario—based upon the going concern value. If the interim balance sheet shows
that the creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued at liquidation values nor at going concern values,
the debtor’s board of directors has to notify the bankruptcy court, provided that (i) creditors of the debtor do not
agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the over-indebtedness and (ii) there is no serious
ground to admit that the over-indebtedness can be cured in time, but in any event at the latest within ninety days
since the interim balance sheets have been drawn up (Article 725b Swiss Code of Obligations). However, as soon
as the debtor loses the going concern assumption for accounting purposes, going concern values become irrelevant
and over-indebtedness is assessed solely based on liquidation values. While the criterion of over-indebtedness is
based on a balance sheet test (rather than a liquidity test), it is important to note that a debtor’s inability to pay its
debts as and when they fall due will cause the debtor to lose the going concern assumption for accounting purposes
and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation values. This, in turn, will typically result in over-indebtedness.
The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to file for bankruptcy at the latest within ninety days since the interim
balance sheets have been drawn up and non-compliance with this obligation exposes the board of directors to both
damage claims and (in extraordinary cases) sanctions under criminal law. The debtor’s board of directors need
not file for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in an aggregate amount no lower than the amount of the debtor’s
over indebtedness subordinate their claims against the claims of all other creditors, or (ii) if there is a substantiated
likelihood for an informal (i.e., out of court) workout at the latest within ninety days since the interim balance
sheets have been drawn up. Finally, the debtor’s auditors have the obligation to notify the competent court if the
debtor’s board of directors has failed to file for insolvency despite the debtor being obviously over indebted.

If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings it has to file an application for commencement of
enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office (Betreibungsamt).
With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located where the debtor is registered or
resident. The debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is

337


-----

no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor may within ten days upon having been served with
the writ of payment, file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual
stay of proceedings. No reasons need to be given for the objection. The debt collection office notifies the creditor
of the objection.

For claims based on an enforceable judgment, the creditor can without any further delay file an application to lift
this stay with the court (Rechtsöffnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an enforceable judgment, but on a
certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional lifting of such stay can be applied for in
summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung). In the event the objection is set aside in these summary
proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an action in ordinary court proceedings for a negative
declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist (Aberkennungsklage).

The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to continue the enforcement proceeding
(Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent debt
collection office delivers a continuation threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung) to the debtor. The insolvency
court may take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and
required to secure the creditor’s rights. After 20 days from receipt of the threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung)
the creditor may petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. The competent insolvency court decides upon
the insolvency without any delay, provided that there are no reasons which would lead to a suspension of the
insolvency court’s decision. In addition, the debtor has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The parties
may file an appeal against any decision taken by the insolvency court.

The insolvency court orders the continuation of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met, in
particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the
debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order to continue insolvency proceedings
if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the insolvency proceedings themselves. In the absence
of such advancement, the insolvency proceedings will be closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des
_Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the insolvency office may request the insolvency court to_
resolve upon summary insolvency proceedings (summarisches Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient
to cover the cost of ordinary insolvency proceedings and the actual facts of the case are not complicated.
Furthermore, in such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary insolvency proceedings.

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and dispose over
the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office has
full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) provided that certain acts
require the approval of the insolvency court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency
administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In
such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate
(Konkursmasse). The creditors’ committee has additional competences.

Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for those secured
by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon the opening of formal
bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy claim
consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not interest bearing), interest accrued thereon
until the date of insolvency, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon insolvency, interest ceases to accrue. Only
secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the collateral is
realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such interests.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing
to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings in Switzerland. Swiss
insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual
claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with, and subject to, the restrictions of Swiss
insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the
insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights
(Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such security interest is vested with the insolvency
administration.

Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to
certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the
claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors.

338


-----

Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency
proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency
claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied pursuant to the
distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, such
as a debtor’s employees. Certain privileges can further result for the Swiss government and its subdivisions based
on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent
there are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) after the security interests and privileged claims
have been settled and paid in full.

As an alternative solution to insolvency, the debtor (or, under certain circumstances, a creditor) may seek a
composition with creditors (Nachlassverfahren) by applying to the competent composition court
(Nachlassgericht) for a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) and submitting, besides other documents, a tentative
reorganization plan. The court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium provisionally (provisorische
_Stundung) for a maximum period of up to four months or not. With its decision the court appoints a commissioner_
provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). In case circumstances would justify it, the competent composition
court (Nachlassgericht) may withhold a public announcement of the granting of the provisional moratorium,
provided third party interests are well protected. In such case, (i) the creditors and other authorities will not be
notified, (ii) debt collection proceedings may still be initiated or further pursued (unless challenged by the debtor)
and (iii) a provisional commissioner (provisorischer Sachwalter) must be appointed in all circumstances. In case
it is obvious that there are no chances for a successful reorganization of the company or a composition agreement
(Nachlassvertrag), the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht), acting on its own motion, opens
insolvency proceedings over the debtor. In case the moratorium has been granted provisionally (provisorische
_Stundung) and in case during the period of the provisional moratorium a reorganization of the company or a_
composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a time before the provisional moratorium has
expired, the court approves the moratorium definitely (definitive Stundung) and appoints a commissioner
(Sachwalter). The court may, where deemed necessary, also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss)
for the purpose of supervising the commissioner. The commissioner convokes a meeting of creditors
(Gläubigerversammlung) which has to approve the draft composition agreement according to specific majority
rules. The composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is subject to the approval of the composition court. The
Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) provides for three different types of composition
agreements: the ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag), the composition agreement with
assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) and the composition agreement in insolvency
proceedings (Nachlassvertrag im Konkurs). During a definitive moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot
be initiated and pending proceedings are stayed. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to
manage its affairs is restricted. In case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private
liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the
settlement only for the amount of its claim not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect the
agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon
adjudication). However, a debtor may, subject to consent by the commissioner (Sachwalter), terminate long-term
agreements (Dauerschuldverhältnisse) (other than employment agreements) without notice (even if notice periods
apply under the agreement as such), provided (i) the continuation of the long-term agreement
(Dauerschuldverhältnis) would impede or at least seriously challenge the intended financial recovery and
(ii) provided the counterparty to such long-term agreement (Dauerschuldverhältnis) is held harmless (it being
understood that the respective claim would be a claim in the composition proceeding (Nachlassforderung)).
Interest payments will be stopped for unsecured claims during the moratorium (unless otherwise explicitly
provided in the composition agreement). The moratorium aims at facilitating a rehabilitation of the debtor under
protection of the court or the conclusion of one of the above composition agreements. Any composition agreement
needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the
composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the
composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims.
Privileged claims must be paid in full.

**_Collateral and Guarantee under Swiss Law_**

Generally, any guarantee governed by Swiss law is enforced in accordance with its terms under Swiss law.
Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of Article 111 Swiss Code of Obligations are
typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative.

Other security interests (rights in rem) are enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security
agreement. Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of the
secured parties to enforce the security interest either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off

339


-----

of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss
Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA), in which case the right of objection pursuant to
Article 41 of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) (Einrede der Betreibung auf
_Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security agreements. In such case, the parties also typically agree in_
advance that a private sale (Freihandverkauf) will be admissible.

In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may acquire any or
all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In case of an assignment of claims for security purposes, the security
agent will, on behalf of the secured parties, collect all assigned claims. Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell
such assigned claims to third parties by way of a private sale (Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for
its own account, in each case without having to initiate proceedings under the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement
and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA).

After an insolvency has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar security rights
are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by the insolvency
administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public
auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i)
enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy
unsecured creditors.

Under Swiss law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and
the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third
parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes will not be party to the security documents
relating to the collateral. In order for the holders of the Notes to benefit from “accessory” security interests and
have a secured claim, the security documents and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a
“parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each
amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by Swiss law will directly secure the parallel
debt. However, the parallel debt concept has not been tested in court under Swiss law, and there is no certainty
that it will be recognized and held valid and enforceable under Swiss law.

**_Avoidance actions under Swiss law_**

Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administration and certain creditors may, under certain conditions,
avoid transactions, such as, inter alia, the granting of, or the payment under, any guarantee or security interest or,
if a payment has already been made under the relevant guarantee and/or security interest, require that the recipients
return the amount received to the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). In particular, a transaction (which term includes
the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security interest and the payment of debt) that is detrimental to the
debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts
result in damages to the creditors:

- The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any consideration,
provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets
(Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a
consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of
the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the
burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the transaction, who must in this case prove that such
transaction was at arm’s length.

- Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment
of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at
that time: (i) granting of security interest for already existing claims, provided that the debtor was not
previously obliged to grant such security interest, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any
way other than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment
of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is excluded if the beneficiary of the transaction can
prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the
debtor had been over-indebted at that time.

- Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, _inter alia, the opening of formal_
insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment
of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) performed by the debtor with the intention to

340


-----

disadvantage its creditors, or discriminate some creditors against others or to favor some creditors to others
are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence must have been known, to the
debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party,
including, without limitation, a group company, the burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the
transaction, who must in this case prove that such intention was not recognizable.

If any guarantee or security interest is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason,
the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee and/or any security interest and would
have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions
that have been avoided would have to be repaid.

###### REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE

 Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements
 Opinion
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
 Basis for opinion
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
 Other information
 The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” thereon.

###### Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
 In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
 Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements
 The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
 Responsibilities of the réviseur d'entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
 The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
 As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
 statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.


-----

###### — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
 procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

 — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
 accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

 — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis
 of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
 statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
 entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
 Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
 The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 2022

**(1)** **Corporate information**

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. with registered office at 488, route de Longwy in L-1940 Luxembourg
(hereafter “the Company”, “the CABB Group”) was established on May 9, 2014 as a public limited
liability company and was registered on May 22, 2014 in the commercial register of Luxembourg under
number B 187114. The Company’s sole shareholder is Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., Luxembourg, an
entity which is beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds.

CABB Group is a global Crop Science CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization)
and Life Science company, supplying tailor-made customised active ingredients to leading
manufacturers of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. We also offer high-complexity and high-purity
specialised chemical ingredients to multiple customers in the Life Science markets. In November 2021,
the business was reorganised into a new corporate structure, which transferred the two former business
units "Custom Manufacturing" and "Acetyls" into a fully integrated organisation, "One CABB". Focusing
on a group-wide product portfolio under a “One CABB” organisation managing sales, procurement,
production and administration, will position the company to provide better services to its customers,
lead to better sales opportunities and higher overall efficiencies, thus accelerating CABB’s growth.

Our varied product portfolio is organised across two product groups: (i) Exclusives and Specialties
products, and (ii) Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products.

Exclusives are active ingredients customised for individual customers operating in the Crop Science
industry and are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides and range from pilot scale to
large-volume commercial production scale.

Specialities consist of proprietary ingredients and target market segments with high customer value add
and growth potential. These include a variety of end market applications including starting materials for
innovative pharmaceuticals, actives for cosmetics, building blocks for nutrition supplements and food &
beverage ingredients as well as applications e.g. for the automotive and aerospace industries. Our
products are based on our differentiating technology platforms and our deep understanding of customer

In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, we offer intermediate and base
chemical products, such as monochloroacetic acid ("MCA") and other chloride-based products, that
serve as chemical building blocks for other secondary chemical processes with a variety of applications
in various industries and end markets. MCA is a key building block for organic synthesis of ingredients
in various segments and end-markets and is provided in different purity grades (incl. ultra-pure and high
pure) as well as trade forms (incl. flakes, solution and others) Base Products such as caustic soda and
hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA, which are used in several
end markets including the broader chemicals space, pulp and paper, alumina, soap, detergents and
others.

**(2)** **Principles of preparing the consolidated financial statements**

The consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. for the year ended December 31,
2022 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
endorsed by the European Union valid on the reference date and in accordance with the Luxembourg
legal and regulatory requirements. All IFRSs and pronouncements of the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) which are binding for the financial year 2022 have been
applied as endorsed by the European Union.


-----

The consolidated financial statements of the CABB Group are drawn up in euros. Except where
otherwise indicated, amounts are stated in thousands of euros (kEUR) and rounded to the nearest
thousand. Adding individual figures may therefore not always result in the exact total given.

The consolidated financial statements were prepared and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors
on March 10, 2023.

**_New standards and interpretations adopted by the Group_**

With effect from January 1, 2022, we applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations
published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The amendments had no material
impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations:

- Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37
_Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS_
2018 – 2020.

The amendments to IFRS 3 include an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework in
IFRS standards. Furthermore, an additional provision was added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer
must apply the provisions from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when
identifying assumed liabilities within the scope of these standards.

The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items
produced while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognised
with the associated costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not
permissible.

The amendments to IAS 37 specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling
a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments apply
for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 to contracts existing at the date
when the amendments are first applied. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of
applying the amendments is recognised as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or
other components of equity, as appropriate. The comparatives are not restated.

The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial
Instruments, whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and
vice versa are to be included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities.
Costs or fees paid to other third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor
amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 41
_Agriculture, and to the explanatory examples of IFRS 16 Leases._

The following IFRSs and their interpretations are not yet in force in 2022 but already issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They were reviewed and are explained below, CABB
currently assumes that they will have no material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and
does not plan to early adopt these amendments.

- Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current
_or Non-current. The amendments pertain to a limited modification of the relevant criteria used to_
classify liabilities as current or noncurrent. They specify that the classification of liabilities as current
depends on the company’s rights as of the balance sheet date to postpone settlement of the liability
by a minimum of 12 months after the end of the reporting period. If such rights exist, the liability is
classified as noncurrent. Otherwise, it is classified as current. Classification is irrespective of
management’s expectations and of possible events after the balance sheet date. It also specifies
that settlement of a liability is defined as the repayment of liability using cash, other economic
resources or a company’s own equity instruments. The IASB issued a further amendment on July
15, 2020 whereby the date of initial application of the amendment on classification of liabilities will
be postponed by one year to January 1, 2024.


-----

- IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including amendments to IFRS 17. On March 18, 2020, the IASB
decided to postpone the date on which IFRS 17 will enter into force to fiscal years beginning on or
after January 1, 2023. The amendment was issued on June 25, 2020. IFRS 17 was issued on May
18, 2017, provides requirements on recognition, remeasurement and presentation of insurance
contracts within the scope of the standard and will replace IFRS 4.

- Amendments to IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements_ and IFRS Practice Statement 2 –
Making Materiality Judgements. The amendments to IAS 1 _Disclosure of Accounting Policies_
requires that only material accounting policies shall be disclosed in the notes in the future.
Accounting policy information is material if it relates to material transactions or events and there is
a reason to consider materiality (for example a change in accounting policy). The guidelines in IFRS
Practice Statement 2 were accordingly adjusted. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal
year beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

- Amendments to IAS 8 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._ The
amendments issued on February 12, 2021, clarify how entities can better distinguish between
changes resulting from changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. For
this purpose, accounting estimates are defined as “monetary amounts in financial statements that
are subject to measurement uncertainty”. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year
beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

- Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments require companies to recognise deferred
tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible
temporary differences. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2023.

- Amendments to IFRS 10 IAS 28 _Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its_
_Associate or Joint Venture. The IASB has postponed the mandatory effective date of its 2014_
Amendments indefinitely.

- Amendments to IFRS 16 _Leases. The amendments impact how a seller-lessee accounts for_
[variable lease payments that arise in a sale-and-leaseback transaction. The amendments introduce](https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/news/2022/09/iasb-issues-narrow-scope-amendments-to-requirements-for-sale-and-leaseback-transactions/)
a new accounting model for variable payments and will require seller-lessees to reassess and
potentially restate sale-and-leaseback transactions entered into since 2019. The amendments are
to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2024.

We are currently reviewing the impact of the application of those standards on the consolidated financial
statements, which are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s reporting.

**_Use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements_**

The extent of the assets, liabilities and provisions, contingencies and other financial obligations shown
in the consolidated financial statements depends to a certain extent on estimates or assumptions.
These are based on the circumstances and assessments prevailing on the balance sheet date, and
accordingly also influence the amount of the income and expenses shown for the respective financial
periods. Such assumptions relate to the definition of the useful lives of depreciable fixed assets or
intangible assets, the measurement of provisions and other assets or obligations. Due consideration is
given to factors of uncertainty for the purpose of establishing the values; however, actual results may
differ from the original estimates.

Areas which are particularly complex or in which extensive estimates are necessary or in which the
estimates or assumptions which have been made have a major impact on the consolidated financial
statements are explained under “Estimates and assumptions” in section (3) (z) of these notes.


-----

**_Impact of COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine_**

We do not currently see any material negative impact of COVID-19 on our business operations and
thus the Group’s financial position or results of operations.

In the financial year 2022, Russia and Ukraine accounted for less than1 % of our Group Revenues.
Group sales and earnings, as well as the financial position and results of operations were only
marginally impacted by the war and its direct consequences in 2022.

We did not register any increase in past-due receivables in Russia or Ukraine. Based on a risk analysis
conducted at the level of individual customers, no impairments were recognised for expected losses.

Energy supply and global supply chains may also continue to be disrupted as a result of COVID-19 and
the war. Energy costs rose by around 58.9% (€ 24.3 million) year over year in 2022. They accounted
for 11.6% of the total cost of goods sold in the financial year 2022.

CABB’s direct exposure with regards to potential gas shortages is minimal. We’ve realigned our
processes and are furthermore advancing the implementation of programs to save energy.

At the same time, we are expanding our supplier network and building up additional inventories where
appropriate.

The higher inflation caused by the developments mentioned above and the associated rise in interest
rates had, among others, an impact on the measurement of pension provisions (see note (26)) and
financial expenses (see Note (17).

Higher interest rates were also considered in the impairment test of our Goodwill, intangible assets (see
note (18)) and property, plant and equipment (see note (19)), but did not lead to impairment charges.

**(3)** **Accounting policies and valuation methods**

The consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. have been prepared on the historical
cost basis except for derivative financial instruments measured at fair value and except for provisions
for pensions and similar obligations that are measured at present value of the defined benefit obligation
less fair value of plan assets.

**a)** **Scope of consolidation**

The scope of consolidation is based on the application of IFRS 10. According to IFRS 10, a group
consists of a parent entity and the subsidiaries controlled by the parent. “Control” of an investee
assumes the simultaneous fulfilment of the following three criteria: (1) the parent company holds
decision-making power over the relevant activities of the investee (2) the parent company has rights to
variable returns from the investee and (3) the parent company can use its decision-making power to
affect the variable returns.

**b)** **Balance sheet date**

The financial statements of the consolidated companies are prepared as of the balance sheet date of
the consolidated financial statements (December 31).

**c)** **Uniform valuation**

The assets and liabilities of the integrated companies included in the consolidated financial statements
are recognized and valued uniformly, in accordance with the principles described in this document.


-----

**d)** **Business combination**

A business combination is recognised at the time control over the subsidiary is obtained by the group
(acquisition date) using the acquisition method. The first step is to measure all identifiable assets
acquired and (contingent) liabilities assumed with their fair values at the acquisition date. The group
recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate
share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The consideration transferred is
netted with the proportionate revalued shareholders’ equity which has been acquired. Any differences
which result from this process are capitalised as goodwill and are written down only in the event of an
impairment. If the proportionate amount of the acquisition of net assets measured at fair value exceeds
the consideration transferred of the business combination, the identification and valuation of the
identified assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired company as well as the
measurement of the consideration transferred of the business combination are reassessed. Any
difference remaining after the reassessment is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. The
acquisition-related costs incurred for carrying out a business combination are recognised in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred.

**e)** **Eliminations**

Internal balances and transactions within the Group as well as gains and losses from internal
transactions within the Group are eliminated as parts of the process of preparing the consolidated
financial statements.

**f)** **Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the
management of CABB Group that makes strategic decisions.

**g)** **Foreign currency translation**

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in thousand Euros. Items included in the financial
statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).

In the financial statements of the individual Group companies, transactions in foreign currency are
translated into the respective functional currency using the spot rate prevailing on the dates of the
transaction. Monetary items which are not denominated in the functional currencies of the subsidiaries
are translated on the balance sheet date using the rate applicable at the end of the year. The resulting
currency gains and losses are recognised directly in the financial result.

The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the Euro are translated using
the year-end reference date rate into the reporting currency (Euro), which is also the functional currency
of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. Expenses and income are translated using the rates on the dates of the
transactions approximated by the average rates. All cumulative differences resulting from the currency
translation of the shareholders’ equity of foreign subsidiaries attributable to changes in the exchange
rates are shown directly in other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange rate differences arising
are recognised in other comprehensive income.


-----

For the main currencies in the Group, the following exchange rates have been used based on 1 Euro:

**Average exchange** **Exchange** **Average exchange** **Exchange**

**rate** **rate on the** **rate** **rate on the**

**2022** **Dec. 31, 2022** **2021** **Dec. 31, 2021**

Swiss Francs 1.005 0.985 1.081 1.033
US Dollar 1.054 1.068 1.183 1.132
Chinese Yuan Renminbi 7.090 7.378 7.630 7.189

**h)** **Revenue recognition**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised in the amount of the consideration the Group
expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services when the customer obtains control of the
goods or services. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the
goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them.

CABB primarily generates income from the sale of goods. Within the product group “Exclusives and
Specialities”, revenue from specific customer contracts is recognised over time. In these cases CABB’s
performance obligation consists in the creation of an asset without an alternative use to CABB and
CABB has an enforceable right to payment for the performance obligation completed to date. These
contractually enforcable rights are recognised and disclosed within ‘Accounts receivable, trade’ if
already shipped, or otherwise within ‘Contract assets’. The valuation of the related revenues is
performed by using the output method. The produced chemicals are valued by the agreed sales price
and any other parts allocated based on the overall amount of chemicals to be produced under the
respective contracts.

Certain customer contracts within the product group ‘Exclusives and Specialties’ provide for nonrefundable capital expenditure fees, paid by the customer at the beginning or during the project. These
advance payments are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in proportion to the
performance used by the customer during the contract period (output method). The outstanding
performance obligation is disclosed in the balance sheet at each reporting date. It is possible that the
performance obligation at a given point in time is in a contract asset or a contract liability position.

If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a
specific point in time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognised at a specific point in
time. Determination of the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the goods occurs in the
context of an overall assessment of the circumstances which considers the existence of a present claim
to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks
and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer of risks and rewards takes into account the
underlying terms of delivery (especially Incoterms) and is of particular practical significance. According
to these principles, sales revenue from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery.

Payment terms depend on the customer’s creditworhhiness and range from cash in advance to longer
payment terms.

**i)** **Cost of sales**

Cost of sales comprises the costs of materials, personnel expenses, proportionate depreciation and
amortisation, repairs and maintenance, energy, analysis and ecology, production overheads, plant
overheads as well as costs of packaging the products.

**j)** **Distribution and logistics expenses**

Distribution and logistics expenses comprise the costs of personnel expenses, proportionate
depreciation on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as transport costs.


-----

**k)** **Research and development**

Research costs are recognised immediately as expense when they are incurred. They comprise wages
and salaries, cost of materials, proportionate depreciation on property, plant and equipment and
overheads. Development costs are only capitalised if, on the basis of various criteria, it is probable that
the capitalised amount will be covered by future income.

**l)** **Financial result**

This item contains interest income and expenses as well as foreign currency gains and losses. Interest
income and expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method.

**m)** **Borrowing costs**

The process of the acquisition, construction or production of intangible assets or property, plant and
equipment does not cover a period of more than one year. Accordingly, no borrowing costs have been
capitalised as part of the costs of purchase or production costs.

**n)** **Goodwill**

Goodwill arises in business combinations and represents the excess of the consideration transferred,
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any
previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

Goodwill is only written down in the event of an impairment. The value of goodwill is subject to an annual
impairment test and is also reviewed if there is any indication of an impairment. The goodwill impairment
test is performed based on cash-generating units (CGUs) by comparing the recoverable amount with
the carrying amount.

The following three cash generating units have been identified: (i) European contract development and
manufacturing organisation (European-CDMO), comprising CABB AG, Pratteln (Switzerland) and
CABB Oy, Kokkola (Finland); (ii) US contract development and manufacturing organisation (USCDMO), comprising Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation, Galena, Kansas (USA); (iii) Non-contract
development and manufacturing organisation (Non-CDMO), comprising CABB GmbH, Gersthofen
(Germany), CABB North America Inc., Huntersville/NC (USA), CABB Jinwei Specialty Chemicals
(Jining) Co. Ltd. (PRC) and CABB Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., Shanghai (PRC). These three CGUs
reflect the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management
purposes.

The carrying value of the CGUs containing goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is
the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised
immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

**o)** **Intangible assets**

Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill as well as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life,
are measured at cost of purchase less accumulated straight-line depreciation and eventually less
accumulated impairment losses. The respective useful life is the length of the underlying agreement
and the probable utilisation of the potential use of the intangible asset.

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognised if the recoverable amount
is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and the value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). If the reasons
for an impairment are no longer applicable, corresponding write-ups are recognised. Depending on the


-----

type of the intangible asset, depreciation is shown under Costs of sales, Distribution and logistics
expenses, Research and development expenses or General and administrative expenses.

A European Community law concerning chemicals and the reliable handling of chemicals came into
force on June 1, 2007. This law governs the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of
chemicals (REACH). REACH requires the registration of certain substances. The companies of the
CABB Group incur costs within the framework of this registration procedure. These costs are capitalised
as intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 _Intangible Assets, and are depreciated over their_
estimated useful life of twelve years using the straight-line method.

Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method. The average periods of amortisation are
as follows:

**Amortisation on intangible** **in years**
**assets**

Capitalised REACH costs 12
Customer relations 5 - 20
Technology 5
Software 3

**p)** **Government grants**

Government grants related to the acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment reduce
the acquisition or construction cost of the respective assets and are recognised in porift or loss as the
asset is depreciated or amortised. Other government grants or government assistance are recognised
immediately as other operating income or treated as deferred income and released over the underlying
period.

**q)** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost of purchase or cost of production less
accumulated depreciation recognised over the standard useful life and eventually less accumulated
impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of
the items. The costs of production of an asset comprise the directly attributable costs as well as
reasonable amounts of material and production overheads. The revaluation method is not used.

Each item of property, plant and equipment with a significant purchase value in relation to the overall
value of the asset is depreciated separately. If a significant item of property, plant and equipment has
a useful life and a depreciation method which are identical to those applicable for another part of the
same asset, these parts are combined for the purpose of determining the depreciation cost.

Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. Land is not depreciated.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each reporting year.

The average periods of depreciation are as follows:

**Depreciation on property,** **in years**
**plant and equipment**

Buildings and improvements 12 - 40
Technical equipment, plant 5 - 15
and machinery

IT and other equipment 3 - 15
Vehicles 5 - 10

Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognised


-----

if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating
units). The assessment is made on the basis of the present value of the cash flows expected in the
future less the expected costs for removing an installation. Impairments are recognised in the amount
of the difference between the previous carrying amount and the discounted future cash flows. If the
reason for an impairment is no longer applicable, corresponding write-ups are recognised. Gains and
losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised within Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the consolidated statement of profit or
loss.

**r)** **Leases**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is,
or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period
of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at
the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less
any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straightline-method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use
asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on
the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically
reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot
be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: (a) fixed
payments, including in-substance fixed payments; (b) variable lease payments that depend on an index
or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) amounts expected
to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and (d) the exercise price under a purchase option that
the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group
reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless
the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a
change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee,
or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination
option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. From 1 January 2021, where the basis for determining
future lease payments changes as required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group remeasures
the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rate that reflects
the change to an alternative benchmark interest rate.

Leases in which CABB is a lessee mainly relate to transportation and technical equipment as well as
land and buildings. The corresponding right-of-use assets are included within ‘Property, plant and
equipment’ or ‘Other intangible assets’ and the lease liabilities within ‘Other (non-current/ current)
financial liabilities’ in the consolidated statement of financial position.


-----

The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases
that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets
and lease liabilities for low-value assets and recognises the lease payments associated with these
leases as an expense on straight-line basis over the lease term.

Lease contracts in which CABB acts as a lessor are exclusively operating leases, as these contracts
do foresee the transfer of substantially all risks and rewards of utilising the underlying assets to the
lessee. The leased assets continue to be capitalised, and the lease payments received are recognised
in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Details of the leases are set out in the Note (19).

**s)** **Financial instruments**

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in
the consolidated statement of financial position, when CABB becomes a party of a financial instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been
transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash
equivalents, and derivatives with positive fair values. Financial assets are recognised in the
consolidated statement of financial position when CABB becomes a party to a financial instrument.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which
the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. The amount at which a financial asset is initially
recognised comprises its fair value and in most cases the transaction costs.

The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow
condition (the “solely payments of principal and interest” criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow
characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model
used for managing financial asset portfolios. Based on these two criteria, the following measurement
categories are applicable:

_Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash_
flow are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition
established in IFRS 9. At CABB, derivatives are allocated to this measurement category, for example.
CABB does not generally exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of
financial instruments not to be measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow
condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances.

_Financial assets measured at amortised cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to_
cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest
on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow conditions in IFRS 9, to the extent
that the asset is held with the intention of collection the expected contractual cash flows over its term.
At CABB, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivables that are not eligible for
factoring, as well as miscellaneous assets and certain securities.

A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not a
FVTPL, transactions costs that are directly attributable to is acquisition or issue. A trade receivable
without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured amortised costs using the effective
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign
exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on
derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

Initial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value, which usually corresponds to the
transaction price at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement effects are recognized in income
using the effective interest method.


-----

Impairments are recognised for expected credit losses in both initial and subsequent measurement,
even before the occurrence of any default event for financial assets measured at amortised costs and
contract assets. If the counterparty is considered as having defaulted, an individual valuation allowance
is generally recognised for the financial assets measured at amortised cost. In addition, a write-off is
written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering the financial asset in its
entirety of a proportion hereof. The extend of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit
risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset
has increased significantly since initial recognition. If, however, the credit risk has not increased
significantly in this period, impairments are generally only recognised for the 12-month expected credit
losses. By contrast, under the simplified approach for determining expected credit losses permitted by
IFRS 9, impairments for receivables such as trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime
expected credit losses of the receivable concerned.

The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than
30 days past due. At CABB, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal information
and external rating information on the respective counterparts. A significant increase in the
counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The
significance of the increase in the credit risk is not reviewed for trade accounts receivable. Furthermore,
it is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have
increased significantly. Regional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and
expectations are taken into account when assessing the need for a valuation allowance as part of the
calculation of expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances. In addition, CABB uses
internal and external ratings and the assessments of credit insurers, when available. Individual valuation
allowances are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks.
Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortised costs,
are likewise considered when calculating valuation allowances. Bank guarantees and letters of credit
are used to an immaterial extent. The valuation allowances for receivables whose insurance includes a
deductible are not recognised in excess of the amount of the deductible. A decrease in valuation
allowances due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event
occurring after the valuation allowance is recorded in profit or loss.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets measured at amortised cost are
credit impaired. This is the case if one or more events that have an impact on the estimated future cash
flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes
the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the debtor, a breach of contract such a
default or being more than 90 days past due; if it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or
other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of
financial difficulties. Loss allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The
gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations
of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For individual customers, the Group
has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 180 days past due
based on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets. The Group expects no significant
recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject
to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Financial assets are classified based on the group`s business model for managing the financial assets
and on their contractual cash flow characteristics. The carrying amounts of the trade receivables are
assumed to equal their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Due to the short
maturity of these receivables, the transaction price represents their fair value. Trade receivables sold
under the securitisation programme, as well as the related liabilities are recognized to the extent of the
credit risk retained (continuing involvement).

_Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include all assets with_
contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9,


-----

to the extent that the asset is not just held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash
flows of its term, but also generating cash flows from the sale of a portfolio. At CABB the eligible trade
receivables for factoring fulfil these criteria.

Assets measured at fair valued through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value,
which usually corresponds to the nominal value of the securities, allocated to its category at the time of
acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the time value are
recognised in other comprehensive income and the delta reclassified to the statement of income when
the asset is disposed of.

Impairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are
calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortised cost and
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The following measurement categories are used for financial liabilities:

_Financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided_
these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial
recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent
measurement is recognised in profit or loss at amortised cost using the effective interest method. At
CABB, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial liabilities are measured at
amortised cost.

_Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities._
These are likewise measured at the value of initial recognition. The latter also represents the
measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently
measure financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or has
expired.

Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial
instrument. If IFRS requires separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its
host contract and measured at fair value. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value
hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

###### • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

 • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset 

or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived form prices)

###### • Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data

(unobservable inputs)

CABB uses the following valuation technique for determining the fair values of financial assets and
financial liabilities:

Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded
in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present
value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

This valuation technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and relies
as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair
value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the
same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
measurement.


-----

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred. There were no transfers between the different levels of
fair value hierarchies in the financial reporting periods ended December 31, 2021, and December 31,
2022.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the
amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, such contracts did not exist.

**t)** **Taxes**

The current taxes on income are calculated using the current or substantively enacted tax rate in relation
to the taxable income of the individual group companies. Management establishes provisions in
situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation as appropriate on the basis of
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

The deferred taxes on income are accrued on the basis of the current or substantively enacted local
tax rate expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income
tax liability is settled. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all
temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the
tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of
goodwill. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from
investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in
the forseeable future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary
difference can be utilised.

A combined tax rate of 24.94% is used in Luxembourg. Country-specific tax rates are used for the other
companies.

Deferred tax assets resulting from losses carried forward and temporary differences are only recognised
if it is probable that these can be offset against future taxable profits.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised as tax expenses, unless they relate to items which have
been recognised directly as other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if they have the same maturity, if there is
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and if they are due
in relation to the same tax authority by the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there
is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**u)** **Inventories**

Inventories are carried at cost of purchase or cost of production. Cost is determined using moving
average value. If net realisable values are lower, inventories are recognised at these lower values. The
net realisable value is equivalent to the sales proceeds attainable in the normal course of business,
less the directly attributable costs up to the point at which the inventories are sold. Costs of production
comprise the directly attributable costs as well as reasonable amounts of material and production
overheads assuming a normal level of utilisation of the relevant production facilities to the extent that
they are incurred in connection with the manufacturing process. Costs of the Company’s pension
scheme, for social facilities of the operation and voluntary social benefits of the Company as well as
costs of administration are also taken into consideration to the extent that they are attributable to
manufacturing. Financing costs are not included in costs of production.

Raw materials and supplies, including technical material and packagings, are measured at the lower of
cost of purchase and net realisable value. A write-down is recognised to reduce the value of such raw
materials and supplies to a figure which is lower than the cost of purchase only if the net realisable


-----

value of the finished products which include the raw materials and supplies is probably lower than the
cost of production of the finished products.

**v)** **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
Provisions for pensions are based on actuarial computations made according to the projected unit credit
method, which applies, among others, the following valuation parameters: future developments in
compensation, pensions and inflation, the expected performance of plan assets, employee turnover
and the life expectancy of beneficiaries. The resulting obligations are discounted by reference to market
yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate fixed rate bonds with an AA rating that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Actuarial gains and losses resulting from periodic recalculation are recognised in other comprehensive
income. They result from the variance between the actual development in pension obligations and
pension assets and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year as well as the updating of
actuarial assumptions. The calculation of pension provisions is based on actuarial reports.

The current service costs which are associated with the work carried out in the reporting period are
shown as personnel expenses in the costs of those functions in which the employees are operating,
except when included in the cost of an asset. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit
obligation and the fair value of plan assets both at the beginning of the year. This cost is included in
financial expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee
benefit expense when they are due.

**w)** **Other provisions**

Other provisions are recognised if a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past
event, an outflow of economic resources is probable and the corresponding amount can be reliably
estimated. Provisions are recognised to the extent of the best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the present obligation.

Provisions are recognised for environmental protection measures and risks if, as a result of a past
event, there is a current legal or constructive obligation to carry out measures.

The probable settlement amount of non-current provisions is discounted, if the discounting effect is of
a material nature. In this case, the probable settlement amount is recognised with its present value. The
increase of the discounted amount resulting from the passage of time and the effect deriving from any
change in the discount rate are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income and classified as financial income or expense.

Provisions for service anniversary payments are mainly calculated in accordance with actuarial
principles. For semi-retirement agreements which have been concluded, the wage and salary payments
to be made during the passive phase of the semi-retirement arrangement are accumulated in
instalments, approved supplemental payments are accrued in instalments until the end of the exemption
phase at the latest.

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal
retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these


-----

benefits. The group recognised termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the
group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.

**x)** **Financial risk management**

CABB Group is exposed to numerous financial risks within its business activities. These risks comprise
market, credit, interest rate and exchange rate risks. For details, please refer to Note (35) (Financial
risk management).

**y)** **Estimates and assumptions**

The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with the IFRS requires
assessments, assumptions and estimates with regard to the application of accounting policies, and also
requires management to make assumptions regarding future developments. These assessments,
assumptions and estimates are based on experience and other factors which are considered to be
reasonable under the given circumstances. Actual outcomes and results within the next financial
periods may differ materially from current expectations. Hence, a change in the underlying estimates
and assumptions could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the affected asset or
liability.

Therefore, estimates and assumptions are continuously reviewed. Changes in accounting-relevant
estimates are recognised in the reporting period in which the assessment is revised, and also in future
reporting periods if these future reporting periods are affected by the revised estimates.

In particular, the following items in the consolidated statement of financial position have been affected
by the use of estimates:

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill resulting from the capital consolidation is recognised in the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2022 (see Note (18)). Goodwill has to be tested for impairment at
least once every year. For the purpose of the impairment test, long-term cash flow forecasts are to be
compiled for cash-generating units within the context of the expected development of the Group and
the overall economic trends. Estimates of cost of capital are used to determine the pre-tax discount rate
for discounting the cash flows. As these estimates are continuously reviewed, potentially possible
changes might require an adjustment to the carrying amount of the goodwill.

**_Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets_**

In the course of the purchase price allocation following the business combination with CABB Group,
items of property, plant and equipment (see Note (19)) and intangible assets (see Note (18)) were
measured at fair value. For this valuation an external expert was engaged. Management determined
the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement used by the
expert.

The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at
the end of each reporting period. These assets are tested once a year for indications of impairments. If
there are any such indications, estimates of the expected future cash flows from the utilisation and
potential disposal of these assets are made for assessing the impairment. The actual cash flows may
differ appreciably from the discounted future cash flows which are based on these estimates. Factors
such as a change in the planned utilisation of buildings, machinery and equipment, technical aging or
utilisation levels of installations which are lower than original forecasts may reduce the useful service
life or may result in an impairment.


-----

**_Pension provisions_**

The valuation of provisions for pensions and similar obligations is influenced by assumptions regarding
the future development of wages and salaries or pensions as well as discount rates.

In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst
Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension fund (Pensionskasse –
PK) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed
via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company, Ilmarinen, Finland.
The calculations of the liabilities recognised regarding these facilities are based on statistical and
actuarial calculations of the actuaries. In particular, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation
depends on assumptions such as the discount rate and the pension growth rate used for calculating
the present value of the future pension obligations. Future salary increases and increases in the other
benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of the future pension
obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by the Group also use statistical data such
as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions. The discount
rate for the actuarial calcuations of the German and Finnish defined-benefit obligations was determined
by applying the Mercer Pension Yield Curve Approach (MYC). The data and methodology used to
create the MYC is reviewed periodically by Mercer to ensure consistency and improved estimates.

**_Environmental provisions_**

The provision recognised for environmental protection measures (see Note (27)) represents the best
estimate of the expected outflow of funds. The provision relates to expected costs of rehabilitating toxic
waste sites in Switzerland as well as waste disposal at the production location in Kokkola. The future
development of environmental costs depends on many factors including the rehabilitation method to be
used, the extent of the rehabilitation measures as well as the shares attributable to the Group and to
external parties.

Due to uncertainties related to the prediction of environmental rehabilitation costs, it is possible that
additional costs may occur which exceed the recognised provision. Based on the latest available
information, management considers that the provision as of December 31, 2021 and December 31,
2022 are adequate.

**(4)** **Scope of Consolidation**

The scope of consolidation comprises Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., with registered office in Luxembourg,
as well as all domestic and international subsidiaries. Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. directly or indirectly
owns a majority of voting rights in these companies. There are no joint ventures or associated
companies.

In addition to Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. as the parent company, the consolidated financial statements
as of December 31, 2022 include three Luxembourg and fourteen non-Luxembourg companies in which
Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. exercises control and is therefore exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns
from its involvement with the entities and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over
the aforementioned entities.

The following table shows the share of capital held by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. as of December 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021:

**(5)** **Segment information**

On November 17, 2021, the Group announced a reorganisation of its group structure to become a fully
integrated contract development and manufacturing company under a centralised “One CABB”
organisation managing sales, procurement, production and administration. As part of the change, the
former business units Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls were combined into one and the internal
management reporting to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) was aligned accordingly in the
fourth quarter of the financial year 2021.

No operating segments have been aggregated in arriving at the reportable segments of the Group.

**a) Segment revenue**

The revenue from external parties reported to the chief operating decision maker is measured
consistent to the manner applied in the Consolidated statement of profit and loss and other
comprehensive income.

**kEUR** **2022** **2021**

**Revenue from external customers** 755,488 588,988

**b) Segment EBITDA**

In determining the segment result, CABB Group applies the same principles of recognition and
measurement as in the consolidated financial statements. The Group measures the performance of its
segment on the basis of a segment income variable referred to by Internal Control and Reportings as
“Adjusted EBITDA”. Interest income and expenses are not allocated to the segments as these are
managed by the central treasury function.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the net result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial
result, amortisation and depreciation, and adjustments for expenses and income not related to the
operational performance of the business activities, such as strategic projects, restructuring and
reorganisation measures, financial impacts of natural disasters, property damage insurance
compensations, as well as valuation impacts resulting from curtailments or modifications of pension or
post-retirement benefits schemes and purchase price allocations.

Depreciation -60,760 -54,080
Amortisation -27,270 -26,770
**Earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)** **74,400** **36,692**

In the first half of the financial year 2021, the Group's reported EBITDA was affected by severe winter
weather conditions on the Gulf Coast of the USA. These conditions caused many raw material suppliers
to declare force majeure for various products, such as Acetic Acid. This resulted in the loss of business
that had already been contracted through purchase orders. The negative financial impacts of this natural
disaster was not covered by insurance and was included in the Adjusted EBITDA as part of the
normalising adjustments.

**c) Segment Net Working Capital**

The amounts reported to CABB Group’s management with respect to Operating Net Working Capital
are measured in the same way as in the financial statements.

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2022** **Dec. 31, 2021**

**Operating Net Working Capital** **65,042** **57,193**

**Operating Net Working Capital** **65,042** **57,193**

**d) Segment additions to non-current assets**

Amounts provided to the management of the CABB Group for additions to non-current assets are
reported consistently with the consolidated statement of changes in non-current assets, except for
additions to non-current assets recognised in connection with IFRS 16 "Leases", which are therefore
not included in the following table:


-----

**kEUR** **2022** **2021**

**(6)** **Revenue from contracts with customers**

The Group generates revenues primarily from the sale of customised active ingredients, advanced
intermediates, diversified specialty chemicals with a strong focus on the agrochemicals industry.

**a) Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers**

In the following table, revenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by location of the
customer and timing of revenue recognition. The table also provides a reconciliation of the
disaggregated revenue with the Group’s reportable segments (see Note ((5) a)).

Over time 298,755 240,809
**Total revenue from external Customers** **755,488** **588,988**

Revenues within Europe mainly refer to Switzerland and Germany.

The Group derives revenues from three customers, which each account for more than 10 percent of
total Group Sales.

**b) Assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers**

The group recognised the following assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers:

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2022** **Dec. 31, 2021**

Contract assets relating to Exclusives 17,757 13,646
Expected credit losses -6 -1
**Total contract assets** **17,751** **13,645**

Contract liabilities relating to Exclusives 3,757 11,704
**Total contract liabilities** **3,757** **11,704**

Within the product group “Exclusives and Specialities”, revenue from specific customer contracts is
recognised over time. In these cases CABB’s performance obligation consists in the creation of an
asset without an alternative use to CABB and CABB has an enforceable right to payment for the
performance obligation completed to date. These contractually enforcable rights are recognised and
disclosed within ‘Accounts receivable, trade’ if already shipped, or otherwise within ‘Contract assets’.
The valuation of the related revenues is performed by using the output method. The produced chemicals
are valued by the agreed sales price and any other parts allocated based on the overall amount of
chemicals to be produced under the respective contracts.

Certain customer contracts within the product group ‘Exclusives and Specialties’ provide for nonrefundable capital expenditure fees, paid by the customer at the beginning or during the project. These
advance payments are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in proportion to the
performance used by the customer during the contract period (output method). The outstanding


-----

performance obligation is disclosed in the balance sheet at each reporting date. It is possible that the
performance obligation at a given point in time is in a contract asset or a contract liability position. The
weighted-average expected remaining term of the contract liabilities as of December 31, 2022 is 2.16
years (2021: 2.0 years).

If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a
specific point in time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognised at a specific point in
time, generally upon delivery.

In the financial year 2022, the Group recognised revenues of kEUR 9,525 (2021: kEUR 4,483), related
to contract liabilities recognised at the previous balance sheet date.

Other interest expenses increased to kEUR 6,791 (2021: kEUR 6,059), mainly due to the amortisation
of transaction costs related to the bonds, which amounted to kEUR 4,797 in the financial year 2022
(2021: kEUR 4,500). Additionally, higher interest expenses were incurred in conjunction with the net
working capital financing programs and the revolving credit facility.

**(16) Taxes on income**

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A., Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. in liquidation, and
CABB Nordic Holding S.à r.l. are subject to a corporate income tax rate of 17.0% in Luxembourg (2021:
17.0%). This results in a combined overall tax rate of 24.94% (2021: 24.94%), which includes a 7.0%
employment fund contribution/solidarity surtax on the corporate income tax rate and a 6.75% municipal
business tax on profits. As the Group operates in various tax jurisdictions worldwide, it is subject to
income taxes at rates ranging from 13.45% to 29.63% (2021: 18.0% to 29.71%).

Taxes on income for the financial year 2022 and 2021 are broken down as follows:

Non-deductible interest expenses predominately incur within the German and Finnish tax jurisdiction,
which limits the deductibility of interest expenses to 30.0% or 25.0% of the EBITDA defined for the
purpose of the interest rate cap regulation. The non-deductible portion of net interest expenses
amounted to kEUR 9,909 in the financial year 2022 (2021: kEUR 15,633). Although these amounts may
in principle be carried forward indefinitely and offset against future interest income, no deferred tax
assets in respect to interest tax loss carry-forwards in the amount of kEUR 135,658 (December 31,
2021: kEUR 125,737) were recognised, as the prerequisites for their usability will not be fullfilled within
the foreseeable future. Furthermore, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax
loss carry-forwards amounting to kEUR 22,111 (2021: kEUR 11,691), as it is not probable that sufficient
taxable profit will be available against which they may be utilised. Of these tax losses carried forward,
kEUR 5,962 (2021: kEUR 4,112) will expire within two years, kEUR 0 will expire in three years
(2021: kEUR 199) and kEUR 16,149 thereafter (2021: kEUR 7,380). In the financial year 2022, CABB
Jinwei Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co. Ltd., incurred a tax loss of kEUR 1,645. Based on the five-year


-----

business plan, management considers it probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which tax losses totalling kEUR 2,828 can be used and the Group recognised deferred tax assets of
kEUR 707 as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021:kEUR 1,575).

In conjunction with actuarial gains/ losses of defined-benefit plans, deferred income taxes amounting
to kEUR -1,685 (2021: kEUR -4,562) are included within other comprehensive income (OCI).

**Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test and is also reviewed if there is any indication of an**
impairment. The goodwill impairment test is performed on the basis of cash-generating units (CGUs)
by comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying amount.

Consistent with the internal management and reporting structure, the following three cash generating
units have been identified: (i) CDMO – Europe, (ii) CDMO – North America, (iii) Non - CDMO. The
CGUs reflect the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management
purposes. The existing goodwill was allocated to the CGUs in accordance with the purchase price
allocation in 2014 for the CGU CDMO – Europe and the CGU Non – CDMO resp. 2019 for the CGU
CDMO – North America.

The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is calculated based on the fair value less costs to
sell approach. The underlying cash flow projections are based on past experiences, current results and
on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. Market assumptions, such as the
development of the overall economy and the market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific information sources. The required discounting of cash flows for
impairment testing is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital rate after tax, which is
determined using the capital asset pricing model. It comprises a risk-free interest rate, a market risk
premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective industry-specific peer group. The fair
value measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair value. The financial projections were approved by
management and consist of a detailed planning period of five years.

The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2022. The recoverable amount of all
CGU’s exceed their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2021. No
goodwill impairment was indicated.

Trade receivables sold under a customer’s factoring programme totalled kEUR 10,927 as of December
31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 11,401).

Since June 2020, the Group sells without recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured
entity under an asset-backed securitisation programme. The financing volume is committed to a
maximum amount of kEUR 50,000. The structured entity is not controlled by CABB and therefore not
consolidated by the Group. The special purpose entity obtains its funding primarily from capital markets
through the issuance of commercial papers and has mandated the Group to service the receivables in
return for an at arm’s-length fee. The structured entity has the contractual right to terminate this service
agreement and may appoint as substitute servicer any other person. The Group transfers the
contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a revolving basis at their nominal
value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is presented as part of other
financial receivables and represents the Group’s right to receive this amount once the trade receivables
sold have been settled by the customers. To the extend to which the credit risk is retained by the Group
(continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and corresponding other financial liabilities are
recognised. The carrying amount of trade receivables transferred under the securitisation programme
amounted to kEUR 32,970 as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 24,288), of which
kEUR 32,175 have been derecognised (December 31, 2021: kEUR 23,662); and kEUR 6,751
(December 31, 2021: kEUR 3,325), representing the retained reserve, is presented as part of other
current financial receivables. The carrying amount of trade receivables (classified as trade receivables)
and the other financial liability resulting from the continuing involvement amounted to kEUR 795 as of
December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 626). See Note (34) and Note (35).

**(25) Equity**

The aim of capital management is to ensure financial flexibility for the long-term maintenance of
business operations and the exercise of strategic options. Securing liquidity and limiting financial risks
are objectives of financial policy and set important parameters for capital management. The responsible
corporate bodies decide on the target capital structure of the balance sheet, the appropriation of net
income and the amount of the dividend. Net financial debt is one of the most important indicators for
capital management.

**Share capital and share premium**

_Share capital_

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. was established on May 9, 2014, with a subscribed capital of EUR 1,000 with
a nominal value of EUR 1 and 1,000 fully paid in shares.

All ordinary shares rank equally with respect to the Company’s residual assets. Shareholders holding
these shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared by the Company from time to time and have
the right to cast one vote per share at the Company’s general meetings.

_Share premium_

The share premium results from a contribution in cash of kEUR 220,634 and non-cash contributions of
kEUR 71,170.

**Other Reserves**

_Contribution Reserve_

The contribution Reserve amounts to kEUR 11,376 and represents the difference between the
contribution amount of the equity investment in Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) as of October
7, 2019 (contribution date), and the nominal value of the Subscribed capital plus the Share premium of
Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg).

_Translation Reserve_

The translation reserve comprises all gains and losses arising from translating the financial statements
of subsidiaries outside the eurozone into the functional currency of the Group. This item will or might
be reclassified subsequently to profit and loss.

**Equity attributable to non-controlling interests**

Non-controlling interests reflect the 32.4% share in CABB - Jinwei Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co.
Ltd., Zhanghuang Town (PRC), that is held by shareholders other than CABB.

On December 17, 2019, the shareholders of the Sino-foreign joint venture limited company decided the
conversion of certain portions of the shareholder loans into equity, as a consequence of which the equity
attributable to non-controlling interests increased by kEUR 8,172.

**(26) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

CABB Group provides its employees post-employment defined benefit plans. In Germany, retirement
benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss
employees of the Group are insured with the pension plan (Pensionskasse der CABB AG) of CABB
AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the
pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd., Ilmarinen (Finland).

The pension fund of CABB AG is organised as an independent registered trust (registrierte Stiftung)
and maintains a shift insurance plan and a regular pension plan. According to the deed of foundation,
the trust has the purpose to provide benefits to retired employees of CABB AG in the form of pension
payments for life and in case of disability or death within the framework of the Occupational Pension
Act (Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge BVG).
Alternatively, the employee can request a lump-sum payment of his accrued capital. The level of


-----

benefits provided depends in general on employees’ length of service and their salary for respective
service years.

According to the pension plan rules, the pension benefits are financed by contributions of the
employees, the employer and the fund. Art. 32 of the pension plan determines that in case the means
of the fund are insufficient to meet the defined contributions by the fund, those contributions have to be
made by the employer. Contributions to the Swiss pension fund are expected to remain stable in the
short to medium term as payments are based on fixed percentages of pensionable benefits. If there is
a funding shortfall, the Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) can implement measures including: changing
benefits, lowering the returns credited to employees and changing the conversion rate. If the measures
are not sufficient to improve the funding level, and as a last resort, the fund can ask the employer and
employees to make additional contributions to close the gap. CABB AG would then have to bear at
least half of any extra payments. Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans under IAS
19, as although contribution levels are in fact “fixed”, there is a potential risk of extra payments in future.

Basis for the investment of plan assets is the investment regulation of the foundation dated
December 10, 2013. This regulation ensures the compliance with Occupational Pensions Act (BVG)
and best possible return within acceptable risk profile. Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) and Investment
Commission (Anlagekommission) define the long term investment structure as well as objectives and
benchmarks for the investments. Only bonds with solid credit risk rating (at least "BBB-") are selected
for investments. At least 50% of all bond investments are made in bonds with rating of "AA-" and higher.
Investment guidance is reviewed on an annual basis. All persons involved in investment decisions for
plan assets or otherwise employed by the pension fund are subject to confidentiality obligations and
have to follow the ASIP (Swiss pension fund association) Charter.

The defined benefit plans in Finland, Germany and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to actuarial
risks such as:

- **Interest risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount**
rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in the bond
interest rate will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition the decrease in interest rate
will decrease interest expense; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on
the plan assets.

- **Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to**
the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An
increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation.

- **Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the**
future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will
increase the defined benefit obligation.

In addition, defined benefit plans in Finland and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to the
investment risk: Decrease in the fair value of plan assets can create a plan deficit.

In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is calculated using the
actuarial valuation method for current one-off premiums or in accordance with the projected unit credit
method on the basis of specific parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the
present value of the pension obligation to show the funded statuts of the obligation. The extent of the
obligation as well as the plan assets are determined at regular intervals of not more than twelve months;
in the case of all defined-benefit plans, they are calculated every year as of December 31.

Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling
are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation
are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits.

The following parameters have been used as the basis for determining the present value of the benefit
obligations as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 for the domestic and international
companies:


-----

Age- and gender-related fluctuation probabilities have been used.

The average duration of the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 is 10.5 years (December
31, 2021: 13.6 years).

The actuarial assumptions may differ from the actual results due to the change in market conditions
and economic climate, higher or lower retirement rates, longer or shorter lives of insured parties and
also other estimated factors. These differences can have an impact on the pension obligations
recognised in future reporting periods.

Amounts recognised in comprehensive income in respect of these defined benefit plans are as follows:

In the financial year 2022, negative past service costs totalling kEUR 1,677 were recognised due to the
change in a parameter (conversion rate) used to calculate the pension benefit obligation under the
Swiss pension scheme.

In the financial year 2022, the Group recognised losses on plan assets totaling kEUR 32,387 (2021:
gains of kEUR 16,462) due to an unfavorable development on the capital markets. Due to considerably
increased discount rates, the Group recognised actuarial gains arising from changes in financial
assumptions totaling to kEUR 47,638 (2021: gains of kEUR 9,071).

In the financial year 2021, the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability of the Swiss pension
plan resulted in a significant decrease in an amount of kEUR 39,084. This gain, which is included within
other comprehensive income, comprises the following components: (i) return on plan assets increased,
mainly driven by a higher market value of equity instruments, by kEUR 17,129. (ii) due to the mandatory
transition to new technical biometric principles, applied to calculate the pension funds' obligations (BVG
2020 GT; 2020: BGF 2015 GT), actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions were
recognised in an amount of kEUR 9,071. This was mainly driven by changes in the following biometric
parameters: increased churn rate of plan participants, a lower disability probability, a lower-thanexpected increase in the life expectancy and a decreased probability of leaving behind an eligible
partner upon the occurrence of the insured event. (iii) the discount rate increased from 0.15% p.a. in
the prior year to 0.3% p.a. in 2021, which resulted in an actuarial gain amounting to KEUR 3,724. (iv)
due to changes in the population of retirees and active employees, actuarial gains from experience
adjustments were recognised in an amount of kEUR 9,160.

The remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability is included in other comprehensive income.

The amount included in the consolidated statement of finanical position arising from the Group’s

In the financial year 2022, the total actual income from plan assets amounted to kEUR -31,485 (2021:
kEUR 16,968), thereof in Switzerland kEUR -25,041 (2021: kEUR 17,374) and in Finland kEUR -6,444
(2021: kEUR -406).

In 2022, additional employer contributions of kEUR 5,973 (2021: kEUR 5,230) were made into statutory
pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans).

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount
rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based
on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting
period, while holding all other assumptions constant:

- If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligaton would decrease
by kEUR 9,458 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 14,341) (increase by kEUR 11,628; December 31,
2021: kEUR 15,955).

- If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation
would increase by kEUR 8,918 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 13,080) (decrease by kEUR 7,092;
December 31, 2021: kEUR 12,194).

- If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would
increase by kEUR 541 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 980) (decrease by kEUR 562, December 31,
2021: kEUR 955).

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another
as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit
obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period,
which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the
statement of financial position.

The Group expects to make a contribution of kEUR 5,220 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 3,924) to the
defined benefit plans during the next financial year.

Provisions for environment and rehabilitation relate to the responsibility of the Group in relation to the
cost of asbestos remediation and the rehabilitating of legacy issues of three landfill sites in Switzerland
as well as waste disposal obligations in Finland. The rehabilitation costs are borne by the major waste
contributors of the past, whereby the share of CABB AG is defined in accordance with a fixed distribution
key. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of management for the future outflow of funds in
connection with the rehabilitation obligations. Although the estimations and assumptions are regularly
reviewed and updated, the actual outcome can significantly differ from the current best estimate. The
rehabilitation of the largest landfill site is completed, which leads to the next phase of renaturation of
the site.

Personnel obligations include short term employee benefits for holiday allowances and overtime
kEUR 4,486 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 3,671), premiums and bonus payments of kEUR 5,342
(December 31, 2021: kEUR 6,022), and service anniversary payments of kEUR 1,530

(December 31, 2021: kEUR 1,802) as well as post-employment benefits of kEUR 452 (December 31,
2021: kEUR 577). Other provisions mainly comprise provisions for other uncertain liabilities.

**(28) Notes**

The acquisition of the CABB Group was mainly financed by way of public Euro bonds which were issued
by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. in June 2014. On October 7, 2019, the
Group redeemed the existing indentures and issued the financial instruments described in the following.

The Senior Notes were issued by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., whereas the Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes were issued by Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. On the Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes, the interest is payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15
and December 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2020. On the Fixed Rate Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Notes, interest is payable semianually in arrears on March 15 and September 15
in each year, commencing on March 15, 2020.

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes are guaranteed on a general
senior secured basis by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., CABB Group GmbH, CABB Holding GmbH, CABB
GmbH, CABB Europe GmbH, CABB AG, CABB Nordic Holding S.à. r.l., CABB Finland Oy, CABB Oy,
Kansas HoldCo 1, Inc. and Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation. They are secured by first-ranking
security interests in the share capital of each of the guaranteeing CABB entities; certain material bank
accounts, intra-group loan receivables, certain material real estate owned by CABB AG and CABB Oy
and certain other assets of CABB Finland Oy, CABB Oy and Jayhawk.

The Senior Notes are guaranteed by the above mentioned CABB entities on a senior subordinated
basis. They are primarily secured by second-ranking security interests in the share capital of Monitchem
Holdco 3 S.A..

The Group may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due
2025 at any time after September 15, 2020; the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2025 on or after
September 15, 2021 and the Senior Notes due 2026 on or after September 14, 2022.


-----

Such early redemption options are reported as embedded derivatives. Upon certain events defined as
constituting a change of control the bond issuers are required to make an offer to purchase the
outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest.

The notes agreement defines certain covenants which, among other things, restrict the ability of the
bond issuers and their subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends,
redeem capital stock or make certain investments, transfer or sell certain assets, merge or consolidate
with other entities or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Certain covenants will be suspended
if the relevant notes obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating.

The notes are recognised at their aggregate principal amounts plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Transaction costs, which are amortised over the term of the notes, are deducted in an amount of
kEUR 13,753 as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 18,147).

The market value of the Notes and the market value of embedded derivatives in the indenture are
categorised as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

-----

No changes of fair value hierarchy took place in the shown financial years.

The following valuation techniques have been used for determining the fair values of financial assets
and financial liabilities:

- **Market comparison technique (i.e. Notes): financial instruments with standard terms and**
conditions which are traded on active markets are valuated based on broker quotes. Similar
contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transations in similar
instruments.

- **Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives): financial instruments that are not traded in an active**
market (for example: derivatives) are valuated considering the present value of expected future
cash flows based on observable yield curves.

- **Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of**
embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte Carlo
simulation. For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is
calibrated such that the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange (Bourse de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing
model also considers the risk-free interest rate as another paramater.

These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely
as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair
value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. There are no
financial instruments, which require a determination of fair values based on unobservable inputs
(level 3).

Derivative financial instruments (embedded derivatives in the indenture and interest rate swaps not
included in a designated hedging relationship) are categorised as “at fair value through profit or loss” in
accordance with IFRS 9. They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their
maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive
fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). The value of the embedded derivatives is
affected by the interest of the comparable market instrument on each potential exercise date and will
rise if the relevant interest rate declines and vice versa.

Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “at
amortised cost” under IFRS 9 as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly
have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference
date are approximately equivalent to the fair value.

Trade accounts receivable and other financial liabilities of the category “at fair value through other
comprehensive income” under IFRS 9 represent the credit risk retained by the Group with regards to
trade accounts receivable, which are sold under the securitisation programme (continuing involvement).

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the interest income and expense, the
amortisation of arrangement fees, bank fees and other fees, the result from the translation of foreign
currencies and other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line financial
instruments at fair value through profit and loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments
measured at fair value through profit or loss which are not designated as hedging instruments in
accordance with IFRS 9. No hedge accounting is applied.

**(35) Financial risk management**

The operations of the Group are exposed to liquidity, credit, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The
Group’s overall risk management seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial
performance. In November 2019, the Group joined a factoring contract of one of its customers, in the
course of which trade receivables due from a major customer are settled through a bank.

Since June 2020, the Group sells without recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured
entity under an asset-backed securitisation programme. The financing volume is committed to a
maximum amount of kEUR 50,000 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 30,000). The structured entity is not
controlled by CABB and therefore not consolidated by the Group. The special purpose entity obtains its
funding primarily from capital markets through the issuance of commercial papers and has mandated
the Group to service the receivables in return for an at arm’s-length fee. The structured entity has the
contractual right to terminate this service agreement and may appoint as substitute servicer any other
person. The Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on
a revolving basis at their nominal value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount
is presented as part of other financial receivables and represents the Group’s right to receive this
amount once the trade receivables sold have been settled by the customers. To the extend to which
the credit risk is retained by the Group (continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and
corresponding other financial liabilities are recognised. The carrying amount of trade receivables
transferred under the securitisation programme amounted to kEUR 32,970 as of December 31, 2022
(December 31, 2021: kEUR 24,288), of which kEUR 32,175 have been derecognised (December 31,
2021: kEUR 23,662); and kEUR 9,270 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 3,325), representing the retained
reserve, is presented as part of other current financial receivables. The carrying amount of trade
receivables (classified as trade receivables) and the other financial liability resulting from the continuing
involvement amounted to kEUR 795 as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 626).

**Foreign currency risks**

The Group is exposed to changes in exchange rates leading to losses in the value of financial
instruments. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing
rate of financial receivables, cash and financial liabilities including intercompany loans into the functional
currency of the respective consolidated entity. The foreign currency exposure corresponds to the net
amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments that are exposed
to currency risks.


-----

The Group has the objective to keep the risks from foreign currency at an acceptable level. It only
accepts the risks to the extent necessary to finance the foreign subsidiaries and to support the business
operations.

The following table shows the foreign currency exposure from financial instruments broken down by the
individual major currencies as of December 31, 2022. A reasonably possible 10% strengthening
(weakening) of the USD and CHF and RMB against all other currencies would have affected the
measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and affected equity and profit
or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest
rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases. As the derivatives
embedded in the Notes are denominated in EURO, no foreign currency exposure relating to the
functional currency of the Group exists.

**Total effect** **180,129** **-45,720** **134,409** **12,219**

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risks result from changes in prevailing market interest rates, which can cause a change in
the fair value of fixed-rate instruments, and changes in the interest payments of variable-rate
instruments. While these risks are relevant to the financing activities of the Group (long term notes),
they are not of significant importance for the Group’s operating activities.

Borrowings issued at variable interest rates exposes the Group cash flow interest rate risks. On October
7, 2019, the Group has refinanced the existing Floating Rate Notes by issuing Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes in an amount of kEUR 175,000. These notes bear a nominal interest rate equal to the 3
month EURIBOR plus 5.250%, whereby if the 3m EURIBOR is less than zero, such rate is deemed to
be zero. The Group did not enter into new interest rate swaps during the reporting period.

The following table shows the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments
and the exposure to the interest rate risk:

**Nominal amount**

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2022** **Dec. 31, 2021**

**Fixed-rate instruments**

The following sensitivity analysis shows the reasonably possible effects of a 1% increase or decline in
interest rates on the consolidated result after tax for the financial year 2022, while holding all other
variables (in particular foreign currency exchange rates) constant:

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2022** **Dec. 31, 2021**

1% increase in interest rates -547 -1,970
1% decrease in interest rates 2,801 3,113

**Credit risk**

A default risk of financial instruments arises if counterparties are not able to meet their payment
obligations, or are not able to meet these obligations in full. Cash and cash equivalents are only held
with selected banks and thus with contract partners which is rated at least BBB by S&P or Fitch or at
least Baa2 by Moody’s in order to limit this risk.

The risk attributable to trade accounts receivable or financial receivables is defined as the risk that
outstanding receivables are not settled on time or that they are not settled at all. A credit risk
management system operating on the basis of a globally applied credit policy ensures that credit risks
are constantly monitored and bad debts minimised. This policy, which applies to both new and existing
customers, governs the allocation of credit limits and compliance with those limits, individual analyses
of customers’ creditworthiness based on both internal and external financial and macro-economic
information, risk classification, and continuous monitoring of the risk of bad debts at the local level.
Collateral received (e.g. documentary letters of credit) and other safeguards include country-specific
and customer-specific protection afforded by credit insurance, confirmed and unconfirmed letters of
credit in export business, as well as warranties and guarantees. Furthermore, in certain cases downpayments and advance payments are agreed. As soon as receivables have reached the second
dunning level, the sales department is required to make clear payment agreements with the customer.
A dunning run is carried out every week. If a receivable reaches the third dunning level, further deliveries
are suspended until payment is actually received. We also monitor our key customer relationships at
the regional and global level. In case a contract partner becomes defaulted, all financial asset with this
counterparty are impaired.

The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that CABB Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated
with its financial liabilities. The Group’s approach to manage liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible,
that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due. The Group monitors and

###### REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE

 Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements
 Opinion
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2021, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2021 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
 Basis for opinion
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
 Other information
 The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the consolidated report including the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” thereon.

###### Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
 In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
 Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements
 The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
 Responsibilities of the réviseur d'entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
 The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
 As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
 statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.


-----

###### — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
 procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

 — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
 accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

 — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis
 of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

 — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
 statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

 — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
 entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
 Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
 The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 2021

**(1)** **Corporate information**

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. with registered office at 488, route de Longwy in L-1940 Luxembourg
(hereafter “the Company”, “the CABB Group”) was established on May 9, 2014 as a public limited
liability company and was registered on May 22, 2014 in the commercial register of Luxembourg under
number B 187114. The Company’s sole shareholder is Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., Luxembourg, an
entity which is beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds.

CABB Group is a global Crop Science CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization)
and Life Science company, supplying tailor-made customised active ingredients to leading
manufacturers of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. We also offer high-complexity and high-purity
specialised chemical ingredients to multiple customers in the Life Science markets. In November 2021,
the business was reorganised into a new corporate structure, which transferred the two former business
units "Custom Manufacturing" and "Acetyls" into a fully integrated organisation, "One CABB". Focusing
on a group-wide product portfolio under a “One CABB” organisation managing sales, procurement,
production and administration, will position the company to provide better services to its customers,
lead to better sales opportunities and higher overall efficiencies, thus accelerating CABB’s growth.

Our varied product portfolio is organised across two product groups: (i) Exclusives and Specialties
products, and (ii) Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products.

Exclusives are active ingredients customised for individual customers operating in the Crop Science
industry and are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides and range from pilot scale to
large-volume commercial production scale.

Specialities consist of proprietary ingredients and target market segments with high customer value add
and growth potential. These include a variety of end market applications including starting materials for
innovative pharmaceuticals, actives for cosmetics, building blocks for nutrition supplements and food &
beverage ingredients as well as applications e.g. for the automotive and aerospace industries. Our
products are based on our differentiating technology platforms and our deep understanding of customer
application requirements

In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, we offer intermediate and base
chemical products, such as monochloroacetic acid ("MCA") and other chloride-based products, that
serve as chemical building blocks for other secondary chemical processes with a variety of applications
in various industries and end markets. MCA is a key building block for organic synthesis of ingredients
in various segments and end-markets and is provided in different purity grades (incl. ultra-pure and high
pure) as well as trade forms (incl. flakes, solution and others) Base Products such as caustic soda and
hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA, which are used in several
end markets including the broader chemicals space, pulp and paper, alumina, soap, detergents and
others.

**(2)** **Principles of preparing the consolidated financial statements**

The consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. for the year ended December 31,
2021 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
endorsed by the European Union valid on the reference date and in accordance with the Luxembourg
legal and regulatory requirements. All IFRSs and pronouncements of the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) which are binding for the financial year 2021 have been
applied as endorsed by the European Union.


-----

The consolidated financial statements of the CABB Group are drawn up in euros. Except where
otherwise indicated, amounts are stated in thousands of euros (kEUR) and rounded to the nearest
thousand. Adding individual figures may therefore not always result in the exact total given.

The consolidated financial statements were prepared and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors
on March 3, 2022.

**_New standards and interpretations adopted by the Group_**

With effect from January 1, 2021, we applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations
published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The amendments had no material
impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations:

- Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39
_Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures,_
IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and IFRS 16 Leases (issued on August 27, 2020). Under the detailed
rules of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, modifying a financial contract can require the recognition of
a significant gain or loss in the income statement. The amendments from phase 2 of the Interest
Rate Benchmark Reform (issued on August 27, 2020) introduce a practical expedient, if a change
results directly from IBOR reform and occurs on an ‘economically equivalent’ basis. In these cases,
changes will be accounted for by updating the effective interest rate. A similar practical expedient
applies under IFRS 16 _Leases_ for lessees when accounting for lease modifications required by
IBOOR reform. The amendments also allow a series of exemptions from the regular, strict rules
around hedge accounting. For example, a company will not need to discontinue existing hedging
relationships because of changes to hedge documentation required solely by IBOR reform.
Therefore, when a hedged risk changes due to the benchmark reform, a company may update the
hedge documentation to reflect the new benchmark rate and the hedge may be able to continue
without interruption. New disclosure requirements apply providing information about (1) the nature
and extent of risks to which the company is exposed arising from financial instruments subject to
IBOR reform and how it manages those risks; can (2) the company’s progress in completing its
transition to alternative benchmark rates and how it is managing that transition. The amendments
apply retrospectively from January 1, 2021.

- Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases Relating to Coronavirus-related Rent Concessions beyond June
_30, 2021, issued by the Board in May 2020. The 2020 amendments introduced an optional practical_
expedient that simplifies how a lessee accounts for rent concessions that are a direct consequence
of COVID-19. Under that practical expedient, a lessee is not required to assess whether eligible
rent concessions are lease modifications, instead accounting for them in accordance with other
applicable guidance. The Board extended the availability of the practical expedient by 12 months
on March 31, 2021 and permits lessees to apply it to rent concessions for which any reduction in
lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before June 30, 2022. The 2021
amendments are applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it being
recognised in opening retained earnings. The disclosure requirements of Paragraph 28(f) of IAS
_Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors do not apply on initial application._

- Amendments to IFRS 4 _Insurance Contracts – Extensions of Temporary Exemption from_
_Application of IFRS 9. The amendments to IFRS 4 issued on June 25, 2020 are aligned with the_
two-year postponement of the date on which IFRS 17 will come into force to reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2023. They include an analogue extension of the temporary
exemption period for certain insurance companies from application of IFRS 9 – Financial
Instruments, requiring these insurance companies to apply IFRS 9 for the first time in fiscal years
beginning on or after, January 1, 2023.

The following IFRSs and their interpretations are not yet in force in 2021 but already issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They were reviewed and are explained below, CABB


-----

currently assumes that they will have no material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and
does not plan to early adopt these amendments.

- Amendments to IFRS 3 _Business Combinations,_ IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37
_Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS_
2018 – 2020. These amendments were issued on May 14, 2020 and will come into force on January
1, 2022. The amendments to IFRS include an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework
in IFRS standards. Furthermore, an additional provision will be added to IFRS 3 stating that an
acquirer must apply the provisions from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework
when identifying assumed liabilities within the scope of these standards. The content of the
accounting rules for business combinations will not change.

The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items
produced while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognised
with the associated costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not
permissible.

The amendments to IAS 37 specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling
a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments apply
for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 to contracts existing at the date
when the amendments are first applied. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of
applying the amendments is recognised as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or
other components of equity, as appropriate. The comparatives are not restated. The Group has
determined that all contracts existing at December 31, 2021 will be completed before the
amendments become effective.

The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial
Instruments, whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and
vice versa are to be included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities.
Costs or fees paid to other third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor
amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 41
_Agriculture, and to the explanatory examples of IFRS 16 Leases._

- Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current
_or Non-current. The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 on January 23, 2020. The amendments_
pertain to a limited modification of the relevant criteria used to classify liabilities as current or
noncurrent. They specify that the classification of liabilities as current depends on the company’s
rights as of the balance sheet date to postpone settlement of the liability by a minimum of 12 months
after the end of the reporting period. If such rights exist, the liability is classified as noncurrent.
Otherwise, it is classified as current. Classification is irrespective of management’s expectations
and of possible events after the balance sheet date. It also specifies that settlement of a liability is
defined as the repayment of liability using cash, other economic resources or a company’s own
equity instruments. The IASB issued a further amendment on July 15, 2020 whereby the date of
initial application of the amendment on classification of liabilities will be postponed by one year to
January 1, 2023.

- IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including amendments to IFRS 17. On March 18, 2020, the IASB
decided to postpone the date on which IFRS 17 will enter into force to fiscal years beginning on or
after January 1, 2023. The amendment was issued on June 25, 2020. IFRS 17 was issued on May
18, 2017, provides requirements on recognition, remeasurement and presentation of insurance
contracts within the scope of the standard and will replace IFRS 4.

- Amendments to IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements_ and IFRS Practice Statement 2 –
Making Materiality Judgements. The amendments were issued on February 12, 2021. The
amendments to IAS 1 _Disclosure of Accounting Policies_ requires that only material accounting
policies shall be disclosed in the notes in the future. Accounting policy information is material if it
relates to material transactions or events and there is a reason to consider materiality (for example


-----

a change in accounting policy). The guidelines in IFRS Practice Statement 2 were accordingly
adjusted. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1,
2023.

- Amendments to IAS 8 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._ The
amendments issued on February 12, 2021, clarify how entities can better distinguish between
changes resulting from changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. For
this purpose, accounting estimates are defined as “monetary amounts in financial statements that
are subject to measurement uncertainty”. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year
beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

- Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments issued on May 7, 2021 require companies
to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of
taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendments are effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

- Amendments to IFRS 10 IAS 28 _Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its_
_Associate or Joint Venture. The IASB has postponed the mandatory effective date of its 2014_
Amendments indefinitely.

We are currently evaluating the impact of the application of those standards according to the required
application date in the financial years 2022 to 2023 on the consolidated financial statements.

**_Use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements_**

The extent of the assets, liabilities and provisions, contingencies and other financial obligations shown
in the consolidated financial statements depends to a certain extent on estimates or assumptions.
These are based on the circumstances and assessments prevailing on the balance sheet date, and
accordingly also influence the amount of the income and expenses shown for the respective financial
periods. Such assumptions relate to the definition of the useful lives of depreciable fixed assets or
intangible assets, the measurement of provisions and other assets or obligations. Due consideration is
given to factors of uncertainty for the purpose of establishing the values; however, actual results may
differ from the original estimates.

Areas which are particularly complex or in which extensive estimates are necessary or in which the
estimates or assumptions which have been made have a major impact on the consolidated financial
statements are explained under “Estimates and assumptions” in section (3) z of these notes.

**(3)** **Accounting policies and valuation methods**

The consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. have been prepared on the historical
cost basis except for derivative financial instruments measured at fair value and except for provisions
for pensions and similar obligations that are measured at present value of the defined benefit obligation
less fair value of plan assets.

**a)** **Scope of consolidation**

The scope of consolidation is based on the application of IFRS 10. According to IFRS 10, a group
consists of a parent entity and the subsidiaries controlled by the parent. “Control” of an investee
assumes the simultaneous fulfilment of the following three criteria: (1) the parent company holds
decision-making power over the relevant activities of the investee (2) the parent company has rights to
variable returns from the investee (3) the parent company can use its decision-making power to affect
the variable returns.


-----

**b)** **Balance sheet date**

The financial statements of the consolidated companies are prepared as of the balance sheet date of
the consolidated financial statements (December 31).

**c)** **Uniform valuation**

The assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements for the companies which
have been integrated are recognised and valued uniformly in accordance with the principles described
in this document.

**d)** **Business combination**

A business combination is recognised at the time control over the subsidiary is obtained by the group
(acquisition date) using the acquisition method. The first step is to measure all identifiable assets
acquired and (contingent) liabilities assumed with their fair values at the acquisition date. The group
recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate
share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The consideration transferred is
netted with the proportionate revalued shareholders’ equity which has been acquired. Any differences
which result from this process are capitalised as goodwill and are written down only in the event of an
impairment. If the proportionate amount of the acquisition of net assets measured at fair value exceeds
the consideration transferred of the business combination, the identification and valuation of the
identified assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired company as well as the
measurement of the consideration transferred of the business combination are reassessed. Any
difference remaining after the reassessment is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. The
acquisition-related costs incurred for carrying out a business combination are recognised in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred.

**e)** **Business combination under common control**

A business combination involving entities under common control is a transfer of net assets or an
exchange of equity interests between entities or businesses, that are ultimately non-transitorilly
controlled by the same party both before and after the business combination. A transaction in which a
parent company contributes its ownership interests or the net assets of a wholly owned subsidiary to
the capital reserves of another subsidiary, falls into the definition of a business combination under
common control. A common-control transaction is similar to a business combination for the entity that
receives the net assets or equity interests. However, as there is no change in control of the net assets
from the perspective of the ultimate parent or the controlling shareholder level, such a transaction is not
governed by IFRS 3 and there is no other specific guidance in the IFRSs. Hence, management needs
to use judgement to develop an accounting policy, that provides relevant and reliable information in
accordane with IAS 8. Interpretation of IFRSs adresses the accounting for common control transactions
from the perspective of the entity that receives the net assets or equity interests and requires the
receiving entity to recognise the assets and liabilities transferred either at their fair value or at their
carrying amounts in the financial statements of the entity that transfers the net assets on the date of
transfer (‘predecessor value method’), rather than at fair value. The consolidated financial statements
for the combined group can then be prepared as a continuation of the accounting acquirer’s financial
statements, without the recognition of an additional goodwill, through a retrospective restatement of
comparative financial information, as if the combination had occured at the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented.

**f)** **Eliminations**

Internal balances and transactions within the Group as well as gains and losses from internal
transactions within the Group are eliminated as parts of the process of preparing the consolidated
financial statements.


-----

**g)** **Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the
management of CABB Group that makes strategic decisions.

**h)** **Foreign currency translation**

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in thousand Euros. Items included in the financial
statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).

In the financial statements of the individual Group companies, transactions in foreign currency are
translated into the respective functional currency using the spot rate prevailing on the dates of the
transaction. Monetary items which are not denominated in the functional currencies of the subsidiaries
are translated on the balance sheet date using the rate applicable at the end of the year. The resulting
currency gains and losses are recognised directly in the financial result.

The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the Euro are translated using
the year-end reference date rate into the reporting currency (Euro), which is also the functional currency
of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. Expenses and income are translated using at the rates on the dates of the
transactions approximated by the average rates. All cumulative differences resulting from the currency
translation of the shareholders’ equity of foreign subsidiaries attributable to changes in the exchange
rates are shown directly in other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

For the main currencies in the Group, the following exchange rates have been used based on 1 Euro:

Exchange rate Exchange rate

Average Average

Swiss Francs 1,0813 1,0334 1,0704 1,0811
US Dollar 1,1827 1,1318 1,1417 1,2273
Chinese Yuan Renminbi 7,6298 7,1891 7,8729 7,9839

**i)** **Revenue recognition**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised in the amount of the consideration the Group
expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services when the customer obtains control of the
goods or services. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the
goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them.

CABB primarily generates income from the sale of goods. Within the product group “Exclusives and
Specialities”, revenue from specific customer contracts is recognised over time. In these cases CABB’s
performance obligation consists in the creation of an asset without an alternative use to CABB and
CABB has an enforceable right to payment for the performance obligation completed to date. These
contractually enforcable rights are recognised and disclosed within ‘Contract assets’.

Certain customer contracts within the product group ‘Exclusives and Specialties’ provide for nonrefundable capital expenditure fees, paid by the customer at the beginning or during the project. These
advance payments are disclosed within ‘Contract Liabilities’ and recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss in proportion to the performance used by the customer during the contract
period. The outstanding performance obligation is disclosed in the balance sheet item ‘Contract


-----

liabilities’ at each reporting date. It is possible that the performance obligation at a given point in time is
in a contract asset or a contract liability position.

If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a
specific point in time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognised at a specific point in
time. Determination of the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the goods occurs in the
context of an overall assessment of the circumstances which considers the existence of a present claim
to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks
and rewards as well as customer acceptance.

The transfer of risks and rewards takes into account the underlying terms of delivery (especially
Incoterms) and is of particular practical significance. According to these principles, sales revenue from
the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery.

**j)** **Cost of sales**

Cost of sales comprises the costs of materials, personnel expenses, proportionate depreciation and
amortisation, repairs and maintenance, energy, analysis and ecology, production overheads, plant
overheads as well as costs of packaging the products.

**k)** **Distribution and logistics expenses**

Distribution and logistics expenses comprise the costs of personnel expenses, proportionate
depreciation on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as transport costs.

**l)** **Research and development**

Research costs are recognised immediately as expense when they are incurred. They comprise wages
and salaries, cost of materials, proportionate depreciation on property, plant and equipment and
overheads. Development costs are only capitalised if, on the basis of various criteria, it is probable that
the capitalised amount will be covered by future income.

**m)** **Financial result**

This item contains interest income and expenses as well as foreign currency gains and losses. Interest
income and expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method.

**n)** **Borrowing costs**

The process of the acquisition, construction or production of intangible assets or property, plant and
equipment does not cover a period of more than one year. Accordingly, no borrowing costs have been
capitalised as part of the costs of purchase or production costs.

**o)** **Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value
of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

Goodwill is only written down in the event of an impairment. The value of goodwill is subject to an annual
impairment test and is also reviewed if there is any indication of an impairment. The goodwill impairment
test is performed based on cash-generating units (CGUs) by comparing the recoverable amount with
the carrying amount.

Until the third quarter of the financial year 2021, the Group’s internal management reporting to the chief
operating decision maker (CODM) was structured by the following two business units (BU’s): (i) BU


-----

Custom Manufacturing (comprising CABB AG, Pratteln (Switzerland); CABB Oy, Kokkola (Finland) and
Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation, Galena, Kansas (USA)). (ii) BU Acetyls (comprising CABB
GmbH, Gersthofen (Germany), CABB North America Inc., Huntersville/NC (USA), CABB Jinwei
Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co. Ltd. (PRC) and CABB Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., Shanghai (PRC)).
Both business units were identified as cash-generating units constituting the lowest level within the
entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

On November 17, 2021, the Group announced a reorganisation of its group structure to become a fully
integrated contract development and manufacturing company under a centralised “One CABB”
organisation managing sales, procurement, production and administration.

As part of the change, the business units Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls were combined into one
and the internal management reporting to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) was adjusted
accordingly in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2021. Consistent with the new internal
management and reporting structure, the following three cash generating units have been identified: (i)
European contract development and manufacturing organisation (European-CDMO), comprising CABB
AG, Pratteln (Switzerland) and CABB Oy, Kokkola (Finland); (ii) US contract development and
manufacturing organisation (US-CDMO), comprising Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation, Galena,
Kansas (USA); (iii) Non-contract development and manufacturing organisation (Non-CDMO),
comprising CABB GmbH, Gersthofen (Germany), CABB North America Inc., Huntersville/NC (USA),
CABB Jinwei Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co. Ltd. (PRC) and CABB Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd.,
Shanghai (PRC). These three CGUs reflect the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes.

The carrying value of the CGUs containing goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is
the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised
immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

**p)** **Intangible assets**

Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill as well as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life,
are measured at cost of purchase less accumulated straight-line depreciation and eventually less
accumulated impairment losses. The respective useful life is the length of the underlying agreement
and the probable utilisation of the potential use of the intangible asset.

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognised if the recoverable amount
is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and the value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). If the reasons
for an impairment are no longer applicable, corresponding write-ups are recognised. Depending on the
type of the intangible asset, depreciation is shown under Costs of sales, Distribution and logistics
expenses, Research and development expenses or General and administrative expenses.

A European Community law concerning chemicals and the reliable handling of chemicals came into
force on June 1, 2007. This law governs the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of
chemicals (REACH). REACH requires the registration of certain substances. The companies of the
CABB Group incur costs within the framework of this registration procedure. These costs are capitalised
as intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 _Intangible Assets, and are depreciated over their_
estimated useful life of twelve years using the straight-line method.

Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method. The average periods of amortisation are
as follows:


-----

**q)** **Government grants**

Government grants related to the acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment reduce
the acquisition or construction cost of the respective assets and are recognised in porift or loss as the
asset is depreciated or amortised. Other government grants or government assistance are recognised
immediately as other operating income or treated as deferred income and released over the underlying
period.

**r)** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost of purchase or cost of production less
accumulated depreciation recognised over the standard useful life and eventually less accumulated
impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of
the items. The costs of production of an asset comprise the directly attributable costs as well as
reasonable amounts of material and production overheads. The revaluation method is not used.

Each item of property, plant and equipment with a significant purchase value in relation to the overall
value of the asset is depreciated separately. If a significant item of property, plant and equipment has
a useful life and a depreciation method which are identical to those applicable for another part of the
same asset, these parts are combined for the purpose of determining the depreciation cost.

Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. Land is not depreciated.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each reporting year.

The average periods of depreciation are as follows:

**Depreciation on property,** **in years**
**plant and equipment**

Buildings and improvements 12 - 40
Technical equipment, plant 5 - 15
and machinery

IT and other equipment 3 - 15
Vehicles 5 - 10

Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognised
if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating
units). The assessment is made on the basis of the present value of the cash flows expected in the
future less the expected costs for removing an installation. Impairments are recognised in the amount
of the difference between the previous carrying amount and the discounted future cash flows. If the
reason for an impairment is no longer applicable, corresponding write-ups are recognised. Gains and
losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised within Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the consolidated statement of profit or
loss.


-----

**s)** **Leases**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is,
or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period
of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at
the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less
any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straightline-method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use
asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on
the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically
reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot
be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: (a) fixed
payments, including in-substance fixed payments; (b) variable lease payments that depend on an index
or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) amounts expected
to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and (d) the exercise price under a purchase option that
the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group
reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless
the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a
change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee,
or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination
option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. From 1 January 2021, where the basis for determining
future lease payments changes as required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group remeasures
the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rate that reflects
the change to an alternative benchmark interest rate.

Leases in which CABB is a lessee mainly relate to transportation and technical equipment as well as
land and buildings. The corresponding right-of-use assets are included in within ‘Property, plant and
equipment’ or ‘Other intangible assets’ and the lease liabilities within ‘Other (non-current/ current)
financial liabilities’ in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases
that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets
and lease liabilities for low-value assets, and recognises the lease payments associated with these
leases as an expense on straight-line basis over the lease term.

Lease contracts in which CABB acts as a lessor are exclusively operating leases, as these contracts
do foresee the transfer of substantially all risks and rewards of utilising the underlying assets to the
lessee. The leased assets continue to be capitalised, and the lease payments received are recognised
in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Details of the leases are set out in the Note (19).


-----

**t)** **Financial instruments**

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in
the consolidated statement of financial position, when CABB becomes a party of a financial instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been
transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash
equivalents, and derivatives with positive fair values. Financial assets are recognised in the
consolidated statement of financial position when CABB becomes a party to a financial instrument.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which
the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. The amount at which a financial asset is initially
recognised comprises its fair value and in most cases the transaction costs.

The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow
condition (the “solely payments of principal and interest” criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow
characteristics of an individual financial asset.

On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset portfolios.
Based on these two criteria, the following measurement categories are applicable:

_Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash_
flow are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition
established in IFRS 9. At CABB, derivatives are allocated to this measurement category, for example.
CABB does not generally exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of
financial instruments not to be measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow
condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances.

_Financial assets measured at amortised cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to_
cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest
on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow conditions in IFRS 9, to the extent
that the asset is held with the intention of collection the expected contractual cash flows over its term.
At CABB, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivables that are not eligible for
factoring, as well as miscellaneous assets and certain securities.

A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not a
FVTPL, transactions costs that are directly attributable to is acquisition or issue. A trade receivable
without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured amortised costs using the effective
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign
exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on
derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

Initial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value, which usually corresponds to the
transaction price at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement effects are recognized in income
using the effective interest method.

Impairments are recognised for expected credit losses in both initial and subsequent measurement,
even before the occurrence of any default event for financial assets measured at amortised costs and
contract assets. If the counterparty is considered as having defaulted, an individual valuation allowance
is generally recognised for the financial assets measured at amortised cost. In addition, a write-off must
be recognised when the contractual conditions that form the basis for the receivable are changed
through renegotiation in such a way that the present value of the future cash flows decreases. The
extend of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit risk of a financial asset, as well as
any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since
initial recognition. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period, impairments
are generally only recognised for the 12-month expected credit losses. By contrast, under the simplified


-----

approach for determining expected credit losses permitted by IFRS 9, impairments for receivables such
as trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable
concerned.

The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than
30 days past due. At CABB, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal information
and external rating information on the respective counterparts. A significant increase in the
counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The
significance of the increase in the credit risk is not reviewed for trade accounts receivable. Furthermore,
it is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have
increased significantly. Regional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and
expectations are taken into account when assessing the need for a valuation allowance as part of the
calculation of expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances. In addition, CABB uses
internal and external ratings and the assessments of credit insurers, when available. Individual valuation
allowances are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks.
Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortised costs,
are likewise considered when calculating valuation allowances. Bank guarantees and letters of credit
are used to an immaterial extent.

Expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances are only calculated for those receivables
that were not covered by insurance or other collateral. The valuation allowances for receivables whose
insurance includes a deductible are not recognised in excess of the amount of the deductible. A
decrease in valuation allowances due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or
an objective event occurring after the valuation allowance is recorded in profit or loss.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets measured at amortised cost are
credit impaired. This is the case if one or more events that have an impact on the estimated future cash
flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes
the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the debtor, a breach of contract such a
default or being more than 90 days past due; if it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or
other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of
financial difficulties. Loss allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The
gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations
of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For individual customers, the Group
has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 180 days past due
based on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets. The Group expects no significant
recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject
to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Financial assets are classified based on the group`s business model for managing the financial assets
and on their contractual cash flow characteristics. The carrying amounts of the trade receivables are
assumed to equal their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Due to the short
maturity of these receivables, the transaction price represents their fair value. Trade receivables sold
under the securitisation programme, as well as the related liabilities are recognized to the extent of the
credit risk retained (continuing involvement).

_Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include all assets with_
contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9,
to the extent that the asset is not just held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash
flows of its term, but also generating cash flows from the sale of a portfolio. At CABB the eligible trade
receivables for factoring fulfil these criteria.

Assets measured at fair valued through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value,
which usually corresponds to the nominal value of the securities, allocated to its category at the time of
acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the time value are


-----

recognised in other comprehensive income and the delta reclassified to the statement of income when
the asset is disposed of.

Impairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are
calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortised cost and
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The following measurement categories are used for financial liabilities:

_Financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided_
these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial
recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent
measurement is recognised in profit or loss at amortised cost using the effective interest method. At
CABB, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial liabilities are measured at
amortised cost.

_Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities._
These are likewise measured at the value of initial recognition. The latter also represents the
measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently
measure financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or has
expired.

Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial
instrument. If IFRS requires separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its
host contract and measured at fair value. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value
hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

###### • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

 • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived form prices)

###### • Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs)

CABB uses the following valuation technique for determining the fair values of financial assets and
financial liabilities:

Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded
in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present
value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

This valuation technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and relies
as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair
value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the
same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
measurement.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred. There were no transfers between the different levels of
fair value hierarchies in the financial reporting periods ended December 31, 2020 and December 31,
2021.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the


-----

amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, such contracts did not exist.

**u)** **Taxes**

The current taxes on income are calculated using the current or substantively enacted tax rate in relation
to the taxable income of the individual group companies. Management establishes provisions in
situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation as appropriate on the basis of
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

The deferred taxes on income are accrued on the basis of the current or substantively enacted local
tax rate expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income
tax liability is settled. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all
temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the
tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of
goodwill. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from
investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in
the forseeable future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary
difference can be utilised.

A combined tax rate of 24.94% is used in Luxembourg. Country-specific tax rates are used for the other
companies.

Deferred tax assets resulting from losses carried forward and temporary differences are only recognised
if it is probable that these can be offset against future taxable profits.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised as tax expenses, unless they relate to items which have
been recognised directly as other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if they have the same maturity, if there is
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and if they are due
in relation to the same tax authority by the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there
is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**v)** **Inventories**

Inventories are carried at cost of purchase or cost of production. Cost is determined using moving
average value. If net realisable values are lower, inventories are recognised at these lower values. The
net realisable value is equivalent to the sales proceeds attainable in the normal course of business,
less the directly attributable costs up to the point at which the inventories are sold. Costs of production
comprise the directly attributable costs as well as reasonable amounts of material and production
overheads assuming a normal level of utilisation of the relevant production facilities to the extent that
they are incurred in connection with the manufacturing process. Costs of the Company’s pension
scheme, for social facilities of the operation and voluntary social benefits of the Company as well as
costs of administration are also taken into consideration to the extent that they are attributable to
manufacturing. Financing costs are not included in costs of production.

Raw materials and supplies, including technical material and packagings, are measured at the lower of
cost of purchase and net realisable value. A write-down is recognised to reduce the value of such raw
materials and supplies to a figure which is lower than the cost of purchase only if the net realisable
value of the finished products which include the raw materials and supplies is probably lower than the
cost of production of the finished products.

**w)** **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.


-----

Provisions for pensions are based on actuarial computations made according to the projected unit credit
method, which applies, among others, the following valuation parameters: future developments in
compensation, pensions and inflation, the expected performance of plan assets, employee turnover
and the life expectancy of beneficiaries. The resulting obligations are discounted by reference to market
yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate fixed rate bonds with an AA rating that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Actuarial gains and losses resulting from periodic recalculation are recognised in other comprehensive
income. They result from the variance between the actual development in pension obligations and
pension assets and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year as well as the updating of
actuarial assumptions. The calculation of pension provisions is based on actuarial reports.

The current service costs which are associated with the work carried out in the reporting period are
shown as personnel expenses in the costs of those functions in which the employees are operating,
except where included in the cost of an asset. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit
obligation and the fair value of plan assets both at the beginning of the year. This cost is included in
financial expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee
benefit expense when they are due.

**x)** **Other provisions**

Other provisions are recognised if a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past
event, an outflow of economic resources is probable and the corresponding amount can be reliably
estimated. Provisions are recognised to the extent of the best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the present obligation.

Provisions are recognised for environmental protection measures and risks if, as a result of a past
event, there is a current legal or constructive obligation to carry out measures.

The probable settlement amount of non-current provisions is discounted, if the discounting effect is of
a material nature. In this case, the probable settlement amount is recognised with its present value. The
increase of the discounted amount resulting from the passage of time and the effect deriving from any
change in the discount rate are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income and classified as financial income or expense.

Provisions for service anniversary payments are mainly calculated in accordance with actuarial
principles. For semi-retirement agreements which have been concluded, the wage and salary payments
to be made during the passive phase of the semi-retirement arrangement are accumulated in
instalments, approved supplemental payments are accrued in instalments until the end of the exemption
phase at the latest.

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal
retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The group recognised termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the
group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.

**y)** **Financial risk management**

CABB Group is exposed to numerous financial risks within its business activities. These risks comprise
market, credit, interest rate and exchange rate risks. For details, please refer to Note (35) (Financial
risk management).

**z)** **Estimates and assumptions**

The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with the IFRS requires
assessments, assumptions and estimates with regard to the application of accounting policies, and also
requires management to make assumptions regarding future developments. These assessments,
assumptions and estimates are based on experience and other factors which are considered to be
reasonable under the given circumstances. Actual outcomes and results within the next financial
periods may differ materially from current expectations. Hence, a change in the underlying estimates
and assumptions could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the affected asset or
liability.

Therefore, estimates and assumptions are continuously reviewed. Changes in accounting-relevant
estimates are recognised in the reporting period in which the assessment is revised, and also in future
reporting periods if these future reporting periods are affected by the revised estimates.

In particular, the following items in the consolidated statement of financial position have been affected
by the use of estimates:

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill resulting from the capital consolidation is recognised in the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2021 (see Note (18)). Goodwill has to be tested for impairment at
least once every year.

For the purpose of the impairment test, long-term cash flow forecasts are to be compiled for cashgenerating units within the context of the expected development of the Group and the overall economic
trends. Estimates of cost of capital are used to determine the pre-tax discount rate for discounting the
cash flows. As these estimates are continuously reviewed, potentially possible changes might require
an adjustment to the carrying amount of the goodwill.

**_Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets_**

In the course of the purchase price allocation following the business combination with CABB Group,
items of property, plant and equipment (see Note (19)) and intangible assets (see Note (18)) were
measured at fair value. For this valuation an external expert was engaged. Management determined
the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement used by the
expert.

The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at
the end of each reporting period. These assets are tested once a year for indications of impairments. If
there are any such indications, estimates of the expected future cash flows from the utilisation and
potential disposal of these assets are made for assessing the impairment. The actual cash flows may
differ appreciably from the discounted future cash flows which are based on these estimates. Factors
such as a change in the planned utilisation of buildings, machinery and equipment, technical aging or
utilisation levels of installations which are lower than original forecasts may reduce the useful service
life or may result in an impairment.

**_Pension provisions_**

The valuation of provisions for pensions and similar obligations is influenced by assumptions regarding
the future development of wages and salaries or pensions as well as discount rates.


-----

In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst
Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension fund (Pensionskasse –
PK) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed
via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company, Ilmarinen, Finland.
The calculations of the liabilities recognised with regard to these facilities are based on statistical and
actuarial calculations of the actuaries. In particular, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation
depends on assumptions such as the discount rate and the pension growth rate used for calculating
the present value of the future pension obligations. Future salary increases and increases in the other
benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of the future pension
obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by the Group also use statistical data such
as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions. The discount
rate for the actuarial calcuations of the German and Finnish defined-benefit obligations was determined
by applying the Mercer Pension Yield Curve Approach (MYC). The data and methodology used to
create the MYC is reviewed periodically by Mercer to ensure consistency and improved estimates.

**_Environmental provisions_**

The provision recognised for environmental protection measures (see Note (27)) represents the best
estimate of the expected outflow of funds. The provision relates to expected costs of rehabilitating toxic
waste sites in Switzerland as well as waste disposal at the production location in Kokkola. The future
development of environmental costs depends on many factors including the rehabilitation method to be
used, the extent of the rehabilitation measures as well as the shares attributable to the Group and to
external parties.

Due to uncertainties related to the prediction of environmental rehabilitation costs, it is possible that
additional costs may occur which exceed the recognised provision. Based on the latest available
information, management considers that the provision as of December 31, 2020 and December 31,
2021 are adequate.

**(4)** **Scope of Consolidation**

The scope of consolidation comprises Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., with registered office in Luxembourg,
as well as all domestic and international subsidiaries. Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. directly or indirectly
owns a majority of voting rights in these companies. There are no joint ventures or associated
companies.

In addition to Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. as the parent company, the consolidated financial statements
as of December 31, 2021 include three Luxembourg and fourteen non-Luxembourg companies in which
Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. exercises control and is therefore exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns
from its involvement with the entities and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over
the aforementioned entities.

The following table shows the share of capital held by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. as of December 31,
2021 and December 31, 2020:

**(5)** **Segment information**

On November 17, 2021, the Group announced a reorganisation of its group structure to become a fully
integrated contract development and manufacturing company under a centralised “One CABB”
organisation managing sales, procurement, production and administration. As part of the change, the
former business units Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls were combined into one and the internal
management reporting to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) was aligned accordingly in the
fourth quarter of the financial year 2021.

Prior to the reorganisation, the format for reporting the activities of the CABB Group by operating
segment to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) was structured by the business unit Custom
Manufacturing and Acetyls. This classification corresponded to the way in which the information was
reviewed by CABB Group’s management for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing
performance.

The business activities of the CABB Group were organised in the following reported operating
segments:

- The business unit Custom Manufacturing focused on the production of exclusives, which are active
ingredients and advanced intermediates customised for individual customers operating in the
agrochemcial, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries.

- The business unit Acetyls focused on the production of monochloroacetic acid, or MCA, acetyl
derivatives and co-products, which are used in a variety of applications in the agrochemical, food,
pharmaceutical and personal care industries.

No operating segments have been aggregated in arriving at the reportable segments of the Group.

**a) Segment revenue**

The revenue from external parties reported to the chief operating decision maker is measured
consistent to the manner applied in the Consolidated statement of profit and loss and other
comprehensive income.


-----

**b) Segment EBITDA**

In determining the segment result, CABB Group applies the same principles of recognition and
measurement as in the consolidated financial statements. The Group measures the performance of its
segment on the basis of a segment income variable referred to by Internal Control and Reportings as
“Adjusted EBITDA”. This measurement basis excludes the effects of adjustments from the operating
segment result. Adjustments are defined as expenses and income not related to the operational
performance of the business activities such as restructuring costs, strategic development initiatives,
financial impacts of natural disasters (including fire, storm and related events), property damage
insurance compensations, as well as valuation impacts resulting from purchase price allocations. In the
first half of the financial year 2021, CABB Group’s performance was negatively affected by extreme
winter weather conditions in the Gulf coast area in the US, impacting the business operatings of raw
material suppliers of CABB Group. These suppliers were forced to declare the occurrence of a force
majeure event for various products such as, inter alia, Acetic Acid. This resulted in a loss of already
contracted business (purchase orders), which was not compensated by the insurance and was
normalised as part of the adjustments. Interest income and expenses are not allocated to the segments
as these are managed by the central treasury function.

**c) Segment Net Working Capital**

The amounts reported to CABB Group’s management with respect to Operating Net Working Capital
are measured in the same way as in the financial statements.


-----

**d) Segment additions to non-current assets**

Amounts provided to the management of the CABB Group for additions to non-current assets are
reported consistently with the consolidated statement of changes in non-current assets, except for
additions to non-current assets recognised in connection with IFRS 16 "Leases", which are therefore
not included in the following table:

**(6)** **Revenue from contracts with customers**

The Group generates revenues primarily from the sale of customised active ingredients, advanced
intermediates, diversified specialty chemicals with a strong focus on the agrochemicals industry.

**a) Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers**

In the following table, revenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by location of the
customer and timing of revenue recognition. The table also provides a reconciliation of the
disaggregated revenue with the Group’s reportable segments (see Note 5).

Over time 240,809 214,934
**Total revenue from external Customers** **588,988** **492,287**

Revenues within Europe mainly refer to Switzerland and Germany.

The Group derives revenues from three customers, which each account for more than 10 percent of
total Group Sales.

**b) Assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers**

The group has recognised the following assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers:

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

Contract assets relating to the Exclusives business 13,646 7,646
Loss allowance -1 -1
**Total contract assets** **13,645** **7,645**

Contract liabilities relating to the Exclusives 11,704 10,454
Contract liabilities relating to advances received 0 0
**Total contract liabilities** **11,704** **10,454**

Within the product group ‘Exclusives and Specialties’, revenue from specific customer contracts is
recognised over time. In these cases CABB’s performance obligation consists in the creation of an
asset without an alternative use to CABB and CABB has an enforceable right to payment for the
performance obligation completed to date. These contractually enforcable rights are recognised within
the line ‘Contract assets’.

Certain customer contracts within the product group ‘Exclusives and Specialties’ provide for nonrefundable capital expenditure fees, paid by the customer at the beginning or during the project. These
advance payments are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in proportion to the
performance used by the customer during the contract period. The outstanding performance obligation
is disclosed in the balance sheet item ‘Contract liabilities’ at each reporting date. It is possible that the
performance obligation at a given point in time is in a contract asset or a contract liability position.


-----

The weighted-average expected remaining term of the contract liabilities as of December 31, 2021 is
2.0 years (2020: 3.4 years).

If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a
specific point in time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognised at a specific point in
time, generally upon delivery.

In the financial year 2021, the Group recognised revenues in an amount of kEUR 4,483 (2020:
kEUR 6,012), which are relating to contract liabilities recognised as of the respective reporting date of
the previous financial year.

expense of the Group (see Note (28)).

Other interest expenses increased by kEUR 982 to kEUR 6,059 (2020: kEUR 5,077), driven by
transaction costs, which are amortised over the term of the Notes (see Note (28)) (2021: kEUR 4,500;
2020: kEUR 4,213) and higher interest expenses incurred in conjunction with the factoring programmes.

Other financial expenses amounted to kEUR 1,225 (2020: kEUR 1,239) and mainly comprise
commitment fees for the revolving credit facility kEUR 896 (2020: kEUR 937) and the securitisation
programme.

Changes in the fair value of the financial instruments embedded in the Notes led to other financial
expenses in an amount of kEUR 14,352, whereas in the financial year 2020, other financial income in
an amount of kEUR 7,963 was recognised.

The net foreign currency result of kEUR +8,731 (2020: kEUR -4,489) mainly comprises valuation effects
from the foreign currency translation of group-internal transactions (predominately financing activities)
in an amount of kEUR +9,261 (2020: kEUR -2,899)

**(16) Taxes on income**

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. and CABB Nordic Holding S.à r.l. are subject to
Luxembourg corporate income tax rate of 17.0% (2020: 17.0%), leading to a combined overall tax rate
of 24.94% (2020: 24.94%), which is taking into account a 7.0% (2020: 7.0%) employment fund
contribution/solidarity surtax on the corporate income tax rate, plus a municipal business tax on profits
of 6.75% (2020: 6.75%). Since the Group operates across the world, it is subject to income taxes in
several different tax jurisdictions with income tax rates in the range from 18.0% to 29.71% (2020: 18.0%
to 29.59%).

Taxes on income for the financial year 2021 are broken down as follows:

Non-deductible interest expenses predominately incur within the German and Finnish tax jurisdiction,
which limits the deductibility of interest expenses to 30.0% or 25.0% of the EBITDA defined for the
purpose of the interest rate cap regulation. The non-deductible portion of net interest expenses
amounted to kEUR 15,633 in the financial year 2021 (2020: kEUR 18,246). Although these amounts
may in principle be carried forward indefinitely and offset against future interest income, no deferred tax
assets in respect to interest tax loss carry-forwards in the amount of kEUR 125,737 (December 31,
2020: kEUR 110,104) were recognised, as the prerequisites for their usability will not be fullfilled within
the foreseeable future. Furthermore, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax
loss carry-forwards amounting to kEUR 11,691 (2020: kEUR 15,481), as it is not probable that sufficient
taxable profit will be available against which they may be utilised. Of these tax losses carried forward,
kEUR 4,112 (2020: kEUR 5,154) will expire within two years, kEUR 199 will expire in three years
(2020: kEUR 4,469), kEUR 0 in four years (2020: kEUR 2,429), kEUR 0 in five years (2020: kEUR 27)
and kEUR 7,380 thereafter (2020: kEUR 3,401).

In conjunction with actuarial gains/ losses of defined-benefit plans, deferred income taxes amounting
to kEUR -4,562 (2020: kEUR -286) are included within other comprehensive income (OCI).

from the appreciation of the Swiss Francs and the US Dollar against the Euro.

There are no material contractual obligations for acquiring intangible assets.

**Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test and is also reviewed if there is any indication of an**
impairment. The goodwill impairment test is performed on the basis of cash-generating units (CGUs)
by comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying amount.

The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is calculated based on the fair value less costs to
sell approach. The underlying cash flow projections are based on past experiences, current results and
on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. Market assumptions, such as the
development of the overall economy and the market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific information sources. The required discounting of cash flows for
impairment testing is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital rate after tax, which is
determined using the capital asset pricing model. It comprises a risk-free interest rate, a makret risk
premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective industry-specific peer group. The fair
value measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair value.

On November 17, 2021, the Group announced a reorganisation of its group structure to become a fully
integrated contract development and manufacturing company under a centralised “One CABB”
organisation managing sales, procurement, production and administration. As part of the change, the
former business units Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls were combined into one and the internal
management reporting to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) was aligned accordingly in the
fourth quarter of the financial year 2021. Consistent with the new internal management and reporting
structure, the following three cash generating units have been identified: (i) CDMO – Europe, (ii) CDMO
– North America, (iii) Non - CDMO. The CGUs reflect the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill
is monitored for internal management purposes. The existing goodwill was allocated to the new CGUs
in accordance with the purchase price allocation in 2014 for the CGU CDMO – Europe and the CGU
Non – CDMO resp. 2019 for the CGU CDMO – North America..

The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2021. Due to the changed segment
reporting and the consecutive changes of the CGUs two sets of impairment tests were performed: one
for the former CGU structure (Acetyls and Custom Manufacturing) and one for the new CGU structure
(CDMO – Europe, CDMO – North America and Non – CDMO). The financial projections were approved
by management and consist of a detailed planning period of five years.

The following table provides an overview of the goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and of the
calculation parameters used for the new CGU structure:


-----

As of December 31, 2021, the recoverable amount of all cash-generating units exceed their carrying
amounts, so that no goodwill impairment is indicated.

Until the third quarter of the financial year 2021, the group’s internal management reporting to the chief
operating decision maker (CODM) was organised by business units (BU’s): (i) BU Custom
Manufacturing, comprising CABB AG, Pratteln (Switzerland); CABB Oy, Kokkola (Finland) and Jayhawk
Fine Chemicals Corporation, Galena, Kansas (USA). (ii) BU Acetyls, comprising CABB GmbH,
Gersthofen (Germany) and CABB Jinwei Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co. Ltd. (PRC). The Acetyls and
Custom Manufacturing units were identified as cash-generating units constituting the lowest level within
the entity at which the goodwill was monitored for internal management purposes.

Under the former management and reporting structure, Goodwill was allocated to the cash-generating
units as follows:

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2020** **Dec. 31, 2019**

Business units:

Custom Manufacturing 131,267 131,352
Acetyls 59,488 59,488
**Goodwill** **190,755** **190,840**

Due to the change in the management reporting structure, the annual impairment tests were performed
as of October 31, 2021, also in line with the former reporting structure by business unit. A perpetual
growth rate of 1.3% (2020: 1.3%) for the Custom Manufacturing unit and 1.0% (2020: 1.0%) for the
business unit Acetyls were applied for the period beyond the five-year period and does not exceed the
long-term average growth rate for both businesses.

For the business unit Custom Manufacturing, an average revenue growth of 4.7% (2020: 4.1%) and an
average EBITDA-margin of 25.0% (2020: 25.6%) are assumed. The future cash flows generated by the
former business unit Custom Manufacturing are discounted at a post-tax rate of 6.8% (2020: 6.1%).
The cashflow projection is influenced by the growth of the agrochemical market. For the business unit
Acetyls, an average revenue growth of 2.7% (2020: 4.1%) and an average EBITDA-margin of 20.4%
(2020: 22.0%) are assumed. The future cash flows generated by the former business unit Acetyls are
discounted at a post-tax rate of 7.0% (2020:6.5%).

The recoverable amount of both business units exceed their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2021
and as of December 31, 2020. No goodwill impairment was indicated.

Customer relations and technologies were recognised in conjunction with the acquistion of CABB Group
in the financial year 2014 and upon acquistion of Jayhawk’s business on November 1, 2018. They are
amortised over their expected useful life (between 7.9 and 20 years). Amortisation of intangible assets
is included in Cost of sales as well as in Distribution and logistics expenses.

Accounts receivable, trade 70,851 44,906

**Total accounts receivable, trade** **70,545** **44,633**

Trade receivables increased by kEUR 25,912 to kEUR 70,545 as of December 31, 2021, driven by a
strong business development and influenced by positive pricing effects resulting from the pass-through
of increasing raw material prices and freight and energy costs. Trade receivables sold under a
customer’s factoring programme amounted to kEUR 11,401 as of December 31, 2021 (December 31,
2020: kEUR 9,885).

As of December 31, 2020, trade receivables decreased by kEUR 25,954 to kEUR 44,633, thereof by
kEUR 23,285 as a result of the implementation of a securitisation programm in June 2020 and by
kEUR 7,039 due to a higher volume of trade receivables sold under a customer’s factoring programme.

Since June 2020, the Group sells without recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured
entity under an asset-backed securitisation programme. The financing volume is committed to a
maximum amount of kEUR 30,000. The structured entity is not controlled by CABB and therefore not
consolidated by the Group. The special purpose entity obtains its funding primarily from capital markets
through the issuance of commercial papers and has mandated the Group to service the receivables in
return for an at arm’s-length fee. The structured entity has the contractual right to terminate this service
agreement and may appoint as substitute servicer any other person. The Group transfers the
contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a revolving basis at their nominal
value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is presented as part of other
financial receivables and represents the Group’s right to receive this amount once the trade receivables
sold have been settled by the customers. To the extend to which the credit risk is retained by the Group
(continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and corresponding other financial liabilities are
recognised. The carrying amount of trade receivables transferred under the securitisation programme
amounted to kEUR 24,288 as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 23,844), of which
kEUR 23,662 have been derecognised (December 31, 2020: kEUR 23,285); and kEUR 3,325
(December 31, 2020: kEUR 3,036), representing the retained reserve, is presented as part of other
current financial receivables. The carrying amount of trade receivables (classified as trade receivables)
and the other financial liability resulting from the continuing involvement amounted to kEUR 626 as of
December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 559). See Note (34) and Note (35).

**(22) Other financial assets**

Other financial assets as of December 31, 2021 amount to kEUR 3,325 (December 31, 2020:
kEUR 3,036) and relate to a securitisation programme in the course of which the Group sells without
recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured entity.

The Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a
revolving basis at their nominal value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is
disclosed within other financial assets and represents the Group’s right to receive this amount in cash
once the trade receivables sold have been settled by the customers. The carrying amount of trade
receivables transferred under the securitisation programme amounted to kEUR 24,288 as of December
31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 23,844), of which kEUR 23,662 have been derecognised
(December 31, 2020: kEUR 23,285).

**(25) Equity**

The aim of capital management is to ensure financial flexibility for the long-term maintenance of
business operations and the exercise of strategic options. Securing liquidity and limiting financial risks
are objectives of financial policy and set important parameters for capital management. The responsible
corporate bodies decide on the target capital structure of the balance sheet, the appropriation of net
income and the amount of the dividend. Net financial debt is one of the most important indicators for
capital management

**Share capital and share premium**

_Share capital_

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. was established on May 9, 2014, with a subscribed capital of EUR 1,000 with
a nominal value of EUR 1 and 1,000 fully paid in shares.

All ordinary shares rank equally with regards to the Company’s residual assets. Holders of these shares
are entitled to dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at general
meetings of the Company

_Share premium_

The share premium results from a contribution in cash of kEUR 220,634 and contributions in kind of
kEUR 71,170.

**Other Reserves**

_Contribution Reserve_

The contribution Reserve amounts to kEUR 11,376 and represents the difference between the
contribution amount of the equity investment in Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) as of October
7, 2019 (contribution date), and the nominal value of the Subscribed capital plus the Share premium of
Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg).

**Equity attributable to non-controlling interests**

Non-controlling interests reflect the 32.4% share in CABB - Jinwei Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co.
Ltd., Zhanghuang Town (PRC), that is held by shareholders other than CABB.

On December 17, 2019, the shareholders of the Sino-foreign joint venture limited company decided the
conversion of certain portions of the shareholder loans into equity, as a consequence of which the equity
attributable to non-controlling interests increased by kEUR 8,172.

**(26) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

CABB Group provides its employees post-employment defined benefit plans. In Germany, retirement
benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss
employees of the Group are insured with the pension plan (Pensionskasse der CABB AG) of CABB
AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the
pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd., Ilmarinen (Finland).

The pension fund of CABB AG is organised as an independent registered trust (registrierte Stiftung)
and maintains a shift insurance plan and a regular pension plan. According to the deed of foundation,
the trust has the purpose to provide benefits to retired employees of CABB AG in the form of pension
payments for life and in case of disability or death within the framework of the Occupational Pension
Act (Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge BVG).
Alternatively, the employee can request a lump-sum payment of his accrued capital. The level of
benefits provided depends in general on employees’ length of service and their salary for respective
service years.

According to the pension plan rules, the pension benefits are financed by contributions of the
employees, the employer and the fund. Art. 32 of the pension plan determines that in case the means
of the fund are insufficient to meet the defined contributions by the fund, those contributions have to be
made by the employer. Contributions to the Swiss pension fund are expected to remain stable in the
short to medium term as payments are based on fixed percentages of pensionable benefits. If there is
a funding shortfall, the Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) can implement measures including: changing
benefits, lowering the returns credited to employees and changing the conversion rate. If the measures
are not sufficient to improve the funding level, and as a last resort, the fund can ask the employer and
employees to make additional contributions to close the gap.

CABB AG would then have to bear at least half of any extra payments. Swiss pension plans are
treated as defined benefit plans under IAS 19, as although contribution levels are in fact “fixed”, there
is a potential risk of extra payments in future.

Basis for the investment of plan assets is the investment regulation of the foundation dated
December 10, 2013. This regulation ensures the compliance with Occupational Pensions Act (BVG)
and best possible return within acceptable risk profile. Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) and Investment
Commission (Anlagekommission) define the long term investment structure as well as objectives and
benchmarks for the investments. Only bonds with solid credit risk rating (at least "BBB-") are selected
for investments. At least 50% of all bond investments are made in bonds with rating of "AA-" and higher.
Investment guidance is reviewed on an annual basis. All persons involved in investment decisions for
plan assets or otherwise employed by the pension fund are subject to confidentiality obligations and
have to follow the ASIP (Swiss pension fund association) Charter.

The defined benefit plans in Finland, Germany and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to actuarial
risks such as:

- **Interest risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount**
rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in the bond interest
rate will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition the decrease in interest rate will


-----

decrease interest expense; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the
plan assets.

- **Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to**
the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An
increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation.

- **Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the**
future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will
increase the defined benefit obligation.

In addition, defined benefit plans in Finland and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to the
investment risk: Decrease in the fair value of plan assets can create a plan deficit.

In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is calculated using the
actuarial valuation method for current one-off premiums or in accordance with the projected unit credit
method on the basis of specific parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the
present value of the pension obligation to show the funded statuts of the obligation. The extent of the
obligation as well as the plan assets are determined at regular intervals of not more than twelve months;
in the case of all defined-benefit plans, they are calculated every year as of December 31.

Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling
are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation
are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits.

The following parameters have been used as the basis for determining the present value of the benefit
obligations as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 for the domestic and international
companies:

Age- and gender-related fluctuation probabilities have been used.

The average duration of the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 is 13.6 years (December
31, 2020: 14.5 years).

The actuarial assumptions may differ from the actual results due to the change in market conditions
and economic climate, higher or lower retirement rates, longer or shorter lives of insured parties and
also other estimated factors. These differences can have an impact on the pension obligations
recognised in future reporting periods.

In the financial year 2021, the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability of the Swiss pension
plan resulted in a significant decrease in an amount of kEUR 39,084. This gain, which is included within
other comprehensive income, comprises the following components: (i) return on plan assets increased,
mainly driven by a higher market value of equity instruments, by kEUR 17,129. (ii) due to the mandatory
transition to new technical biometric principles, applied to calculate the pension funds' obligations (BVG
2020 GT; 2020: BGF 2015 GT), actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions were
recognised in an amount of kEUR 9,071. This was mainly driven by changes in the following biometric
parameters: increased churn rate of plan participants, a lower disability probability, a lower-thanexpected increase in the life expectancy and a decreased probability of leaving behind an eligible
partner upon the occurrence of the insured event. (iii) the discount rate increased from 0.15% p.a. in
the prior year to 0.3% p.a. in 2021, which resulted in an actuarial gain amounting to KEUR 3,724. (iv)
due to changes in the population of retirees and active employees, actuarial gains from experience
adjustments were recognised in an amount of kEUR 9,160.

The fair value of the plan assets developed as follows in the reporting period:


-----

The plan assets are broken down per investment category as follows:

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

Equity instruments 87,084 75,258
Debt instruments 76,533 83,093
Properties 37,678 26,399
Miscellaneous 10,976 7,475
**Fair Value of plan assets** **212,271** **192,225**

The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are mainly determined based on quoted market
prices in active markets whereas the fair values of properties are not based on quoted market prices in
active markets.

In the financial year 2021, the total actual income from plan assets amounted to kEUR 16,968 (2020:
kEUR 8,824), thereof in Switzerland kEUR 17,374 (2020: kEUR 6,953) and in Finland kEUR -406
(2020: kEUR 1,871).

In 2021, additional employer contributions of kEUR 5,230 (2020: kEUR 4,702) were made into statutory
pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans).

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount
rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based
on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting
period, while holding all other assumptions constant:

- If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligaton would decrease
by kEUR 14,341 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 17,113) (increase by kEUR 15,955; December 31,
2020: kEUR 19,071).

- If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation
would increase by kEUR 13,080 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 14,829) (decrease by kEUR 12,194;
December 31, 2020: kEUR 13,707).

- If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would
increase by kEUR 980 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 1,128) (decrease by kEUR 955, December 31,
2020: kEUR 1,093).

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another
as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit
obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period,
which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the
statement of financial position.

The Group expects to make a contribution of kEUR 3,924 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 3,538) to the
defined benefit plans during the next financial year.

Provisions for environment and rehabilitation relate to the responsibility of the Group in relation to the
cost of asbestos remediation and the rehabilitating of legacy issues of three landfill sites in Switzerland
as well as waste disposal obligations in Finland. The rehabilitation costs are borne by the major waste
contributors of the past, whereby the share of CABB AG is defined in accordance with a fixed distribution
key. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of management for the future outflow of funds in
connection with the rehabilitation obligations. Although the estimations and assumptions are regularly
reviewed and updated, the actual outcome can significantly differ from the current best estimate. The
rehabilitation of the largest landfill site is completed, which leads to the next phase of renaturation of
the site.

Personnel obligations include short term employee benefits for holiday allowances and overtime
kEUR 3,671 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 3,523), premiums and bonus payments of kEUR 6,022
(December 31, 2020: kEUR 4,144), and service anniversary payments of kEUR 1,802 (December 31,
2020: kEUR 1,723) as well as post-employment benefits of kEUR 577 (December 31, 2020:
kEUR 656). Other provisions mainly comprise provisions for other uncertain liabilities.

**(28) Notes**

The acquisition of the CABB Group was mainly financed by way of public Euro bonds which were issued
by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. in June 2014. On October 7, 2019, the
Group redeemed the existing indentures and issued the financial instruments described in the following.

The following table shows the nominal and effective interest rate as well as the book and market value
of the Notes as of December 31, 2021 by class:


-----

The Senior Notes were issued by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., whereas the Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes were issued by Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. On the Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes, the interest is payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15
and December 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2021. On the Fixed Rate Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Notes, interest is payable semianually in arrears on March 15 and September 15
in each year, commencing on March 15, 2021.

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes are guaranteed on a general
senior secured basis by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., CABB Group GmbH, CABB Holding GmbH, CABB
GmbH, CABB Europe GmbH, CABB AG, CABB Nordic Holding S.à. r.l., CABB Finland Oy, CABB Oy,
Kansas HoldCo 1, Inc. and Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation. They are secured by first-ranking
security interests in the share capital of each of the guaranteeing CABB entities; certain material bank
accounts, intra-group loan receivables, certain material real estate owned by CABB AG and CABB Oy
and certain other assets of CABB Finland Oy, CABB Oy and Jayhawk.

The Senior Notes are guaranteed by the above mentioned CABB entities on a senior subordinated
basis. They are primarily secured by second-ranking security interests in the share capital of Monitchem
Holdco 3 S.A..

The Group may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due
2025 at any time after September 15, 2020; the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2025 on or after
September 15, 2021 and the Senior Notes due 2026 on or after September 14, 2022.

Such early redemption options are reported as embedded derivatives. Upon certain events defined as
constituting a change of control the bond issuers are required to make an offer to purchase the
outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest.

The notes agreement defines certain covenants which, among other things, restrict the ability of the
bond issuers and their subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends,
redeem capital stock or make certain investments, transfer or sell certain assets, merge or consolidate
with other entities or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Certain covenants will be suspended
if the relevant notes obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating.

The notes are recognised at their aggregate principal amounts plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Transaction costs, which are amortised over the term of the notes, are deducted in an amount of
kEUR 18,147 as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 22,456).

The market value of the Notes and the market value of embedded derivatives in the indenture are
categorised as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

The remaining 13.68% of the ordinary shares are held by CABB Co-Investment 1 GmbH & Co. KG and
CABB Co-Investment 2 GmbH & Co. KG, both Sulzbach (Taunus), Germany. These companies were
established in the course of the acquisition of the CABB Group in order to provide the management
team, the members of the advisory board as well as additional senior executives of the Group with the
opportunity of investing indirectly in this acquisition.

Monitchem MidCo S.à r.l., Luxembourg, is 91.74% (based on the ordinary shares quota) owned by
Monitchem S.à r.l., Luxembourg, the ultimate parent company that is beneficially owned by funds
advised by Permira Funds. The remaining 8.26% of the ordinary shares are held by CABB CoInvestment 3 GmbH & Co. KG, and CABB Co-Investment 4 GmbH & Co. KG, both Sulzbach (Taunus),
Germany. These companies were established in order to provide members of the management team,
the members of the advisory board as well as additional senior executives of the Group with the
opportunity of investing indirectly in the future development of the Group. In the event of the sale of
Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. or other Group companies, the shareholders and managing directors as well
as some employees and the members of the advisory board of the CABB Group are therefore entitled
to participate in the disposal proceeds. However, this will not result in any financial charges for
Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. or another Group company.

The ultimate controlling party of the Group is Permira V Fund.

Based on domiciliation agreements Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. were

**(34) Financial instruments**

The following table shows the carrying amounts and market values of financial assets and liabilities by
category of financial instrument under IFRS 9 and a reconciliation to the corresponding line items in the
consolidated statement of financial position:


-----

(1) AC : at amortised cost
FVTPL : at fair value through profit or loss
(2) FVOCI : at fair value through other comprehensive income

No changes of fair value hierarchy took place in the shown financial years.

The following valuation techniques have been used for determining the fair values of financial assets
and financial liabilities:

- **Market comparison technique (i.e. Notes): financial instruments with standard terms and**
conditions which are traded on active markets are valuated based on broker quotes. Similar
contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transations in similar
instruments.

- **Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives): financial instruments that are not traded in an active**
market (for example: derivatives) are valuated considering the present value of expected future
cash flows based on observable yield curves.

- **Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of embedded**
derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte Carlo simulation.
For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is calibrated such that
the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (Bourse
de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing model also considers the riskfree interest rate as another paramater.

These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely
as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair
value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. There are no
financial instruments, which require a determination of fair values based on unobservable inputs
(level 3).

Derivative financial instruments (embedded derivatives in the indenture and interest rate swaps not
included in a designated hedging relationship) are categorised as “at fair value through profit or loss” in
accordance with IFRS 9. They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their
maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive
fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). The value of the embedded derivatives is
affected by the interest of the comparable market instrument on each potential exercise date and will
rise if the relevant interest rate declines and vice versa.

Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “at
amortised cost” under IFRS 9 as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly
have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference
date are approximately equivalent to the fair value.


-----

Trade accounts receivable and other financial liabilities of the category “at fair value through other
comprehensive income” under IFRS 9 represent the credit risk retained by the Group with regards to
trade accounts receivable, which are sold under the securitisation programme (continuing involvement).

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the interest income and expense, the
amortisation of arrangement fees, bank fees and other fees, the result from the translation of foreign
currencies and other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line financial
instruments at fair value through profit and loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments
measured at fair value through profit or loss which are not designated as hedging instruments in
accordance with IFRS 9. No hedge accounting is applied.

Net gains and losses from financial instruments by valuation categories are as follows:

**kEUR** **2021** **2020**

**Financial assets at amortised cost**

interest result 6 17
currency translation -781 -1,588

**Total** **-53,751** **-43,863**

**(35) Financial risk management**

The operations of the Group are exposed to liquidity, credit, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The
Group’s overall risk management seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial
performance. In November 2019, the Group joined a factoring contract of one of its customers, in the
course of which trade receivables due from a major customer are settled through a bank.

Since June 2020, the Group sells without recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured
entity under an asset-backed securitisation programme. The financing volume is committed to a
maximum amount of kEUR 30,000. The structured entity is not controlled by CABB and therefore not
consolidated by the Group. The special purpose entity obtains its funding primarily from capital markets
through the issuance of commercial papers and has mandated the Group to service the receivables in
return for an at arm’s-length fee. The structured entity has the contractual right to terminate this service
agreement and may appoint as substitute servicer any other person. The Group transfers the
contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a revolving basis at their nominal
value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is presented as part of other
financial receivables and represents the Group’s right to receive this amount once the trade receivables
sold have been settled by the customers. To the extend to which the credit risk is retained by the Group
(continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and corresponding other financial liabilities are
recognised. The carrying amount of trade receivables transferred under the securitisation programme
amounted to kEUR 24,288 as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 23,844), of which
kEUR 23,662 have been derecognised (December 31, 2020: kEUR 23,285); and kEUR 3,325
(December 31, 2020: kEUR 3,036), representing the retained reserve, is presented as part of other
current financial receivables. The carrying amount of trade receivables (classified as trade receivables)


-----

and the other financial liability resulting from the continuing involvement amounted to kEUR 626 as of
December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 559).

**Foreign currency risks**

The Group is exposed to changes in exchange rates leading to losses in the value of financial
instruments. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing
rate of financial receivables, cash and financial liabilities including intercompany loans into the functional
currency of the respective consolidated entity. The foreign currency exposure corresponds to the net
amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments that are exposed
to currency risks.

The Group has the objective to keep the risks from foreign currency at an acceptable level. It only
accepts the risks to the extent necessary to finance the foreign subsidiaries and to support the business
operations.

The following table shows the foreign currency exposure from financial instruments broken down by the
individual major currencies as of December 31, 2021. A reasonably possible 10% strengthening
(weakening) of the USD, CHF and RMB against all other currencies would have affected the
measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and affected equity and profit
or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest
rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases. As the derivatives
embedded in the Notes are denominated in EURO, no foreign currency exposure relating to the
functional currency of the Group exists.

**Total effect** **175,478** **-28,797** **146,681** **13,334**

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risks result from changes in prevailing market interest rates, which can cause a change in
the fair value of fixed-rate instruments, and changes in the interest payments of variable-rate
instruments. While these risks are relevant to the financing activities of the Group (long term notes),
they are not of significant importance for the Group’s operating activities.

Borrowings issued at variable interest rates exposes the Group cash flow interest rate risks. On October
7, 2019, the Group has refinanced the existing Floating Rate Notes by issuing Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes in an amount of kEUR 175,000. These notes bear a nominal interest rate equal to the 3
month EURIBOR plus 5.250%, whereby if the 3m EURIBOR is less than zero, such rate is deemed to
be zero. Given the currrent and prospective short term interest rate environment, the Group did not


-----

enter into new interest rate swaps during the reporting period. The existing floating-to-fixed interest rate
swap, which mitigated to a large extent the cash flow interest rate risks under the former variable interest
rate financing agreements matured on June 15, 2019.

The following table shows the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments
and the exposure to the interest rate risk:

**Nominal amount**

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

**Fixed-rate instruments**
Financial liabilities -488,592 -485,981
**-488,592** **-485,981**

**Variable-rate instruments**
Financial liabilties -190,000 -185,000
Effect of interest rate swaps 0 0
**-190,000** **-185,000**

The following sensitivity analysis shows the reasonably possible effects of a 1% increase or decline in
interest rates on the consolidated result after tax for the financial year 2021, while holding all other
variables (in particular foreign currency exchange rates) constant:

**kEUR** **31.12.2021** **31.12.2020**

1% increase in interest rates -1,970 -6,675
1% decrease in interest rates 3,113 4,287

**Credit risk**

A default risk of financial instruments arises if counterparties are not able to meet their payment
obligations, or are not able to meet these obligations in full. Cash and cash equivalents are only held
with selected banks and thus with contract partners which is rated at least BBB by S&P or Fitch or at
least Baa2 by Moody’s in order to limit this risk.

The risk attributable to trade accounts receivable or financial receivables is defined as the risk that
outstanding receivables are not settled on time or that they are not settled at all. A credit risk
management system operating on the basis of a globally applied credit policy ensures that credit risks
are constantly monitored and bad debts minimised. This policy, which applies to both new and existing
customers, governs the allocation of credit limits and compliance with those limits, individual analyses
of customers’ creditworthiness based on both internal and external financial and macro-economic
information, risk classification, and continuous monitoring of the risk of bad debts at the local level.
Collateral received (e.g. documentary letters of credit) and other safeguards include country-specific
and customer-specific protection afforded by credit insurance, confirmed and unconfirmed letters of
credit in export business, as well as warranties and guarantees. Furthermore, in certain cases downpayments and advance payments are agreed. As soon as receivables have reached the second
dunning level, the sales department is required to make clear payment agreements with the customer.
A dunning run is carried out every week. If a receivable reaches the third dunning level, further deliveries
are suspended until payment is actually received. We also monitor our key customer relationships at
the regional and global level. In case a contract partner becomes defaulted, all financial asset with this
counterparty are impaired.

The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that CABB Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated
with its financial liabilities. The Group’s approach to manage liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible,


-----

that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due. The Group monitors and
reports cash flow on a monthly basis.

Current financial liabilities are backed by cash and cash equivalents kEUR 40,521; (December 31,
2020: kEUR 52,132), by unutilised revolving credit facilities of kEUR 59,500 (December 31, 2020: kEUR
64,500) and a guarantee line of kEUR 5,500 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 5,500).

###### REPORT OF THE RÉVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGRÉÉ

 Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

 Opinion

 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 

 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2020, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

 Basis for Opinion

 We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the “Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs are further described in the « Responsibilities of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

 Other information

 The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” thereon.


-----

###### Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

 In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

 Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements 

 The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

 In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

 Responsibilities of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements

 The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

 As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

##### — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial

###### statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

##### — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit

###### procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.


-----

##### — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

###### accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

##### — Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of

###### accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

##### — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial

###### statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

##### Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., Luxembourg
 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 2020

**(1)** **General**

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. with registered office at 488, route de Longwy in L-1940 Luxembourg
(hereafter “the Company”, “the CABB Group”) was established on May 9, 2014 as a public limited
liability company and was registered on May 22, 2014 in the commercial register of Luxembourg under
number B 187114. The Company’s sole shareholder is Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., Luxembourg, an
entity which is beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds.

On October 7, 2019, Monitchem S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) (the “Contributor”), a wholly owned subsidiay of
Permira Funds, and Monitchem Midco S.à r.l., the direct parent company of Monitchem Holdco 1
S.à r.l., entered into a contribution agreement, pursuant to which the Contributor transferred the entire
shares of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg), to Monitchem Midco S.à. r.l. (Luxembourg), which
in turn contributed such shares to the capital reserves of its indirect subsidiary Monitchem Holdco 2
S.A. (Luxembourg), through a contribution in kind without issue of shares. The shares were then
contributed down the chain of subsidiaries, such that Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) is
ultimately held by CABB Europe GmbH (Germany). As this transaction involved only entities, which are
ultimately controlled by Permira funds, the Group decided to account for this transaction by applying
the predecessor value method through a retrospective restatement of comparative financial information,
as if the transaction had occurred in the financial year 2018.

CABB is one of the leading European producers of customised active ingredients, advanced
intermediates and diversified specialty chemicals with a focus on the agrochemical industry. Our
business operations are organized in two business units, the Custom Manufacturing business unit and
the Acetyls business unit.

The Custom Manufacturing business unit focuses on the production of exclusives and intermediates.
Exclusives are active ingredients and advanced intermediates customised for individual customers
operating in the agrochemicals, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries. Our exclusives are
primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides in the agrochemicals industry and range from
pilot scale to large-volume commercial operations. Our intermediates are products manufactured for
multiple customers and include acid chlorides, chemical building blocks and various base chemicals.
They are to a large extent used in agrochemical applications but also in other diverse end-uses, such
as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and dyestuffs for textile
application.

The Group is one of the leading custom manufacturing suppliers in the European agrochemicals market
by revenues, serving the major global agrochemicals companies and holds strategic supplier status
with the largest, European-based agrochemical companies for their agrochemicals business. Our
customised products are highly integrated in our key customers’ supply chains (often protected by solesupplier relationships for major products) and we are closely aligned in demand planning and supply
chain coordination. Our key agrochemicals customers are active in a structurally growing global market
driven by population growth, improving living standards and changing dietary trends especially in
emerging markets. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we operate complementary multipurpose production facilities in Pratteln (Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland) and Galena (USA).

The Acetyls business unit is focused on the production of monochloroacetic acid (MCA), acetyl
derivatives and co-products, which have a variety of applications in the agrochemicals, food,
pharmaceutical and personal care industries. Our key customers’ end-markets follow different demand
patterns and demonstrate different levels of cyclicality, leading to a diversified market exposure for


-----

CABB and as such demonstrated relative resilience versus economic downturns. We produce MCA in
different purity grades (ultra-pure, high pure, technical global and technical local) for different
applications and regional markets and in different trade forms (flakes, solution, molten and sodium
monochloroacetic acid) to enable longer distance transportation based on the customer’s preference
and location. We also offer our customers a range of derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid
and trichloroacetic acid, among others. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are
by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and are sold to customers or used captively in
subsequent processes and production steps. We are one of the principal suppliers of MCA to Western
Europe and the Americas. The Acetyls business unit operates three production facilities globally: two
in Germany and one in China through our cooperation with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd..

**(2)** **Principles of preparing the consolidated financial statements**

The consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. for the year ended December 31,
2020 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
endorsed by the European Union valid on the reference date and in accordance with the Luxembourg
legal and regulatory requirements. All IFRSs and pronouncements of the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) which are binding for the financial year 2020 have been
applied as endorsed by the European Union.

The consolidated financial statements of the CABB Group are drawn up in euros. Except where
otherwise indicated, amounts are stated in thousands of euros (kEUR) and rounded to the nearest
thousand. Adding individual figures may therefore not always result in the exact total given.

The consolidated financial statements were prepared and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors
on March 26, 2021.

**_New standards and interpretations adopted by the Group_**

With effect from January 1, 2020, we applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations
published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union.
The amendments had no material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations:

These amendments and clarifications did not have significant impacts on CABB Group’s consolidated
financial statements.

- Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards. (applicable for
reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020). The amendments update references to
and quotes from the Conceptual Framework. The revised Conceptual Framework issued on March
29, 2018 replaces the previous Conceptual Framework from 2010. The main changes primarily
relate to the definition, recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities, as well as the
differentiation between income and expense and other comprehensive income. (An endorsement
by the European Union was issued on November 29, 2019).

- Amendments to IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements_ and IAS 8 _Accounting Policies,_
_Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after_
January 1, 2020). The amendments provide a uniform and more precise definition of the materiality
of information provided in the financial statements, together with accompanying examples. In this
connection, the definitions in the Conceptual Framework, IAS 1, IAS 8 and the IFRS Practice
Statement 2 (Making Materiality Judgements) were harmonised. (An endorsement by the European
Union was issued on November 29, 2019).

- Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The IASB issued
amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 on September 26, 2019, completing Phase 1 of the
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform project. The amendments relate to existing uncertainties with
regards to the IBOR reform. According to original hedge accounting policies, pending adjustments
to benchmark interest rates would, in many cases, result in an end to hedging relationships. The


-----

amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 ensure the continuity of hedging relationships despite existing
uncertainties regarding interest rate benchmarks, for example by defining that the highly probable
requirement is always considered to be met. In connection with the amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS
39, disclosure requirements were added to IFRS 7. The amendments were endorsed by the
European Union on January 15, 2020.

- Amendment to IFRS 3 _Business Combinations._ The amendments issued on October 22, 2018
specify that a business is a set of activities and assets with at least one input and one substantive
process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Outputs are defined as
the provision of goods and services to customers. The existing reference to cost reduction as a
characteristic of business combinations was removed. In addition, the new provisions also contain
an optional concentration test designed to simplify identification of a business. The modified
definition was endorsed by the European Union on April 21, 2020.

- Amendment to IFRS 16 _Leases Relating to Coronavirus-related Rent Concessions._ On May 28,
2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16 aimed at simplifying lessees’ accounting of
concessions, such as deferments of rent payment or deductions in rent prices, which are granted
as a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic. If certain requirements are met, lessees may forego
the determination of whether a coronavirus-related rent concession presents a modification of the
lease agreement. These amendments were endorsed by the European Union on October 9, 2020.

The following IFRSs and their interpretations are not yet in force in 2020 but already endorsed by the
European Union. They were reviewed and are explained below, CABB currently assumes that they will
have no material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and does not plan to early adopt
these amendments.

- Amendments to IFRS 4 _Insurance Contracts – Extensions of Temporary Exemption from_
_Application of IFRS 9. The amendments to IFRS 4 issued on June 25, 2020 are aligned with the_
two-year postponement of the date on which IFRS 17 will come into force to reporting periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2023. They include an analogue extension of the temporary
exemption period for certain insurance companies from application of IFRS 9 – Financial
Instruments, requiring these insurance companies to apply IFRS 9 for the first time in fiscal years
beginning on or after, January 1, 2023. The amendments were endorsed by the European Union
on December 15, 2020 and are to be applied for the first time on or after January 1, 2021.

- Amendments to IFRS 9 _Financial Instruments,_ IAS 39 _Financial Instruments: Recognition and_
_Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and IFRS_
16 Leases – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2. The amendments from phase 2 of the
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, which were issued on August 27, 2020, are intended to simplify
accounting during the IBOR reform. They supplement the requirements from the first phase and
generally deal with the replacement from the first phase and generally deal with the replacement of
one benchmark interest rate with another. With respect to the presentation of financial instruments,
it was clarified that in the case of changes to contractual cash flows, the carrying amount of financial
instruments is not to be adjusted or derecognised. Under certain conditions, the effective interest
rate can be changed to reflect the change in the alternative interest rate benchmark. Similarly, with
respect to the accounting treatment of hedging transactions, under certain conditions, it is not
necessary to end a hedge accounting relationship designated for hedge accounting purposes due
to IFRS 16 and IFRS 4 as well as additional IFRS 7 disclosure requirements were adopted the
amendments were endorsed by the European Union on January 13, 2021 and will come into force
for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021.

The following IFRSs and interpretations were issued by the IASB, which are still subject to the
endorsement of the endorsement by the Europeand Union, their application is not not yet mandatory.
These amendments are unlikely to have a material impact on the reporting of CABB. CABB does not
plan on early adoption of these amendments.


-----

- Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities. The IASB
issued amendments to IAS 1 on January 23, 2020. The amendments pertain to a limited
modification of the relevant criteria used to classify liabilities as current or noncurrent. They specify
that the classification of liabilities as current depends on the company’s rights as of the balance
sheet date to postpone settlement of the liability by a minimum of 12 months after the end of the
reporting period. If such rights exist, the liability is classified as noncurrent. Otherwise, it is classified
as current. Classification is irrespective of management’s expectations and of possible events after
the balance sheet date. It also specifies that settlement of a liability is defined as the repayment of
liability using cash, other economic resources or a company’s own equity instruments. The IASB
issued a further amendment on July 15, 2020 whereby the date of initial application of the amendment on classification of liabilities will be postponed by one year to January 1, 2023 – subject to
endorsement by the European Union.

- Amendments to IFRS 3 _Business Combinations,_ IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37
_Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS_
2018 – 2020. These amendments were issued on May 14, 2020 and – subject to the endorsement
of the European Union – will come into force on January 1, 2022. The amendments to IFRS include
an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards. Furthermore, an
additional provision will be added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer must apply the provisions from
IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when identifying assumed liabilities
within the scope of these standards. The content of the accounting rules for business combinations
will not change.

The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items
produced while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognised
with the associated costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not
permissible.

The amendments to IAS 37 pertain to the definition of the cost a company includes when
determining if a contract will cause losses. Accordingly, settlement costs are all costs that would
not be uncured without the contract (incremental cost) as well as other costs directly attributable to
the contract.

The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial
Instruments, whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and
vice versa are to be included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities.
Costs or fees paid to other third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor
amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 41
_Agriculture, and to the explanatory examples of IFRS 16 Leases._

- IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including amendments to IFRS 17. On March 18, 2020, the IASB
decided to postpone the date on which IFRS 17 will enter into force to fiscal years beginning on or
after January 1, 2023. The amendment was issued on June 25, 2020. It has not yet been endorsed
by the European Union. IFRS 17 was issued on May 18, 2017 and provides requirements on
recognition, remeasurement and presentation of insurance contracts within the scope of the
standard. IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4.

- Amendments to IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements_ and IFRS Practice Statement 2 –
Making Materiality Judgements. The amendments were issued on February 12, 2021. The
amendments to IAS 1 _Disclosure of Accounting Policies_ requires that only material accounting
policies shall be disclosed in the notes in the future. Accounting policy information is material if it
relates to material transactions or events and there is a reason to consider materiality (for example
a change in accounting policy). The guidelines in IFRS Practice Statement 2 were accordingly
adjusted. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1,
2023 – subject to endorsement by the European Union.


-----

- Amendments to IAS 8 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._ The
amendments issued on February 12, 2021, clarify how entities can better distinguish between
changes resulting from changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. For
this purpose, accounting estimates are defined as “monetary amounts in financial statements that
are subject to measurement uncertainty”. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year
beginning on or after January 1, 2023 – subject to endorsement by the European Union.

We are currently evaluating the impact of the application of those standards according to the required
application date in the financial years 2022 to 2023 on the consolidated financial statements. Early
adoption of the standards before endorsement by the European Union is not planned.

**_Use of estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements_**

The extent of the assets, liabilities and provisions, contingencies and other financial obligations shown
in the consolidated financial statements depends to a certain extent on estimates or assumptions.
These are based on the circumstances and assessments prevailing on the balance sheet date, and
accordingly also influence the amount of the income and expenses shown for the respective financial
periods. Such assumptions relate to the definition of the useful lives of depreciable fixed assets or
intangible assets, the measurement of provisions and other assets or obligations. Due consideration is
given to factors of uncertainty for the purpose of establishing the values; however, actual results may
differ from the original estimates.

Areas which are particularly complex or in which extensive estimates are necessary or in which the
estimates or assumptions which have been made have a major impact on the consolidated financial
statements are explained under “Estimates and assumptions” in section (3) of these notes.

**(3)** **Accounting policies and valuation methods**

The consolidated financial statements of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. have been prepared on the historical
cost basis except for derivative financial instruments measured at fair value and except for provisions
for pensions and similar obligations that are measured at present value of the defined benefit obligation
less fair value of plan assets.

**a)** **Scope of consolidation**

The scope of consolidation is based on the application of IFRS 10. According to IFRS 10, a group
consists of a parent entity and the subsidiaries controlled by the parent. “Control” of an investee
assumes the simultaneous fulfilment of the following three criteria: (1) the parent company holds
decision-making power over the relevant activities of the investee (2) the parent company has rights to
variable returns from the investee (3) the parent company can use its decision-making power to affect
the variable returns.

**b)** **Balance sheet date**

The financial statements of the consolidated companies are prepared as of the balance sheet date of
the consolidated financial statements (December 31).

**c)** **Uniform valuation**

The assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements for the companies which
have been integrated are recognised and valued uniformly in accordance with the principles described
in this document.


-----

**d)** **Capital consolidation**

Capital is consolidated at the time of acquisition date using the acquisition method when control over
subsidiaries is transferred to the Group. The first step is to measure all identifiable assets acquired and
(contingent) liabilities assumed with their fair values at the acquisition date. The group recognises any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable
net assets. The consideration transferred is netted with the proportionate revalued shareholders’ equity
which has been acquired. Any differences which result from this process are capitalised as goodwill
and are written down only in the event of an impairment. If the proportionate amount of the acquisition
of net assets measured at fair value exceeds the costs of purchase of the business combination, the
identification and valuation of the identified assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired
company as well as the measurement of the costs of purchase of the business combination are
reassessed. Any difference remaining after the reassessment is recognised directly in the statement of
profit or loss. The acquisition-related costs incurred for carrying out a business combination are
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred.

**e)** **Business combination under common control**

A business combination involving entities under common control is a transfer of net assets or an
exchange of equity interests between entities or businesses, that are ultimately non-transitorilly
controlled by the same party both before and after the business combination. A transaction in which a
parent company contributes its ownership interests or the net assets of a wholly owned subsidiary to
the capital reserves of another subsidiary, falls into the definition of a business combination under
common control. A common-control transaction is similar to a business combination for the entity that
receives the net assets or equity interests. However, as there is no change in control of the net assets
from the perspective of the ultimate parent or the controlling shareholder level, such a transaction is not
governed by IFRS 3 and there is no other specific guidance in the IFRSs. Hence, management needs
to use judgement to develop an accounting policy, that provides relevant and reliable information in
accordane with IAS 8. Interpretation of IFRSs adresses the accounting for common control transactions
from the perspective of the entity that receives the net assets or equity interests and requires the
receiving entity to recognise the assets and liabilities transferred either at their fair value or at their
carrying amounts in the financial statements of the entity that transfers the net assets on the date of
transfer (‘predecessor value method’), rather than at fair value. The consolidated financial statements
for the combined group can then be prepared as a continuation of the accounting acquirer’s financial
statements, without the recognition of an additional goodwill, through a retrospective restatement of
comparative financial information, as if the combination had occured at the beginning of the earliest
comparative period presented. CABB has chosen to account for the assets and liabilities transferred at
their carrying amount and as a continuation of the accounting acquirer’s financial statements. Thus,
results of operations for the reporting period comprises those of the previously separate entities
combined from the beginning of the reporting period to the date the transfer is completed and those of
the combined operations from that date to the end of the period.

**f)** **Eliminations**

Internal balances and transactions within the Group as well as gains and losses from internal
transactions within the Group are eliminated as parts of the process of preparing the consolidated
financial statements.

**g)** **Segment reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the
management of CABB Group that makes strategic decisions.


-----

**h)** **Foreign currency translation**

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in thousand Euros. Items included in the financial
statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).

In the financial statements of the individual Group companies, transactions in foreign currency are
translated into the respective functional currency using the spot rate prevailing on the dates of the
transaction. Monetary items which are not denominated in the functional currencies of the subsidiaries
are translated on the balance sheet date using the rate applicable at the end of the year. The resulting
currency gains and losses are recognised directly in the financial result.

The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the Euro are translated using
the year-end reference date rate into the reporting currency (Euro), which is also the functional currency
of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. Expenses and income are translated using at the rates on the dates of the
transactions approximated by the average rates. All cumulative differences resulting from the currency
translation of the shareholders’ equity of foreign subsidiaries attributable to changes in the exchange
rates are shown directly in other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

**i)** **Revenue recognition**

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised in the amount of the consideration the Group
expects to receive in exchange for goods or services when control of the agreed-upon goods or services
and the benefits obtainable from them is available to the customer. This is done on the basis of customer
contracts and the performance obligations contained therein, which are individually identified. The
transaction price is then determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract. Finally,
revenue is recognised for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the
transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service is provided and the customer gains
control either over time or at a point in time. Control lies with the customer if the customer can
independently determine the use of and consume the benefit derived from a product or servies.
Revenues from products are recognized at a point in time based on an overall assessment of the
existence of a right of payment, the allocation of ownership rights, the transfer of physical possession,
the transfer of risks and rewards, and acceptance by the customer; this is generally the case upon
delivery.

Within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, revenues for the product group “Exclusives”, are
recognised over time, whereby for certain contracts within the product group “Exclusives”, the
performance obligation consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities in exchange of a
fixed remuneration, which is classified as a “stand ready obligation”.

Within the business unit Acetyls, customer contracts generally only give rise to a single performance
obligation in each case, which is to be fulfilled at a certain point in time based. This is generally the case
upon delivery.

**j)** **Cost of sales**

Cost of sales comprises the costs of materials, personnel expenses, proportionate depreciation and
amortisation, repairs and maintenance, energy, analysis and ecology, production overheads, plant
overheads as well as costs of packaging the products.

**k)** **Distribution and logistics expenses**

Distribution and logistics expenses comprise the costs of personnel expenses, proportionate
depreciation on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as transport costs.

**l)** **Research and development**

Research costs are recognised immediately as expense when they are incurred. They comprise wages
and salaries, cost of materials, proportionate depreciation on property, plant and equipment and
overheads. Development costs are only capitalised if, on the basis of various criteria, it is probable that
the capitalised amount will be covered by future income.

**m)** **Financial result**

This item contains interest income and expenses as well as foreign currency gains and losses. Interest
income and expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method.

**n)** **Borrowing costs**

The process of the acquisition, construction or production of intangible assets or property, plant and
equipment does not cover a period of more than one year. Accordingly, no borrowing costs have been
capitalised as part of the costs of purchase or production costs.

**o)** **Goodwill**

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value
of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

Goodwill is only written down in the event of an impairment. The value of goodwill is subject to an annual
impairment test and is also reviewed if there is any indication of an impairment. The goodwill impairment
test is carried out on the basis of cash-generating units (CGUs) by comparing the recoverable amount
with the carrying amount. The Acetyls and Custom Manufacturing units have been identified as cashgenerating units (the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes) which carry goodwill.

The carrying value of the CGUs containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which
is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised
immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

**p)** **Intangible assets**

Acquired intangible assets – excluding goodwill as well as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life
– are measured at cost of purchase less accumulated straight-line depreciation and eventually less
accumulated impairment losses. The respective useful life is the length of the underlying agreement
and the probable utilisation of the potential use of the intangible asset.

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognised if the recoverable amount
is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of
disposal and the value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the
lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating units). If the reasons


-----

for an impairment are no longer applicable, corresponding write-ups are recognised. Depending on the
type of the intangible asset, depreciation is shown under Costs of sales, Distribution and logistics
expenses, Research and development expenses or General and administrative expenses.

A European Community law concerning chemicals and the reliable handling of chemicals came into
force on June 1, 2007. This law governs the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of
chemicals (REACH). REACH requires the registration of certain substances. The companies of the
CABB Group incur costs within the framework of this registration procedure. These costs are capitalised
as intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 _Intangible Assets, and are depreciated over their_
estimated useful life of twelve years using the straight-line method.

Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method. The average periods of amortisation are
as follows:

**Amortisation on intangible** **in years**
**assets**

Capitalised REACH costs 12
Customer relations 5 - 15
Technology 5
Software 3

**q)** **Government grants**

Government grants related to the acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment reduce
the acquisition or construction cost of the respective assets. Other government grants or government
assistance are recognised immediately as other operating income or treated as deferred income or
treated as deferred income and released over the underlying period.

**r)** **Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost of purchase or cost of production less
accumulated depreciation recognised over the standard useful life and eventually less accumulated
impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of
the items. The costs of production of an asset comprise the directly attributable costs as well as
reasonable amounts of material and production overheads. The revaluation method is not used.

Each item of property, plant and equipment with a significant purchase value in relation to the overall
value of the asset is depreciated separately. If a significant item of property, plant and equipment has
a useful life and a depreciation method which are identical to those applicable for another part of the
same asset, these parts are combined for the purpose of determining the depreciation cost.

Property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. Land is not depreciated.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of
each reporting year.

The average periods of depreciation are as follows:

**Depreciation on property,** **in years**
**plant and equipment**

Buildings and improvements 12 - 40
Technical equipment, plant 5 - 15
and machinery

IT and other equipment 3 - 15
Vehicles 5 - 10

Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognised
if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of


-----

fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating
units). The assessment is made on the basis of the present value of the cash flows expected in the
future less the expected costs for removing an installation. Impairments are recognised in the amount
of the difference between the previous carrying amount and the discounted future cash flows. If the
reason for an impairment is no longer applicable, corresponding write-ups are recognised. Gains and
losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are
recognised within Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the consolidated statement of profit or
loss.

**s)** **Assets held for sale**

Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for-sale
if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing
use.

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair
value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill and then
to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories,
financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, which continue to be measured in
accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as
held-for-sale or held-for-distribution and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are
recognised in other income or other expenses.

Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer
amortised or depreciated.

**t)** **Leases**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is,
or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period
of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at
the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at of before the
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less
any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straightline-method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use
asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on
the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically
reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at
the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot
be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: (a) fixed
payments, including in-substance fixed payments; (b) variable lease payments that depend on an index
or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) amounts expected
to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and (d) the exercise price under a purchase option that
the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group
reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless
the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a


-----

change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee,
or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination
option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.
The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in
‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘loans and borrowings’ in the statement of financial
position.

The Group has elected to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that
have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and
lease liabilities for low-value assets, and recognises the lease payments associated with these leases
as an expense on straight-line basis over the lease term.

Assets used by the Group as lessee under operating lease arrangements are not capitalised. The lease
payments to be made are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line
basis over the period of the lease.

A finance lease is defined as a lease in which essentially all risks and rewards of an asset which are
associated with ownership of the asset are transferred to the lessee. Assets used under finance lease
arrangements are shown at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of
minimum lease payments. The lease payment to be made is broken down into repayment of principal
and an interest component. The repayment of principal reduces the liability, whereas the interest
component is reported as interest expense. Depreciation is recognised over the economic useful life or
the shorter life of the lease. The payment obligations resulting from the future lease instalments are
shown under financial liabilities. Details of the leases are set out in the notes (17).

**u)** **Financial instruments**

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in
the consolidated statement of financial position, when CABB becomes a party of a financial instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been
transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash
equivalents, and derivatives with positive fair values. Financial assets are recognised in the
consolidated statement of financial position when CABB becomes a party to a financial instrument.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which
the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. The amount at which a financial asset is initially
recognised comprises its fair value and in most cases the transaction costs.

The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow
condition (the “solely payments of principle and interest” criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow
characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model
used for managing financial asset portfolios. Based on these two criteria, the following measurement
categories are applicable:

_Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash_
flow are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition
established in IFRS 9. At CABB, derivatives are allocated to this measurement category, for example.
CABB does not generally exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of
financial instruments not to be measure at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow
condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances.

_Financial assets measured at amortised cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to_
cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest


-----

on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow conditions in IFRS 9, to the extent
that the asset is held with the intention of collection the expected contractual cash flows over its term.
At CABB, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivables, as well as miscellaneous
assets and certain securities.

Initial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value (except for trade accounts receivables,
which are measured at their transaction price), which usually corresponds to the transaction price at
the time of acquisition. Impairments are recognised for expected credit losses in both initial and
subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence of any default event for financial assets
measured at amortised costs and contract assets. If the counterparty is considered as having defaulted,
an individual valuation allowance is generally recognised for the financial assets measured at amortised
cost. In addition, a valuation allowance must be recognised when the contractual conditions that form
the basis for the receivable are changed through renegotiation in such a way that the present value of
the future cash flows decreases. The extend of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit
risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset
has increased significantly since initial recognition, expected credit losses are generally recognised over
the lifetime of the asset. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period,
impairments are generally only recognised for the 12-month expected credit losses. By contrast, under
the simplified approach for determining expected credit losses permitted by IFRS 9, impairments for
receivables such as trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the
receivable concerned.

The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than
30 days past due. At CABB, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal information
and external rating information on the respective counterparts. A significant increase in the
counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The
significance of the increase in the credit risk is not reviewed for trade accounts receivable. Furthermore,
it is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have
increased significantly. Regional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and
expectations are taken into account when assessing the need for a valuation allowance as part of the
calculation of expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances. In addition, CABB uses
internal and external ratings and the assessments of credit insurers, when available. Individual valuation
allowances are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks.
Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortised costs,
are likewise considered when calculating valuation allowances. Bank guarantees and letters of credit
are used to an immaterial extent. Expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances are only
calculated for those receivables that were not covered by insurance or other collateral. The valuation
allowances for receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognised in excess of the
amount of the deductible. A decrease in valuation allowances due, for example, to a reduction in the
credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after the valuation allowance is recorded in
profit or loss. Reversals of valuation allowances may not exceed amortised cost, less any expected
future credit losses.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets measured at amortised cost are
credit impaired. This is the case if one or more events that have an impact on the estimated future cash
flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes
the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the debtor, a breach of contract such a
default or being more than 90 days past due; if it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or
other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of
financial difficulties. Loss allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The
gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations
of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For individual customers, the Group
has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 180 days past due
based on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets. The Group expects no significant


-----

recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject
to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

_Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include all assets with_
contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9,
to the extent that the asset is not just held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash
flows of its term, but also generating cash flows from its sale. At CABB, no contract incurred throughout
the financial year 2020, which fulfils the criteria of described measurement category. CABB does not
exercise the option to subsequently measure equity instruments through other comprehensive income.

Assets measured at fair valued through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value,
which usually corresponds to the nominal value of the securities, allocated to its category at the time of
acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the time value are
recognised in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of income when the asset
is disposed of.

Impairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are
calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortised cost and
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The following measurement categories are used for financial liabilities:

_Financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided_
these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial
recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent
measurement is recognised in profit or loss at amortised cost using the effective interest method. At
CABB, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial liabilities are measured at
amortised cost.

_Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities._
These are likewise measured at the value of initial recognition. The latter also represents the
measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently
measure financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or has
expired.

Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial
instrument. If IFRS requires separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its
host contract and measured at fair value. If IFRS 9 does not provide for separation, the hybrid instrument
is accounted for at fair value in its entirety.

CABB uses the following valuation techniques for determining the fair values of financial assets and
financial liabilities:

Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded
in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present
value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of embedded
derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte Carlo simulation. For
the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is calibrated such that the model
reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (Bourse de
Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing model also considers the risk-free
interest rate as another paramater.

These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely
as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair
value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.


-----

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the
same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
measurement.

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
period during which the change has occurred. As in prior year there were no transfers between the
different levels of the fair value hierarchies in the financial reporting period ended December 31, 2020.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the
amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. As of December 31, 2020, such contracts did not exist.

**v)** **Taxes**

The current taxes on income are calculated using the current or substantively enacted tax rate in relation
to the taxable income of the individual group companies. Management establishes provisions in
situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation as appropriate on the basis of
amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

The deferred taxes on income are accrued on the basis of the current or substantively enacted local
tax rate expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income
tax liability is settled. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all
temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the
tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of
goodwill. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from
investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in
the forseeable future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary
difference can be utilised.

A combined tax rate of 24.94% is used in Luxembourg. Country-specific tax rates are used for the other
companies.

Deferred tax assets resulting from losses carried forward and temporary differences are only recognised
if it is probable that these can be offset against future taxable profits.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised as tax expenses, unless they relate to items which have
been recognised directly as other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if they have the same maturity, if there is
a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and if they are due
in relation to the same tax authority by the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there
is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**w)** **Inventories**

Inventories are carried at cost of purchase or cost of production. Cost is determined using moving
average value. If net realisable values are lower, inventories are recognised at these lower values. The
net realisable value is equivalent to the sales proceeds attainable in the normal course of business,
less the directly attributable costs up to the point at which the inventories are sold. Costs of production
comprise the directly attributable costs as well as reasonable amounts of material and production
overheads assuming a normal level of utilisation of the relevant production facilities to the extent that
they are incurred in connection with the manufacturing process. Costs of the Company’s pension
scheme, for social facilities of the operation and voluntary social benefits of the Company as well as
costs of administration are also taken into consideration to the extent that they are attributable to
manufacturing. Financing costs are not included in costs of production.


-----

Raw materials and supplies, including technical material and packagings, are measured at the lower of
cost of purchase and net realisable value. A write-down is recognised to reduce the value of such raw
materials and supplies to a figure which is lower than the cost of purchase only if the net realisable
value of the finished products which include the raw materials and supplies is probably lower than the
cost of production of the finished products.

**x)** **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present
value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.
Provisions for pensions are based on actuarial computations made according to the projected unit credit
method, which applies, among others, the following valuation parameters: future developments in
compensation, pensions and inflation, the expected performance of plan assets, employee turnover
and the life expectancy of beneficiaries. The resulting obligations are discounted by reference to market
yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate fixed rate bonds with an AA rating that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Actuarial gains and losses resulting from periodic recalculation are recognised in other comprehensive
income. They result from the variance between the actual development in pension obligations and
pension assets and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year as well as the updating of
actuarial assumptions. The calculation of pension provisions is based on actuarial reports.

The current service costs which are associated with the work carried out in the reporting period are
shown as personnel expenses in the costs of those functions in which the employees are operating,
except where included in the cost of an asset. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit
obligation and the fair value of plan assets both at the beginning of the year. This cost is included in
financial expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension
insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further payment
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee
benefit expense when they are due.

**y)** **Other provisions**

Other provisions are recognised if a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past
event, an outflow of economic resources is probable and the corresponding amount can be reliably
estimated. Provisions are recognised to the extent of the best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the present obligation.

Provisions are recognised for environmental protection measures and risks if, as a result of a past
event, there is a current legal or constructive obligation to carry out measures.

The probable settlement amount of non-current provisions is discounted, if the discounting effect is of
a material nature. In this case, the probable settlement amount is recognised with its present value. The
increase of the discounted amount resulting from the passage of time and the effect deriving from any
change in the discount rate are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other
comprehensive income and classified as financial income or expense.

Provisions for service anniversary payments are mainly calculated in accordance with actuarial
principles. For semi-retirement agreements which have been concluded, the wage and salary payments
to be made during the passive phase of the semi-retirement arrangement are accumulated in
instalments, approved supplemental payments are accrued in instalments until the end of the exemption
phase at the latest.


-----

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal
retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The group recognised termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the
group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.

**z)** **Financial risk management**

CABB Group is exposed to numerous financial risks within its business activities. These risks comprise
market, credit, interest rate and exchange rate risks. For details, please refer to note (35) (Financial risk
management).

**aa) Estimates and assumptions**

The process of preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with the IFRS requires
assessments, assumptions and estimates with regard to the application of accounting policies, and also
requires management to make assumptions regarding future developments. These assessments,
assumptions and estimates are based on experience and other factors which are considered to be
reasonable under the given circumstances. Actual outcomes and results within the next financial
periods may differ materially from current expectations. Hence, a change in the underlying estimates
and assumptions could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the affected asset or
liability.

Therefore, estimates and assumptions are continuously reviewed. Changes in accounting-relevant
estimates are recognised in the reporting period in which the assessment is revised, and also in future
reporting periods if these future reporting periods are affected by the revised estimates.

In particular, the following items in the consolidated statement of financial position have been affected
by the use of estimates:

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill resulting from the capital consolidation is recognised in the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2020 (see note (18)). Goodwill has to be tested for impairment at
least once every year. For the purpose of the impairment test, long-term cash flow forecasts are to be
compiled for cash-generating units within the context of the expected development of the Group and
the overall economic trends. Estimates of cost of capital are used to determine the pre-tax discount rate
for discounting the cash flows. As these estimates are continuously reviewed, potentially possible
changes might require an adjustment to the carrying amount of the goodwill.

**_Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets_**

In the course of the purchase price allocation following the business combination with CABB Group,
items of property, plant and equipment (see note (19)) and intangible assets (see note (18)) were
measured at fair value. For this valuation an external expert was engaged. Management determined
the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement used by the
expert.

The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at
the end of each reporting period. These assets are tested once a year for indications of impairments. If
there are any such indications, estimates of the expected future cash flows from the utilisation and
potential disposal of these assets are made for assessing the impairment. The actual cash flows may
differ appreciably from the discounted future cash flows which are based on these estimates. Factors
such as a change in the planned utilisation of buildings, machinery and equipment, technical aging or
utilisation levels of installations which are lower than original forecasts may reduce the useful service
life or may result in an impairment.


-----

**_Pension provisions_**

The valuation of provisions for pensions and similar obligations is influenced by assumptions regarding
the future development of wages and salaries or pensions as well as discount rates.

In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst
Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension fund (Pensionskasse –
PK) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed
via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd. The calculations of the liabilities recognised with
regard to these facilities are based on statistical and actuarial calculations of the actuaries. In particular,
the present value of the defined-benefit obligation depends on assumptions such as the discount rate
and the pension growth rate used for calculating the present value of the future pension obligations.
Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation
of the present value of the future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged
by the Group also use statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured
parties for their assumptions. The discount rate for the actuarial calcuations of the German and Finnish
defined-benefit obligations was determined by applying the Mercer Pension Yield Curve Approach
(MYC). The data and methodology used to create the MYC is reviewed periodically by Mercer to ensure
consistency and improved estimates.

**_Environmental provisions_**

The provision recognised for environmental protection measures (see note (27)) represents the best
estimate of the expected outflow of funds. The provision relates to expected costs of rehabilitating toxic
waste sites in Switzerland as well as waste disposal at the production location in Kokkola. The future
development of environmental costs depends on many factors including the rehabilitation method to be
used, the extent of the rehabilitation measures as well as the shares attributable to the Group and to
external parties.

Due to uncertainties related to the prediction of environmental rehabilitation costs, it is possible that
additional costs may occur which exceed the recognised provision. Based on the latest available
information, management considers that the provision as of December 31, 2020 is adequate.

**(4)** **Scope of Consolidation**

The scope of consolidation comprises Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., with registered office in Luxembourg,
as well as all domestic and international subsidiaries. Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. directly or indirectly
owns a majority of voting rights in these companies. There are no joint ventures or associated
companies.

In addition to Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. as the parent company, the consolidated financial statements
as of December 31, 2020 include three Luxembourg and fourteen non-Luxembourg companies in which
Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. has a dominating influence over financial and operating policy, based on the
concept of control. This is generally the case where Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. holds, directly or
indirectly, a majority of the voting rights (no difference between percentage of holding and voting right).

On August 27, 2018, Monitchem S.à r.l., Luxembourg, the ultimate parent company that is wholly owned
by Permira Funds, founded a new intermediate holding company, Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l.,
Luxembourg, to acquire Jayhawk’s business activities in the United States. The entity was
retrospectively included in the consolidation perimeter at the date of its incorporation (August 27, 2018)
in accordance with common control accounting described in the following.

On August 27, 2018, Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l., Luxembourg, subscribed to the entire common stocks
in Kansas HoldCo Inc., (USA), a new intermediate holding company formed on August 9, 2018.

Kansas HoldCo Inc. (USA), subscribed to the entire common stocks in Kansas HoldCo 1 Inc., (USA), a
new intermediate holding company, formed on August 17, 2018, in order to acquire the share capital of
Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation (USA).

Effective November 1, 2018, Monitchem S.à r.l.’s wholly owned indirect subsidiary Kansas HoldCo 1,
Inc. (Delaware/USA) acquired the entire shares of Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation (Nevada/
USA), a company primarily involved in the Custom Manufacturing business and the production of
specialty fine chemicals. The entity was retrospectively included in the consolidation perimeter as of
November 1, 2018.

On October 7, 2019, Monitchem S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) (the “Contributor”), a wholly owned subsidiay of
Permira Funds, and Monitchem Midco S.à r.l., the direct parent company of Monitchem Holdco 1
S.à r.l., entered into a contribution agreement, pursuant to which the Contributor transferred the entire
shares of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg), to Monitchem Midco S.à. r.l. (Luxembourg), which
in turn contributed such shares to the capital reserves of its indirect subsidiary Monitchem Holdco 2
S.A. (Luxembourg), through a contribution in kind without issue of shares. The shares were then
contributed down the chain of subsidiaries, such that Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) is
ultimately held by CABB Europe GmbH (Germany). As this transaction involves only entities, which are
ultimately controlled by Permira funds, the Group decided to account for this transaction in the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, by applying the predecessor
value method through a retrospective restatement of comparative financial information, as if the
transaction had occurred in the financial year 2018 (see note (3e)). The difference between the fair
value of the contributed shares as per October 7, 2019 (kEUR 59,629) and the Subscribed capital and
the Share premium of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) amounts to kEUR -11,376 and is
included in the shareholders’ equity attributable to the shareholders of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A.. This
Contribution reserve is disclosed as a separate component of the Reserves in the Consolidated
statement of changes in equity since the year ended December 31, 2018.

On December 12, 2019, the shareholders of CABB – Jinwei Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co. Ltd.,
Zhanghuang Town (PRC) decided to convert parts of the outstanding principal and accrued interests

amounts of the shareholder loans into equity. In conjunction with the capital increase, the proportion of
ownership interests held by non-controlling entities decreased from 33.0% to 32.4%.

Although CABB Nordic Holding S.à r.l. is situated in Luxembourg, the entity’s functional currency is
Swiss Franc, as the debt and equity financing is denominated in Swiss Francs.

**(5)** **Segment information**

The format for reporting the activities of the CABB Group by operating segment is by business unit.
This classification corresponds to the way in which the information is reviewed by CABB Group’s
management for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance.

The business activities of the CABB Group are organised in the following reported operating segments:

- The business unit Custom Manufacturing focuses on the production of exclusives, which are active
ingredients and advanced intermediates customised for individual customers operating in the
agrochemcial, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries.

- The business unit Acetyls is focused on the production of monochloroacetic acid, or MCA, acetyl
derivatives and co-products, which are used in a variety of applications in the agrochemical, food,
pharmaceutical and personal care industries.

No operating segments have been aggregated in arriving at the reportable segments of the Group.

**a) Segment revenue**

Revenue between segments are carried out at arm’s length. The revenue from external parties reported
to the chief operating decision-maker is measured consistent to the manner applied in the Consolidated
statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income.

**kEUR** **2020** **2019**

**Revenue**

Custom Manufacturing 329,650 348,576
Acetyls 175,682 190,120
Inter-segment Eliminations -13,045 -15,432
**Total revenue from external customers** **492,287** **523,264**

**b) Segment EBITDA**

In determining the segment results, CABB Group applies the same principles of recognition and
measurement as in the consolidated financial statements. The Group measures the performance of its
segments on the basis of a segment income variable referred to by Internal Control and Reportings as
“Operating EBITDA”. This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditures from
the operating segments such as restructuring costs, consulting expenses. Furthermore, valuation
effects on inventory items resulting from the purchase price allocation carried out as part of the business
combination of the CABB Group are not included within the “Operating EBITDA”.

For the reconciliation of segment information to the consolidated financial statements of the CABB
Group, the Group's holding costs are reported under Corporate Expenses. Interest income and
expenses are not allocated to the segments as these are managed by the central treasury function.

**c) Segment Net Working Capital**

The amounts reported to CABB Group’s management with respect to Operating Net Working Capital

**d) Segment additions to non-current assets**

Amounts provided to the management of the CABB Group for additions to non-current assets are
reported consistently with the consolidated statement of changes in non-current assets, except for
additions to non-current assets recognised in connection with IFRS 16 "Leases", which are therefore
not included in the following table:

Contract liabilities relating to the Exclusives 12,438 10,684
Contract liabilities relating to advances received 0 24
**Total contract liabilities** **12,438** **10,708**

Within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, revenue for certain products within the product group
“Exclusives”, are recognised over time, whereby for certain contracts the performance obligation
consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities in exchange of a fixed remuneration, which
is classified as a “stand ready obligation”. Within the business unit Acetyls, customer contracts generally
only give rise to a single performance obligation in each case, which is to be fulfilled at a certain point
in time.

Contract liabilities primarily relate to non-refundable up-front capital recovery fees which are paid by the
customer at the beginning of the project, upon an agreed capacity expansion. CABB is amortising the
capital recovery fees received from customers over the term of the customer contract. The weightedaverage expected period at December 2020 was 3,4 years (2019: 3,8 years).

Bond interest expenses increased by kEUR 7,326 versus prior year from kEUR 32.534 to kEUR 39,860,
driven by a higher outstanding nominal value of the Notes and interest rates.

Other interest expenses mainly include tranaction costs of kEUR 4,123 (2019: kEUR 14,624), which
are amortised over the term of the Notes (see Note (28)). Subsequently to the successfully completed
refinancing, accrued financing expenses of kEUR 12,730 relating to the former financing agreements
were recognised in the financial year 2019.

The net interest expense from underfunded pension plans and similar obligations declined year-on-year
as a result of the lower interest rate used to determine expenses for pension benefits compared with
the previous year.

Other financial expenses mainly comprise commitment fees for revolving credit facilities kEUR 937
(2019: kEUR 1,153) and the bank guarantee line. In the financial year 2019, an early redemption
premium of kEUR 3,008 (2020: kEUR 0), incurred in conjunction with the settlement of Senior Notes
was recognised.

from the foreign currency translation of group-internal transactions (predominately financing activities)
in an amount of kEUR -2,899 (2019: kEUR 4,304)

**(16) Taxes on income**

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. and CABB Nordic Holding S.à r.l. are subject to
Luxembourg corporate income tax rate of 17.0% (2019: 17.0%), leading to a combined overall tax rate
of 24.94% (2019: 24.94%), which is taking into account a 7.0% (2019: 7.0%) employment fund
contribution/solidarity surtax on the corporate income tax rate, plus a municipal business tax on profits
of 6.75% (2019: 6.75%). Since the Group operates across the world, it is subject to income taxes in
several different tax jurisdictions with income tax rates in the range from 18.0% to 29.59% (2019: 20.0%
to 29.60%).

Taxes on income for the financial year 2020 are broken down as follows:

**kEUR** **2020** **2019**

Current income taxes -5,262 -4,454
Income from deferred taxes 5,672 21,151
**Taxes on income** **410** **16,697**

On November 24, 2019, numerous changes to the tax law were enacted in Switzerland, including a
graduated reduction of the corporate income tax rate over a period of five years of currently 18%
(December 31, 2019: 20.7%) to maximal effective 13.45%. This change resulted in a gain of
kEUR 1,069 (2019: kEUR 14,744) related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of
the Group’s consolidated Swiss entity, CABB AG, being recognised during the financial year ended
December 31, 2020.

The effective tax rate of the Group differs from Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A.’s tax rate of 24.94% (2019:
24.94%) as follows:

**Taxes on income** **16,697** **-198.7**

Non-deductible interest expenses predominately incur within the German and Finnish tax jurisdiction,
which limits the deductibility of interest expenses to 30.0% or 25.0% of the EBITDA defined for the
purpose of the interest rate cap regulation. The non-deductible portion of net interest expenses
amounted to kEUR 18,246 in the financial year 2020 (2019: kEUR 19,999). Although these amounts
may in principle be carried forward indefinitely and offset against future interest income, no deferred tax
assets in respect to interest tax loss carry-forwards in the amount of kEUR 110,104 (December 31,


-----

2019: kEUR 91,859) were recognised, as the prerequisites for their usability will not be fullfilled within
the foreseeable future. Furthermore, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax
loss carry-forwards amounting to kEUR 17,036 (2019: kEUR 14,953), as it is not probable that sufficient
taxable profit will be available against which they may be utilised. Of these tax losses carried forward,
kEUR 1,510 (2019: kEUR 2,025) will expire within two years, kEUR 1,668 will expire in three years
(2019: kEUR 1,948), kEUR 3,368 in four years (2019: kEUR 3,440), kEUR 7,089 in five years
(2019: kEUR 7,241) and kEUR 3,401 in 13 years or thereafter (2019: kEUR 299).

In conjunction with actuarial gains/ losses of defined-benefit plans, deferred income taxes amounting
to kEUR -286 (2019: kEUR -2,167) are included within other comprehensive income (OCI).

Deferred taxes resulting from temporary differences tax balances and with balances according to
IFRS are broken down as follows:


-----

(1) The amounts disclosed in column “Recognised in Other comprehensive income (OCI)” of the table above
includes effects resulting from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations, that may be
reclassified to profit or loss; and income taxes relating to actuarial gains and losses from defined-benefit plans,
that will not be reclassified to profit or loss subsequently.

Custom Manufacturing 131,267 131,352
Acetyls 59,488 59,488
**Goodwill** **190,755** **190,840**

The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is calculated based on the fair value less costs to
sell approach. The underlying cash flow projection is based on past experiences, current results and
on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. Market assumptions, such as the
development of the overall economy and the market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific information sources. The fair value measurement was categorised as
a level 3 fair value.

The financial projections were approved by management and consist of a detailed planning period of
five years. A perpetual growth rate of 1.0% (2019: 1.0%) for the business unit Acetyls and 1.3% (2019:
1.3%) for the Custom Manufacturing unit is applied for the period beyond the five-year period and does
not exceed the long-term average growth rate for both businesses.

For the business unit Acetyls, an average revenue growth of 4.1% (2019: 1.7%) and an average
EBITDA-margin of 22.0% (2019: 20.0%) are assumed. The future cash flows generated by the business
unit Acetyls are discounted at a post-tax rate of 6.5% (2019: 6.8%).


-----

For the business unit Custom Manufacturing, an average revenue growth of 4.1% (2019: 4.8%) and an
average EBITDA-margin of 25.6% (2019: 26.7%) are assumed. The future cash flows generated by the
business unit Custom Manufacturing are discounted at a post-tax rate of 6.1% (2019: 6.6%). The
cashflow projection is influenced by the growth of the agrochemical market.

As of December 31, 2020, the recoverable amount of both business units exceed their carrying
amounts. Hence, no goodwill impairment is indicated.

Customer relations and technologies acquired in connection with the business combination of CABB
Group effective as of June 17, 2014, have been measured as part of the purchase price allocation
process; they are amortised over their expected useful life (between 7.9 and 13.8 years).

Amortisation of intangible assets is included in Cost of sales as well as in Distribution and logistics
expenses.

There are no material contractual obligations for acquiring intangible assets.

**(22) Other financial assets**

Other financial assets as of December 31, 2020 amount to kEUR 3,036 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0)
and relate to a securitisation programme in the course of which, the Group sells without recourse a
portion of its trade receivables to a structured entity. The Group transfers the contractual rights to
receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a revolving basis at their nominal value less a retained
reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is disclosed within other financial assets and represents
the Group’s right to receive this amount in cash once the trade receivables sold have been settled by
the customers. The carrying amount of trade receivables transferred under the securitisation
programme amounted to kEUR 23,844 as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0), of
which kEUR 23,285 have been derecognised (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0).

**(24) Cash and cash equivalents**

**(25) Capital**

**Share capital and share premium**

_Share capital_

Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. was established on May 9, 2014 with a subscribed capital of EUR 1,000 with
a nominal value of EUR 1 and 1,000 fully paid in shares.

All ordinary shares rank equally with regards to the Company’s residual assets. Holders of these shares
are entitled to dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at general
meetings of the Company

_Share premium_

The share premium results from a contribution in cash of kEUR 220,634 and contributions in kind
amounting to kEUR 71,170 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 71,170).

**Other Reserves**

_Contribution Reserve_

The contribution Reserve amounts to kEUR 11,376 and represents the difference between the
contribution amount of the equity investment in Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) as of October
7, 2019 (contribution date), and the nominal value of the Subscribed capital plus the Share premium of
Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) (See note 4).

_Legal reserve_

In accordance with Luxembourg company law, the Company is required to transfer a minimum of 5%
of its net profit for each financial year to a legal reserve. This requirement ceases to be necessary once
the balance on the legal reserve reaches 10% of the issued share capital. The legal reserve is not
available for distribution to the shareholders. As of December 31, 2020, the Company is in a loss
brought forward position. Therefore, no allocation to the legal reserve will be required.

_Foreign currency translation_

The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the
financial statements of foreign operations.

**Capital management**

The objective of the Group is to maintain an adequate capital base in order to maintain the confidence
of lenders and the market and also in order to strengthen the future business development.

**(26) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

CABB Group provides its employees post-employment defined benefit plans. In Germany, retirement
benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss
employees of the Group are insured with the pension plan (Pensionskasse der CABB AG) of CABB
AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the
pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd., Ilmarinen (Finland).

The pension fund of CABB AG is organised as an independent registered trust (registrierte Stiftung)
and maintains a shift insurance plan and a regular pension plan. According to the deed of foundation,


-----

the trust has the purpose to provide benefits to retired employees of CABB AG in the form of pension
payments for life and in case of disability or death within the framework of the Occupational Pension
Act (Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge BVG).
Alternatively, the employee can request a lump-sum payment of his accrued capital. The level of
benefits provided depends in general on employees’ length of service and their salary for respective
service years.

According to the pension plan rules, the pension benefits are financed by contributions of the
employees, the employer and the fund. Art. 32 of the pension plan determines that in case the means
of the fund are insufficient to meet the defined contributions by the fund, those contributions have to be
made by the employer. Contributions to the Swiss pension fund are expected to remain stable in the
short to medium term as payments are based on fixed percentages of pensionable benefits. If there is
a funding shortfall, the Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) can implement measures including: changing
benefits, lowering the returns credited to employees and changing the conversion rate. If the measures
are not sufficient to improve the funding level, and as a last resort, the fund can ask the employer and
employees to make additional contributions to close the gap. CABB AG would then have to bear at
least half of any extra payments. Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans under IAS
19R, as although contribution levels are in fact “fixed”, there is a potential risk of extra payments in
future.

Basis for the investment of plan assets is the investment regulation of the foundation dated
December 10, 2013. This regulation ensures the compliance with Occupational Pensions Act (BVG)
and best possible return within acceptable risk profile. Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) and Investment
Commission (Anlagekommission) define the long term investment structure as well as objectives and
benchmarks for the investments. Only bonds with solid credit risk rating (at least "BBB-") are selected
for investments. At least 50% of all bond investments are made in bonds with rating of "AA-" and higher.
Investment guidance is reviewed on an annual basis. All persons involved in investment decisions for
plan assets or otherwise employed by the pension fund are subject to confidentiality obligations and
have to follow the ASIP (Swiss pension fund association) Charter.

The defined benefit plans in Finland, Germany and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to actuarial
risks such as:

- **Interest risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount**
rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in the bond interest
rate will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition the decrease in interest rate will
decrease interest expense; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the
plan assets.

- **Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to**
the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An
increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation.

- **Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the**
future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will
increase the defined benefit obligation.

In addition, defined benefit plans in Finland and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to the
investment risk: Decrease in the fair value of plan assets can create a plan deficit.

In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is calculated using the
actuarial valuation method for current one-off premiums or in accordance with the projected unit credit
method on the basis of specific parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the
present value of the pension obligation to show the funded statuts of the obligation. The extent of the
obligation as well as the plan assets are determined at regular intervals of not more than twelve months;
in the case of all defined-benefit plans, they are calculated every year as of December 31.


-----

Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling
are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation
are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits.

The following parameters have been used as the basis for determining the present value of the benefit
obligations as of December 31, 2020 for domestic and international companies:

Age- and gender-related fluctuation probabilities have been used.

The average duration of the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 is 14.5 years (December
31, 2019: 14.5 years).

The actuarial assumptions may differ from the actual results due to the change in market conditions
and economic climate, higher or lower retirement rates, longer or shorter lives of insured parties and
also other estimated factors. These differences can have an impact on the pension obligations
recognised in future reporting periods.

Amounts recognised in comprehensive income in respect of these defined benefit plans are as follows:

Miscellaneous 7,475 17,463
**Fair Value of plan assets** **192,225** **185,972**

The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are mainly determined based on quoted market
prices in active markets whereas the fair values of properties are not based on quoted market prices in
active markets.

For the financial year 2020, the actual income from plan assets amounted to kEUR 6,954 (2019:
kEUR 15,745) in Switzerland and to kEUR 1,872 (2019: kEUR 2,681) in Finland.

In 2020, additional employer contributions of kEUR 4,702 (2019: kEUR 4,590) were made into statutory
pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans).

Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount
rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based
on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting
period, while holding all other assumptions constant:

- If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligaton would decrease
by kEUR 17,113 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 16,873) (increase by kEUR 19,071; December 31,
2019: kEUR 18,803).


-----

- If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation
would increase by kEUR 14,829 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 14,600) (decrease by kEUR 13,707;
December 31, 2019: kEUR 13,485).

- If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would
increase by kEUR 1,128 (December 31, 2019: KEUR 1,178) (decrease by kEUR 1,093, December
31, 2019: kEUR 1,151).

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined
benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another
as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit
obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period,
which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the
statement of financial position.

The Group expects to make a contribution of kEUR 3,538 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 3,838) to the
defined benefit plans during the next financial year.

Provisions for environment and rehabilitation relate to the responsibility of the Group in relation to the
cost of asbestos remediation and the rehabilitating of legacy issues of three landfill sites in Switzerland
as well as waste disposal obligations in Finland. The rehabilitation costs are borne by the major waste
contributors of the past, whereby the share of CABB AG is defined in accordance with a fixed distribution
key. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of management for the future outflow of funds in
connection with the rehabilitation obligations. Although the estimations and assumptions are regularly
reviewed and updated, the actual outcome can significantly differ from the current best estimate. The
rehabilitation of the largest landfill site is completed, which leads to the next phase of renaturation of
the site.

Personnel obligations include short term employee benefits for holiday allowances and overtime
kEUR 3,523 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 3,760), premiums and bonus payments of kEUR 4,144

**(28) Notes**

The acquisition of the CABB Group was mainly financed by way of public Euro bonds which were issued
by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. in June 2014. On October 7, 2019, the
Group redeemed the existing indentures and issued the financial instruments described in the following.

The Senior Notes were issued by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., whereas the Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes were issued by Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. On the Floating Rate
Senior Secured Notes, the interest is payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15
and December 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2020. On the Fixed Rate Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Notes, interest is payable semianually in arrears on March 15 and September 15
in each year, commencing on March 15, 2020.

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes are guaranteed on a general
senior secured basis by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A., CABB Group GmbH, CABB Holding GmbH, CABB
GmbH, CABB Europe GmbH, CABB AG, CABB Nordic Holding S.à. r.l., CABB Finland Oy, CABB Oy,
Kansas HoldCo 1, Inc. and Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation. They are secured by first-ranking
security interests in the share capital of each of the guaranteeing CABB entities; certain material bank
accounts, intra-group loan receivables, certain material real estate owned by CABB AG and CABB Oy
and certain other assets of CABB Finland Oy, CABB Oy and Jayhawk.

The Senior Notes are guaranteed by the above mentioned CABB entities on a senior subordinated
basis. They are primarily secured by second-ranking security interests in the share capital of Monitchem
Holdco 3 S.A..

The Group may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes due
2025 at any time after September 15, 2020; the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes due 2025 on or after
September 15, 2021 and the Senior Notes due 2026 on or after September 14, 2022.

Such early redemption options are reported as embedded derivatives. Upon certain events defined as
constituting a change of control the bond issuers are required to make an offer to purchase the
outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest.

The notes agreement defines certain covenants which, among other things, restrict the ability of the
bond issuers and their subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends,
redeem capital stock or make certain investments, transfer or sell certain assets, merge or consolidate
with other entities or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Certain covenants will be suspended
if the relevant notes obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating.

The notes are recognised at their aggregate principal amounts plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Transaction costs, which are amortised over the term of the notes, are deducted in an amount of
kEUR 23,741 as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 27,875).

The market value of the Notes and the market value of embedded derivatives in the indenture are
categorised as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

(2) FVTPL : at fair value through profit or loss; Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting


-----

The following valuation techniques have been used for determining the fair values of financial assets
and financial liabilities:

   - **Market comparison technique (i.e. Notes): financial instruments with standard terms and**
conditions which are traded on active markets are valuated based on broker quotes. Similar
contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transations in similar
instruments.

   - **Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that**
are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated
considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves.

   - **Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of**
embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte
Carlo simulation. For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is
calibrated such that the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange (Bourse de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing
model also considers the risk-free interest rate as another paramater.

These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely
as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair
value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. There are no
financial instruments, which require a determination of fair values based on unobservable inputs
(level 3).

Derivative financial instruments (embedded derivatives in the indenture and interest rate swaps not
included in a designated hedging relationship) are categorised as “at fair value through profit or loss” in
accordance with IFRS 9. They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their
maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive
fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). The value of the embedded derivatives is
affected by the interest of the comparable market instrument on each potential exercise date and will
rise if the relevant interest rate declines and vice versa.

Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “at
amortised cost” under IFRS 9 as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly
have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference
date are approximately equivalent to the fair value.

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the interest income and expense, the
amortisation of arrangement fees, bank fees and other fees, the result from the translation of foreign
currencies and other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line financial
instruments at fair value through profit and loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments
measured at fair value through profit or loss which are not designated as hedging instruments in
accordance with IFRS 9.

**(35) Financial risk management**

The operations of the Group are exposed to liquidity, credit, interest rate and exchange rate risks. The
Group’s overall risk management seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial
performance. In November 2019, the Group joined a reverse factoring contract of one of its customers,
in the course of which trade receivables due from a major customer are settled through a bank.

Since June 2020, the Group sells without recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured
entity under an asset-backed securitisation programme. The financing volume is committed to a
maximum amount of kEUR 30,000. The structured entity is not controlled by CABB and therefore not
consolidated by the Group. The special purpose entity obtains its funding primarily from capital markets
through the issuance of commercial papers and has mandated the Group to service the receivables in
return for an at arm’s-length fee. The structured entity has the contractual right to terminate this service
agreement and may appoint as substitute servicer any other person. The Group transfers the
contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a revolving basis at their nominal
value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is presented as part of other
financial receivables and represents the Group’s right to receive this amount once the trade receivables
sold have been settled by the customers. To the extend to which the credit risk is retained by the Group
(continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and corresponding other financial liabilities are
recognised. The carrying amount of trade receivables transferred under the securitisation programme
amounted to kEUR 23,844 as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0), of which
kEUR 23,285 have been derecognised (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0); and kEUR 3,036 (December 31,
2019: kEUR 0), representing the retained reserve, is presented as part of other current financial
receivables. The carrying amount of trade receivables (classified as trade receivables) and the other
financial liability resulting from the continuing involvement amounted to kEUR 559 as of December 31,
2020 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0).

**Foreign currency risks**

The Group is exposed to changes in exchange rates leading to losses in the value of financial
instruments. Foreign currency risks from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing
rate of financial receivables, cash and financial liabilities including intercompany loans into the functional
currency of the respective consolidated entity. The foreign currency exposure corresponds to the net


-----

amount of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial instruments that are exposed
to currency risks.

The Group has the objective to keep the risks from foreign currency at an acceptable level. It only
accepts the risks to the extent necessary to finance the foreign subsidiaries and to support the business
operations.

The following table shows the foreign currency exposure from financial instruments broken down by the
individual major currencies as of December 31, 2020. A reasonably possible 10% strengthening
(weakening) of the USD, CHF and RMB against all other currencies would have affected the
measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and affected equity and profit
or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest
rates, remain constant and ignores any impact of forecast sales and purchases. As the derivatives
embedded in the Notes are denominated in EURO, no foreign currency exposure relating to the
functional currency of the Group exists.

**Total effect** **173,565** **-28,809** **144,756** **14,476**

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risks result from changes in prevailing market interest rates, which can cause a change in
the fair value of fixed-rate instruments, and changes in the interest payments of variable-rate
instruments. While these risks are relevant to the financing activities of the Group (long term notes),
they are not of significant importance for the Group’s operating activities.

Borrowings issued at variable interest rates exposes the Group cash flow interest rate risks. On October
7, 2019, the Group has refinanced the existing Floating Rate Notes by issuing Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes in an amount of kEUR 175,000. These notes bear a nominal interest rate equal to the 3
month EURIBOR plus 5.250%, whereby if the 3m EURIBOR is less than zero, such rate is deemed to
be zero. Given the currrent and prospective short term interest rate environment, the Group did not
enter into new interest rate swaps during the reporting period. The existing floating-to-fixed interest rate
swap, which mitigated to a large extent the cash flow interest rate risks under the former variable interest
rate financing agreements matured on June 15, 2019.

The following table shows the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments
and the exposure to the interest rate risk:

**Nominal amount**

**kEUR** **Dec. 31, 2020** **Dec. 31, 2019**

**Fixed-rate instruments**
Financial liabilities -485,981 -476,205
**-485,981** **-476,205**

**Variable-rate instruments**
Financial liabilties -185,000 -175,000
Effect of interest rate swaps 0 0
**-185,000** **-175,000**

The following sensitivity analysis shows the reasonably possible effects of a 1% increase or decline in
interest rates on the consolidated result after tax for the financial year 2020, while holding all other
variables (in particular foreign currency exchange rates) constant:

**kEUR** **31.12.2020** **31.12.2019**

1% increase in interest rates -7,523 -3,054
1% decrease in interest rates 4,287 -1,056

**Credit risk**

A default risk of financial instruments arises if counterparties are not able to meet their payment
obligations, or are not able to meet these obligations in full. Cash and cash equivalents are only held
with selected banks and thus with contract partners which is rated at least BBB by S&P or Fitch or at
least Baa2 by Moody’s in order to limit this risk.

The risk attributable to trade accounts receivable or financial receivables is defined as the risk that
outstanding receivables are not settled on time or that they are not settled at all. A credit risk
management system operating on the basis of a globally applied credit policy ensures that credit risks
are constantly monitored and bad debts minimised. This policy, which applies to both new and existing
customers, governs the allocation of credit limits and compliance with those limits, individual analyses
of customers’ creditworthiness based on both internal and external financial and macro-economic
information, risk classification, and continuous monitoring of the risk of bad debts at the local level.
Collateral received (e.g. documentary letters of credit) and other safeguards include country-specific
and customer-specific protection afforded by credit insurance, confirmed and unconfirmed letters of
credit in export business, as well as warranties and guarantees. Furthermore, in certain cases downpayments and advance payments are agreed. As soon as receivables have reached the second
dunning level, the sales department is required to make clear payment agreements with the customer.
A dunning run is carried out every week. If a receivable reaches the third dunning level, further deliveries
are suspended until payment is actually received. We also monitor our key customer relationships at
the regional and global level. In case a contract partner becomes defaulted, all financial asset with this
counterparty are impaired.

The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that CABB Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated
with its financial liabilities. The Group’s approach to manage liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible,
that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due. The Group monitors and
reports cash flow on a monthly basis.


-----

Current financial liabilities are backed by cash and cash equivalents (€52.1 million; December 31, 2019:
€29.1 million), by unutilised revolving credit facilities of €64.5 million (December 31, 2019: €75.8 million)
and a guarantee line of €5.5 million (December 31, 2019:€4.2 million).
