The amendments had no material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations: - Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020. The amendments to IFRS include an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards. Furthermore, an additional provision was added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer must apply the provisions from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when identifying assumed liabilities within the scope of these standards. - The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items produced while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognized with the associated costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not permissible. - The amendments to IAS 37 specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 to contracts existing at the date when the amendments are first applied. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments is i ----- recognized as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity, as appropriate. The comparatives are not restated. - The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and vice versa are to be included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities. Costs or fees paid to other third parties may not to be included.

Our non-IFRS measures are defined by us as follows: We define “Reported EBITDA” as net result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial results, amortization and depreciation. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as net result for the period adding back taxes on income, financial result, amortization and depreciation and adjustments for expenses and income not related to the operational performance of the business activities, such as strategic projects, restructuring and reorganization measures, financial impacts of natural disasters, property damage insurance compensations, as well as valuation impacts resulting from curtailments or modifications to pension or post-retirement benefits schemes and purchase price allocations. We define “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We define “Group Net Working Capital” as inventories plus accounts receivable, trade plus contract assets plus other non-financial receivables plus income tax receivables minus accounts payable, trade minus contract liabilities minus income tax liabilities minus other non-financial liabilities. We define “Operating Net Working Capital” as Group Net Working Capital minus purchase price allocation (“PPA”) valuation on inventory plus net working capital of holding entities plus net income tax receivables. We define “Capital Expenditure” acquisition of intangible assets plus acquisition of property, plant and equipment as stated in the cash flow statement. Total Capital Expenditure includes paid capital expenditures only. We define “Total Net Financial Debt” as the aggregate principal amount of notes, loans from non-controlling interests, accrued interests, lease liabilities, the negative fair value of interest rate swap agreements and utilized revolving credit facilities, less short-term cash deposits as well as cash and cash equivalents. We define “Cash Generation” as Adjusted EBITDA minus net cash flow from investing activities. We define “Cash Conversion” as Cash Generation divided by Adjusted EBITDA. We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating result as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to profit for the year or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Business Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) and fine chemistry manufacturer with global operations, supplying customized ingredients to major players in the Western Crop Science market, as well as high purity and high-complexity chemical ingredients to customers in the Life Science and Performance Material markets. Our strong technology portfolio, technical know-how and execution capabilities allow us to cover a wide spectrum of highly specialized customer needs, specifications and complexity profiles. Headquartered in Germany, we operate a global network with six production facilities located in Pratteln (Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland), Galena (Kansas, United States), Gersthofen (Germany), Knapsack (Germany) and Jining, Shandong Province (China). Our varied product portfolio is organized across two product groups: (i) Exclusives (tailor-made active ingredients and precursors developed for individual customers on an exclusive basis (our CDMO offering)) and Specialties (highly specialized ingredients with applications in high-margin end-markets) products and (ii) Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products (intermediate and base chemical products such as high purity monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), chloroacetyl chloride (“CAC1”) and caustic soda across a large purity spectrum with multiple end-use applications). Our products are deeply embedded into our customers’ value chains, often on a near-exclusive basis, allowing us to be aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination and to set up scalable manufacturing facilities and efficient commercial production processes. The combination of our production know-how, lengthy product development processes and contractually agreed capital expenditure contributions for some of our products typically result in high contract renewal rates and low customer churn. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of €755.5 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €162.6 million (21.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin). Between 2020 and 2022, our revenue grew at 23.9% CAGR, whereas our Adjusted EBITDA grew at 20.0% CAGR. Exclusives and Specialties contributed to 56.8% of our revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 whereas Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals accounted for 43.2% of our revenue for the same period. Our products are used for end-market applications mainly in: (i) Crop Science (e.g., herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and other livestock and crop protection products), (ii) Life Science (e.g., pharma, personal care, nutrition, fragrances and flavor applications) and (iii) Performance Materials (e.g., curatives in epoxies, polyimides, polyesters and other resin systems used for electronic components, semiconductors and for composites, fibers, films, and foams that provide heat and electrical resistance). These end-markets, in particular Crop Science, have shown resilient historical growth rates and benefit from structural mega-trends that are expected to drive further resilient growth in the near- to mid-term, such as increasing demand for food and need for increased farming yields on the one hand, and an aging population and improving living standards on the other. In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the Crop Science market, approximately 20% in the Life Science market, approximately 15% in the Performance Materials market and approximately 15% relate to others (e.g., base chemicals and industrial MCA) (measured as a percentage of revenues). Exclusives, our CDMO offering, provides tailor-made active ingredients and precursors tailored to individual customer specifications in Crop Science and are a primary contributor to our overall profitability. Based on customer-developed IP, these products require customized production lines, expansive know-how and close cooperation with our customers. We offer development and manufacturing services for proprietary products on an exclusive and confidential basis to leading players in the Crop Science market such as: BASF, Bayer, Corteva and Syngenta, and we have relationships with nearly all major players in the Western Crop Science market. 1 ----- Our Specialties offering consists of specialty ingredients that leverage our considerable manufacturing expertise to create complex chemical products that serve specific customer needs across a variety of applications in the Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials industries. Unlike Exclusives, these products can be offered to multiple customers at a time. Our offering highlights our excellent production capabilities and knowhow along with our ability to offer specialized technology process and development services which allows us to continuously provide high-quality and purity products to our customers and which we believe is a key differentiator in this field. Our Specialties products are also a strong contributor to profitability, leveraging our close client relationship and high customer “stickiness”. In particular, we offer high value-add products for fastgrowing applications in Life Science (pharma and personal care as well as nutrition) and Performance Materials markets (coatings, e.g., in electronics or other industrial applications), backed by several attractive long-term customer contracts, which offer high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Customers for our Specialties products include players such as Agilent Technologies, Bayer, Corteva, Deciem/Estee Lauder, DSM, Evonik, Merck, Novartis and Syngenta. In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, we offer intermediate and base chemical products, such as MCA, CAC1 and caustic soda, that serve as chemical building blocks for other secondary chemical processes with a variety of applications across a large number of industries and markets. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas and we operate state-of-the-art sites, allowing us to provide a full range of purity and quality for our customers. Large parts of our Advanced Intermediates supply agreements feature price formulas that allow us to partially pass on price increases in costs of certain raw materials. Furthermore, we also generate a portion of our revenue from Base Chemicals and other products such as caustic soda, that are generated as by-products from our Exclusives and Advanced Intermediates production lines.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Structurally growing end-markets and increasing outsourcing trends,"Our underlying key end-markets (Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials) are enjoying strong and resilient underlying growth, further supported by increasing outsourcing trends that are reinforcing demand for our Crop Science CDMO offering. In the financial year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated in the Crop Science and Life Science markets (estimate based on internal company assessments), the majority of which consists of our CDMO offering through our Exclusives products and to a smaller degree of contributions from our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products. As a result, growth in the underlying Crop Science and Life Science markets, specifically within CDMO products and novel advanced intermediates, represent key growth levers for our business. _Crop Science_ Our addressable CDMO Crop Science market grew by 9% to 10% CAGR between 2019 and 2022, outperforming the underlying global market for Crop Science products which grew by approximately 8% CAGR during the same period (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). Market research indicates continued growth until 2027 with respect to both our addressable CDMO Crop Science market (4% to 5% CAGR from 2022 to 2027) and the underlying global market for Crop Science products (2% CAGR) (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). For more information on the specific historical and projected growth of the addressable CDMO Crop Science and underlying global Crop Science markets, see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺General.” The growth in the underlying global Crop Science market in particular is underpinned by the following megatrends (see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺Key Drivers” for a more detailed overview) (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor): - Growing population: global population growth drives demand for food and crops; and - Decreasing arable land: arable land per capita is decreasing, requiring efficient crop protection products to increase farming yields. These market dynamics are further supported by several specific trends in the addressable CDMO Crop Science market, including (see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺Key Drivers” for a more detailed overview) (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor, Company Information): 2 ----- - Growth in CDMO outsourcing: customers prioritizing research and development, sales and marketing and digitalization activities and striving to reduce their capital intensity and costs (in 2022, approximately 40% to 50% of active ingredient production by Crop Science Players was outsourced to CDMOs); - Increasing complexity of active ingredient molecules: requires specialist CDMO partners with strong technical expertise and assets fitting into global supply chains of Crop Science players; and - Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements: lead to higher demand for novel active ingredients, often outsourced to CDMOs with highly efficient multi-purpose facilities. Furthermore, historical demand for crop protection products has proven to be resilient to adverse events maintaining a growth trend in spite of temporary downturns. For example, declines in average crop commodity prices (e.g., corn, wheat, soybean) caused by events such as lower pest pressure and economic recessions in production markets such as in Brazil, and North American weather conditions in 2019 led to a temporary downturn in the crop protection market but were followed by year-on-year increases. Furthermore, while agrochemical production was impacted by coronavirus-related restrictions in the first quarter of 2020, it swiftly normalized following an easing of lockdown restrictions. While the coronavirus restrictions did impact labor availability both in terms of production and field work, many countries deemed the agricultural sector to be of considerable importance in maintaining food security, so restrictions on movement were less severe than in most industries (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). The addressable market for novel active ingredients (active ingredients introduced after 2010), a subset of the CDMO Crop Science market, is anticipating significantly higher growth rates at a CAGR of approximately 13.7% from 2021 to 2027, owing to, among other factors, a higher outsourcing rate due to production complexity (Roland Berger Report). Against this background, we act as a key partner for our clients in this area, supporting innovators with our technical expertise and state-of-the-art production facilities. Our Crop Science product portfolio benefits from a modern set of active ingredients. We are not materially involved in the production of raw materials or finished product for glyphosate or neonicotinoids. _Life Science_ Our Specialty products benefit from the strong underlying growth rates in a number of attractive niche markets for specialized Life Science applications. In 2022, the addressable Life Science market accounted for the second largest portion of our revenue after the Crop Science market. Our products in this area consist primarily of Advanced Intermediates products as well as Specialties products. Our addressable Life Science markets grew between 2019 and 2022 and are expected to grow further, driven by structural mega-trends including a global aging population and an increasing disposable income spent on personal care, showing the strength of this segment for our future growth potential (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). For more information on trends driving Life Sciences growth (including niche markets), see “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺Key Drivers.” Individual addressable high growth sub-markets such as the oligonucleotide synthesis market (used for the production of synthetic RNA and DNA templates) increased significantly in 2021 and 2022, and forecasts are estimating future significant growth. See also “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺General⸺DCA.” While this is in part due to the market’s limited current size, it also highlights how we may be able to leverage our technical excellence to capitalize on developing demand for high-purity ingredients. For example, we are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNAbased medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022). Furthermore, DCA applications in the production of synthetic RNA and DNA templates have wider uses in the Life Sciences industry than COVID-19 applications (where mostly enzymatic synthesis is employed), so our product has only some commercial exposure to the trends driving COVID-19 vaccines and will benefit from growing end markets due to both increased investments into research and development (e.g. improvement of genomic technologies) as well as broader commercial use (e.g. “oligonucleotide therapeutics”), see “Industry and _Market Data⸺Life Science⸺DCA⸺Key Drivers” (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).

We are among the top two Western CDMO players in the Crop Science market (by Crop Science CDMO revenue as of 2021). We have a strong focus on novel active ingredients, directly competing with only a select number of other Tier 1 players that are able to serve this segment. We are wellpositioned within the top five players globally in the Crop Science market (measured by Crop Science CDMO revenue as of 2021) due to strong customer relationships, diverse and unique asset footprint and technical knowhow (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). We also have a significant presence in the Life Science market, providing customized products in segments such as novel RNA therapeutics, vitamins and supplements, and anti-aging and personal care and hold leading positions in the markets for European MCA supply, high purity DCA, as well as CAE manufacturing and cosmetic grade GA in Life Science: We are one of the largest European Life Science MCA suppliers (by production volume in Europe as of 2022). We are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNA-based medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022) (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). In cosmetic grade GA, we are globally the second largest supplier (measured by revenue as of 2022) and the only European producer with global coverage (Company assessment based on Roland Berger Report). Our customized products are highly integrated in our key customers’ value chains (sometimes protected by “key supplier” relationships for major products), and we are closely aligned in demand planning and coordination. We have flexible multi-purpose contract manufacturing plants that allow for optimized downtimes between different product campaigns and change-overs. Furthermore, we benefit from six well-invested sites across the globe offering reliability, safety and high product quality.

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.3,"Longstanding, Trusted Relationships with Diversified, Blue-Chip Customer Base","We have long-standing relationships with most of our blue-chip customers. We are a trusted partner to major players in the Crop Science market and numerous leading specialties companies in the Life Science and Performance Materials markets rely on our solutions and significant expertise for their products and applications. High customer retention rates serve as a competitive moat against new entrants: For example, in 2021 and 2022, we had an overall average customer retention rate of approximately 98% (based on existing customer revenue over total revenue for the respective year), which illustrates, together with the high rate of contract renewal and lock-in effects, the “stickiness” of our topline in Exclusives. Our average duration of business relationships with our top four customers in Crop Science exceeds 15 years in tenure (based on management estimates between 2020 and 2022) and a number of our Crop Science blue-chip relationships span more than 30 years (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). Together with the high revenue visibility that most of our longer-term contracts in Exclusives provide, our customers’ long-term commitments are supported by a track record of co-investments in production facilities through upfront capital expenditure or top-up pricing over the term of the contract. We supply a multitude of individual products to our top customers, which we believe indicates our customers’ trust in our capabilities and the quality of our varied products. In 2021 and 2022, we supplied more than 10 products for each of our top three customers. 4 ----- Our customer base in particular reflects our established position and depth of integration into their respective value chains, with the top ten customers by revenue across all markets accounting for approximately 60%, based on internal assessments, of our group-wide revenue in the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Our established customer base in our CDMO Crop Science business includes the top five Crop Science majors across all major crop systems in our key end-markets, with whom we work in close cooperation in terms of process development and planning as well as the lifecycle of the project (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). In addition, while agrochemicals are a key end-market for our products, we are diversifying into other applications such as further high-value intermediates within Advanced Intermediates, pharmaceuticals and Specialties. For our Exclusives products in particular, the close customer cooperation enables de-risked investments in growth capex for further capacity and technology expansion through customer contributions (e.g., capex co-investment or ‘takeor-pay’ commitments by customers). Over the last three years, we have established a track record of consistent project wins (at least one major 1 [st] campaign project per year), building upon our deep integration into our customers’ value chains and our reputation of reliability and ability to manage complex processes. As of March 31, 2023, we also had multiple projects in varying ramp-up phases, supporting growth of the business. The growth capex associated with these ramp-up projects mainly targets or has targeted capacity expansion for Exclusives and Specialties across our plants, and production under these projects is expected to ramp-up over the short-term.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,"Attractive CDMO business model: high visibility, de-risked growth and recurring earnings","For our Exclusives products, we have developed strategic partnerships with well-known companies, including some of the largest global agrochemicals producers, including blue chip customers in our key end-markets. Due to our high level of integration into our customers’ product development and long contract terms for most of our contracts, we have high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Our long-term contracts often provide for guaranteed volumes in the initial period, contributing to a high contract renewal rate and low customer churn for a large part of our portfolio. Because of our strong market position and customer integration, we also have high visibility into our customers’ future demand and their upcoming product launches. For example, we received customer inquiries from five top Crop Science players for 70% of all active ingredients launched or planned to be launched in the market between 2020 and 2023E (calculated as share of novel active ingredients and advanced/key intermediate launches where we were inquired) and have won projects in novel active ingredients with these players at a success rate of approximately 40% (calculated as the share of projects won if we were inquired). Moreover, our customers in the CDMO business typically contractually agree for new products to either (i) contribute a portion of the capital expenditures related to new product developments and the production line setup, with minimum contract terms providing payback of the capital expenditures incurred directly by us, or (ii) firm take-or-pay agreements with limited capital expenditures contributions upfront. We continue to invest significantly in growth projects to deliver contracted new product wins and in maintenance to safeguard asset reliability. Our disciplined selection criteria in our CDMO business are focused on superior contracts with limited investment periods for growth capex projects where we typically target EBITDA pay-back periods of approximately three years and return rates of approximately 25% IRR secured by binding customer capex or offtake commitments. While this is not achieved in all our projects, we aim to strengthen our product portfolio over time with projects that either match our key criteria or otherwise offer strategic opportunities. We are well positioned to benefit from the ramp-up of contracted growth projects in Kokkola and Pratteln with an existing agreement portfolio featuring ‘take-or-pay’ commitments.

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.5,Resilient Top-line Growth and Strong Margins with Significant Future Upside,"We have shown our ability to maintain high revenue growth and margin stability, especially within Exclusives and Specialties, driven by new product wins and strong demand in the existing portfolio, while maintaining flexibility to changing market conditions through our ability to partially pass on increasing raw material and energy costs. Most recently, we commissioned a new line of product under a ‘take-or-pay’ contract and secured a new contract in our Exclusives business. Our major project wins over the last four years reflect our consistent track-record of winning and delivering large-scale projects: 5 ----- Source: Company Information (1) Highest annual revenue achieved to date. In addition, our rationalization of our portfolio to focus on high margin and growth products (e.g., DCA, GA for skin care applications) as well as price increases in Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals have further contributed to our successful performance. We have also been able to adjust our business to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic without major impacts on our operations or financial results due to resilient demand from Crop Science and Life Science customers. Driven by our management’s commitment to support high-value products and projects, we have been able to consistently generate stable margins. As a result, our revenue increased at a CAGR of 23.9% from €492.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 to €755.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue growth in 2022 was primarily driven by strong demand in both our product groups across the portfolio supported by higher pricing effects, in particular partial pass-through of increased raw material prices and supply chain costs in our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group. Our Adjusted EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 20.0% from €112.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 to €162.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The significant growth in Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 in particular was due to an increase in pricing resulting in a higher margin for our products from customers in our Exclusives and Specialties business as well as positive pricing effects in our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.6,Backward-integrated model that enables re-use of by-products and reduction of waste,"Increasing operational efficiency is a top priority for us as it provides clear benefits. When these benefits are combined, they create a virtuous cycle by minimizing negative environmental impacts, creating cost advantages in production, driving innovation and enabling our long-term competitiveness. Production processes always result in byproducts. We aim to reuse or commercialize such byproducts wherever feasible and avoid waste wherever possible. To this end, we believe we operate a highly efficient circular economy processes and we eliminate waste by developing highly efficient processes with optimized product yields and reusing materials within production cycles. Besides the environmental and sustainability advantages, this type of closed-loop system also has tangible financial benefits, as it can reduce costs for raw materials and waste treatments. In Pratteln, we are contributing to the creation of a circular economy using a “Verbund System”. This enables highly efficient and sustainable chlorination and sulfonation reactions. Chlorine and sulfur trioxide are produced as primary raw materials and used to manufacture a variety of chlorination and sulfonation reagents. In turn, these are used to produce further downstream intermediates and active ingredients. The HCl and SO2 generated as off-gases are separated, purified and recycled, reused or resold. Finally, our production sites benefit from high supply chain resilience through backward integration of key raw materials and production processes for our Exclusives and Specialties Products (by using our Advanced Intermediates production). In particular, our main multi-purpose plant in Pratteln uses an innovative set-up that offers high efficiency production of Exclusives and Specialties products, based on backwards integration of the key raw materials of chlorine. Together with the supply of large volumes of necessary MCA from our sites in Germany, we can therefore contribute to supply resilience, as we are in control of the relevant production steps and at the same time can manage the direct commercialization of side streams generated in the production processes, which are then sold as Base Chemicals. See “⸺Production Facilities.” We benefit from close proximity to our customers’ main production sites in the Western markets and we focus on developing and 6 ----- maintaining strong logistic capabilities to enable seamless fulfillment and integration in the respective customer’s supply chain.

We have underlined our sustainability commitment by committing to seven UN sustainable development goals, signing the ‘UN Global Compact’, ‘Charta der Vielfalt’ and the ‘Responsible Care’ initiative. Our corporate programs are based on external standards and assessments, and we have set up a special team as well as an ESG management tool for implementing and monitoring our ESG measures. In 2022, we became a member of the “Together for Sustainability” initiative, a collaboration of operating chemical companies that are committed to sustainability throughout their value chains. From 2022 on, all our sites will undergo annual audits by Eco-Vadis with the latest ratings conducted in 2022. Furthermore, our holistic approach to ESG is reflected by, among other indicators, our twelve sustainability targets, which comprise seven targets by 2025 and five by 2030, respectively, and by the role of ESG performance in management bonus schemes.

On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom, the only material assets of Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. will be its equity ownership in the Issuer. References to the “Group” are to Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. On June 26, 2014, Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and the Issuer entered into the Senior Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement. The Senior Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement will be cancelled and the Senior Notes Proceeds Loan will be repaid in connection with the redemption of the Existing Senior Notes. (3) As part of the Group’s corporate strategy, Monitchem HoldCo 2 S.A. and the Issuer may in the future change their legal form into a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) and migrate their effective place of management from Luxembourg to Germany (the “Migration”). (4)  On October 7, 2019, Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. issued €150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 9.500% senior notes due 2026 (the “Existing Senior Notes”). The Existing Senior Notes are expected to be redeemed in full in connection with the Transactions. (5) On October 7, 2019, the Issuer issued €315,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.250% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2025 (the “Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes”) and €175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its senior secured floating rate notes due 2025 (the “Existing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the Existing Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes, the “Existing Senior Secured Notes” and, together with the Existing Senior Notes, the “Existing Notes”). The Existing Senior Secured Notes are expected to be redeemed in full in connection with the Transactions. The Notes will be the Issuer’s general, senior obligations and will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement (as defined herein), certain cash management obligations, if any, and certain hedging obligations, if any, and rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, if any. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the “Notes Guarantees” and each, a “Notes Guarantee”) (i) on or about the Issue Date, by CABB Group GmbH and (ii) within 120 days of the Issue Date, by the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined herein) (each a “Guarantor” and together, the “Guarantors”). The Notes Guarantee issued by each Guarantor will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including indebtedness incurred under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations) and rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, if any. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of the enforcement of the security, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral and distressed disposals only after obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and certain super-senior hedging and cash management obligations have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_ (6) On April 20, 2023, CABB Group GmbH, as borrower and guarantor and the Issuer, as guarantor, entered into the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement which provides for the €110 million New Revolving Credit Facility. We expect that the New Revolving Credit Facility will be undrawn on the Issue Date. The New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the same entities that guarantee the Notes and will be secured on a first priority basis over the same collateral securing the Notes and certain hedging and cash management obligations. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement.” (7) As of and for the financial year ended December 31, 2022, the Guarantors represented 99.5% of Adjusted EBITDA (disregarding the EBITDA of any member of the Group that generates negative EBITDA). 13 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Any change in demand or in the application of our products within these end-markets or the failure to accurately predict or adapt to future market trends may negatively impact our sales and margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Based on our internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of all our products were used in the Crop Science market in 2022 (measured as a percentage of revenues). Historically, the Crop Science market has experienced seasonal declines due to, among other things, decreasing crop commodity prices and subsequently lower net cash income for farmers, lower pest threats which negatively affects demand for pesticides, trade restrictions, inclement long-term weather conditions and economic recession in production markets such as in Brazil. While the market for Crop Science has grown each year for the past three years, any future market trends are inherently uncertain and any declines in demand for Crop Science (as well as in any other end-market) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. This industry is driven by structural long-term trends, such as population growth combined with an increasing calorie intake per capita, in particular in emerging markets, and decreasing arable land per capita. Furthermore, over the past decades, Crop Science products have become increasingly complex and newer products are required to replace old ones, driven by either regulatory requirements or the search for more effective formulations (Roland Berger Report, Company Information) and we may not be successful in offering the products required by our customers. See also “⸺Risks Related to Our Business⸺We are dependent on a small number of Customers and _Key Products for a significant portion of our revenue.”_ In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 20% of our products were used in the Life Science market (measured as a percentage of revenues). This market is affected by several long-term trends, including an aging population driving an increase in chronic diseases and leading to more spending on, and demand for, pharmaceutical and personal care products, as well as a growing middle class that is leading to an increasing sedentary lifestyle (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). However, innovations and technological progress in the pharmaceutical industry, including production processes of pharmaceutical products, as well as changes in access to medical care, changes in the ability of end-customers to pay for medical care and regulatory approval of certain medical therapies by public health authorities such as the FDA (as defined below), can affect demand for our products in the Life Science market and we may not be successful in offering the products required by our customers. Furthermore, changes in general economic conditions directly impact consumer confidence and spending as well as the general business climate and levels of business investment. This may directly affect our customers in the food, personal care and cosmetics industries and ultimately our business, 25 ----- financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. See also “⸺Risks Related to Our Business⸺We are _dependent on a small number of Customers and Key Products for a significant portion of our revenue.”_ Finally, the growth of the Performance Materials market is expected to correlate to the general economic conditions measured by GDP. In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 15% our products were used in the Performance Materials market (measured as a percentage of revenues). Declines in the electronics and semiconductors end-markets or specific industrial and infrastructure applications (e.g. hot air filtration), or other disruptions affecting these niche applications could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our Performance Materials products and therefore on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Similarly, other products, such as caustic soda, that are generated as by-products from our Exclusives and Advanced Intermediates production lines, might be affected by similar declines in their respective end-markets or changes in supply and demand balances. For example, the market price of some of our products, e.g. caustic soda, and raw materials we use in our production declined in 2020 and 2021, thereby negatively impacting the contribution of some of our products to profitability for the financial years 2020 and 2021, but subsequently significantly increased in 2022 and, in the case of caustic soda, reached an all-time high. However, the market price for some our products, including caustic soda, is expected to normalize (approximately €400-600/t (WE spot rate)) and may be exposed to future fluctuations due to macro-economic or other risks which could affect the pricing in Base Chemicals and Advanced Intermediates. Continued elevated levels of political and economic uncertainty, increased interest rates, rising inflation, price volatility and shortages in raw materials and energy, increased transportation costs and climate chaos could have unpredictable consequences and may lead to a global economic downturn, potentially affecting demand for all our products. In addition, in Europe, past and potential future changes to monetary policy, continuing doubts about the future of the Eurozone, insufficient deleveraging in the private and public sectors and an elevated level of political instability could adversely affect our operations. In the United States, uncertainties associated with policies adverse to international trade implemented in recent years (for example with China), both nationally and internationally, have led to market volatility and political uncertainty. Also, any imposition of tariffs as a result of economic or political tensions may affect, for example, costs for obtaining raw materials necessary to our business. Should such developments arise again and lead to a global economic downturn, it may reduce demand for goods that incorporate our products and, in turn, our customers’ demand for our products. All of the above could negatively impact our sales and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In late February 2022, Russian military forces launched a significant military action against Ukraine, which has resulted in sustained conflict and disruption in the region. We do not have any direct revenue exposure to Russia or Ukraine; however, we are aware that some of our customers subsequently distribute our products or incorporate our products into the production of their goods which, in certain circumstances, are distributed, and may continue to be distributed in the future, into Russia or Ukraine in reliance upon exemptions from sanctions in the crop protection and pharmaceuticals markets. To date we have not experienced any material disruption to our operations, however, the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable. This conflict has led to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in energy and other commodity prices, financial markets, supply chain disruptions and changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, as well as increases in cyberattacks and espionage. See “⸺Economic downturns or worsening global economic conditions _may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.”_ Russia’s annexation of Crimea and subsequent military action against Ukraine have led to sanctions being levied by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, including, among others, the removal of certain Russian 26 ----- financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system, which can significantly hinder the ability to transfer funds in and out of Russia. The situation is rapidly evolving as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries or jurisdictions may implement additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia or other countries, regions, officials, individuals or industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as any potential responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, has adversely affected the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “⸺Risks Relating to Legal Matters⸺We must _comply with foreign trade laws, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-trust, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws across the jurisdictions in which we operate.”_ We are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine, including the increase in energy prices associated therewith, and are assessing its impact on our business. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the conflict in Ukraine or its impacts in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus as the conflict and any resulting government reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. In addition, evolving policy dispute between China and the United States and other international communities may result in sanctions and other measures against China in the future, which may adversely impact our business. An escalation of trade tensions between the countries we operate in and China, including if China were to, or is perceived to, provide support to Russia in the war in Ukraine or to circumvent economic sanctions imposed against Russia and its allies, may result in sanctions from the United States and the other countries we operate in against China and its constituents. To the extent such sanctions are put in place, our operations in China (including operations of our joint venture in China) may be significantly restricted. Moreover, such sanctions may also potentially result in the loss of business from our top customers, suppliers, distributors and/or other counterparts if they impose restrictions on our dealings with such parties as where, for example, such parties are owned or controlled by or otherwise affiliated with one or more Chinese person or entity.

We are highly regulated and may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with, or address liabilities under, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business.","The chemical industry is subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate or do business, including requirements under governing licenses and permits with regard to air emissions (e.g. CO2 and NOx emissions reduction requirements), energy efficiency (e.g. energy usage reduction), water discharge, the use, management, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, the protection and restoration of plants, wildlife, natural resources and public health and safety, product safety and content, the investigation and remediation of contaminated land, and worker- and product-related health and safety, as well as numerous related reporting and record keeping requirements. We are required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in relation to our production and distribution processes, and the relevant regulatory authorities carry out regular inspections to ascertain our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. The demands of compliance may require us to incur substantial costs, including capital requirements, clean-up costs, fines or penalties, and/or may restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably, and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also lead to public reprimand, fines or other sanctions, loss of ability to operate and/or sell within certain jurisdictions and damage to our goodwill and reputation and could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot ensure that we will in the future be able to obtain and finance all permits which we require for our business operations. Such failure or any violation of the terms and conditions of such permits, permitting delays or revocation of existing permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also cannot ensure whether or not future administrative action, laws, regulations, international treaties or policies will ban or restrict the usage of some of our products or their respective ingredients or substances in the 27 ----- future. For example, in early 2023, the French food safety authority ANSES initiated a procedure to withdraw authorization of the main uses of plant protection products containing the active substance S-Metolachlor (SMOC), one of our products, because of groundwater pollution and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) published a restriction proposal on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that would effectively ban all forms of PFAS currently in use, apart from active ingredients in medicines, pesticides and biocidal substances. Although France’s ban on SMOC would have a limited impact on our business and although we are closely monitoring further policy measures as well as legal and administrative actions, we cannot exclude with certainty whether the European Union or other countries will adopt further restrictions on SMOC. Any ban on our products or their respective ingredients or substances or any ban on the exportation of such products could impact our operations, including the closure of production lines in our facilities where they have been specifically tailored for the production of a certain product, and/or our business partners’ value chain and could require additional costs associated with internal restructurings, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may face increased competition in the future from other potential new entrants in our markets. Competition is based on several key criteria, including technology and technological capabilities, product quality, proprietary technologies and know-how, innovation and performance, production capacity, attractive pricing, geography, security, speed of supply and responsiveness to product development in cooperation with customers. Some of our existing competitors are, and potential future competitors may be, larger than we are (e.g., by revenue or geographical coverage), may have greater financial resources and may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to better withstand changes in conditions within our industry, fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and energy and changes in general economic conditions. Additionally, competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to lower our prices or lead to loss of customers or products and, as a consequence, additional costs for investments into replacement products and/or internal restructurings, which could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability.

In subsidized markets such as the United States, Europe and certain markets in Asia, including Japan, reduction of subsidies to growers may inhibit the growth of markets for products used in agriculture. In addition, changes in governmental policies that impact agriculture may similarly inhibit the growth of markets for products used in agriculture. Specifically, government programs that create incentives for farmers (for example, the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard) may be modified or discontinued. However, it is difficult to predict accurately whether, and if so when, such changes will occur. Should such changes occur, we may experience decreased demand for our products, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We expect that the policies of governments and international organizations will continue to affect the planting choices made by growers as well as the subsidies available to growers to purchase products used in agriculture and, accordingly, the results of our operations in the agriculture industry. 28 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Governmental restrictions as well as concerns for the health of employees or confirmed infection cases in our production plants worldwide have caused in the past and may cause in the future, temporary full or partial plant shutdowns and increased costs for protective measures such as staggered schedules, cleaning costs and costs for protective equipment. Uncertainty regarding future developments remains high and there are risks of future supply chain disruptions, increased prices and unavailability of raw materials, production shutdowns, declining demand for our products or problems with shipping products internationally, that could result in higher costs of our products. Furthermore, demand for certain products may fluctuate in the future, negatively affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company has not experienced any material negative impact from COVID-19 with respect to customer demand in the Crop Science and Life Science industries or any significant cancellation of contracts or confirmed orders from our customers. However, some of our plants, such as Jayhawk in the United States, have experienced temporary full or partial shutdowns due to a rise in number of infections and our plants may experience such shutdowns in the future. The extent of the adverse impact of an infectious disease or other serious public health concern, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on the global economy and markets as well as on our business, operations and financial results is difficult to predict. Such impacts will depend on the measures taken to limit the spread and counter its impact and on the size and effectiveness of the compensating measures taken by governments, as well as how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Failure to manage the risks mentioned above and other risks related to an outbreak of an infectious disease (or a new mutation of an existing infectious disease) or other serious public health concern could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Business,13.2.1,We are dependent on a small number of Customers and Key Products for a significant portion of our revenue.,"We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from several large customers and key products and the loss of any such customer or key product would negatively impact our operations. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, based on internal assessments, our top ten customers across all markets accounted for approximately 60% of our total revenue. Our top 5 Exclusives products accounted for approximately 40% of our Exclusives and Specialties revenue in the financial year ended December 31, 2022 and our top 5 Specialties products generated approximately 15% of our Exclusives and Specialties revenue in the same period. Similarly, our top 5 Advanced Intermediates products generated approximately 60% of our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals revenue in the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Our inability to maintain our customer relationships with key customers or otherwise retain their business at current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. This applies across almost all our product groups. We may lose customers or key products because of, among other things, industry consolidation, customer dissatisfaction, competition, our customers’ products becoming obsolete, product quality and impurity concerns or customers finding cheaper alternative products. Our sales would be adversely affected if customers who currently outsource manufacturing of certain products to us decide to source such products internally or with one of our competitors. For example, one of our customers has decided not to renew a supply contract for a key product that is due to expire in 2024, which generated a mid single digit percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, since certain of our products are difficult and expensive to transport over long distances, if local or regional customers were no longer to buy such products, we may encounter difficulties in finding other customers in the same area, which could lead to a decrease in our sales. Furthermore, we supply some of our customers, particularly for our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals, without formal agreements in the open market, which results in lower switching costs for our customers and reduces our ability to predict our sales to such customers in the long-term. 29 ----- Several of our key customers require us to undergo a manufacturer certification process for new products in connection with the registration they undergo when registering a new product or formulation. This may involve an inspection by the customer’s own testing team of the product itself, focusing on quality testing, and of our manufacturing process by conducting plant audits. These manufacturer certifications are essential, because no sales to these customers can occur without such certifications. The testing is rigorous and can be time-consuming. We currently hold many certifications from key customers, but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience difficulties in retaining existing and obtaining new certifications as and when necessary. Failure to retain existing certifications or obtain new certifications may result in the loss of such customers. Any loss of, or significant reduction in demand from, one or more of our significant customers or termination of contracts with regards to any key product could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Business,13.2.2,Changes in our customers’ products or processes can reduce the demand for our products.,"Our customers use our products for a broad range of applications. Changes in our customers’ products or processes may result in our customers reducing the volume of products they outsource to us or otherwise purchase from us, or even make our products unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative chemicals or processes that no longer require our products. For example, should a customer in Crop Science, Life Science or Performance Materials decide to use a different active ingredient or intermediate due to price, performance or other considerations, we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements. In some instances, we are the key supplier to our customers with respect to selected key products. Consequently, the success of our products depends, to a significant extent, on the success of our customers’ own products in the relevant end-market. Conversely, new digitalization and technological advances could also lead to more efficient farming (through genetically modified seeds and more precise weather predictions) and our chemical products could ultimately be used more efficiently by our customers such that there is a decrease in demand. For example, genetically modified organisms could reduce or replace the need for insecticides or other Crop Science products. In addition, the improved availability and accuracy of field data could lead to more precision and efficiency in the use of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides for crop protection purposes and likewise lower the demand for our Crop Science products. Similarly, newly launched products might not reach the expected performance due to lack of sufficient demand in certain end-markets or customers decide to purchase lower volumes of our products. Any reduction in demand for herbicides, fungicides and insecticides products for which we supply advanced chemicals and active ingredients to our customers could negatively impact demand for our products. Additionally, our results of operations are influenced by the evolving nature of regulations impacting the industries in which our customers operate. We are also dependent on our customers’ continuous development of new products and their need for our production and technical expertise. If our customers were to fail to develop new products for which they outsource manufacturing to us, or if they otherwise do not require our production facilities or production facility capacity, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

This requires significant ramp-up times and costs to set-up appropriate production lines and processes. We commit to such long-term projects (under contractual frameworks) with the expectation that we will recover our initial investments in the short-term and achieve desired returns and profitability growth in the mid- to long-term. The expected returns under these long-term contracts for Exclusives products account for a certain portion of our Group’s future growth and profitability prospects and if the actual returns do not match our expectations or if the contracts are breached, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our CDMO contracts in Exclusives typically feature a minimum contractual length, as well as other mechanisms (e.g., co-investments by customers), targeting the recovery of our capital expenditure (“Capex”) for the project. We cover part of our initial Capex either through an initial investment from our clients or through contractual ‘take-or-pay’ clauses committing the clients to minimum purchase volumes and prices for an initial period. While this contribution from our clients to our costs helps integrate our services into their value chains and adds to their potential cost to switch suppliers, the custom production lines and processes developed this way are usually product specific and cannot be easily re-purposed in case a contract is terminated or otherwise 30 ----- modified. Should our customers refuse to renew existing contracts with such clauses, our profitability might be impacted. Furthermore, should a customer choose to exercise a force majeure clause, or otherwise refuse to tender payment for our services or terminate our contract, this would lead to losses or write-offs or additional costs on our part (such as increased storage and other costs). Conversely, we may be unsuccessful in exercising a force majeure clause ourselves, and as a result incur additional expenses under a contract that is no longer generating the expected returns. Furthermore, if such contracts are terminated for cause, or modified or breached by ourselves or our customers, we may not receive payment for our capital expenditures or generate the expected returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

As many of our products are critical to, or enhance the performance of, our customers’ applications and products, our customers rely on us to provide them with products that meet their specifications and quality requirements. Our quality control systems and in-process production controls provide for regular inspection of our products. However, there can be no assurance that our products will meet agreed specifications or quality requirements, will not contain impurities or be mistakenly co-mingled with other products (for example, due to mislabeling) when initially produced. In the past, prior to distribution to the customer, our controls have identified completed products which have failed to meet customer specifications. In such instances, we have been required to re-run the manufacturing process to achieve the proper specifications, which has resulted in loss of revenue due to the need to deliver replacements at our own expense, reduction in sales volume due to the loss of diverted production capacity and delayed delivery of product to customers. Our contracts with our customers require our products to meet agreed specifications or quality requirements and therefore we may face similar consequences if we fail to detect such quality deficiencies in the first instance or otherwise deliver products which do not meet these requirements. In the event our quality systems identify issues only after shipping, we could further face the possibility of a recall, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial additional work or destruction of material. Furthermore, some of our customers may ask us to manage the whole supply chain process (raw material sourcing, production and delivery) which would require increased resources and working capital, and therefore funding. If we are unable to obtain additional funding in order to finance increased working capital, we could fail to meet our customers’ demands. Any of these failures could also result in reputational harm and customers’ placing orders for lower volumes with us, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We continue to focus on efficiency improvement initiatives to optimize our asset base, increase operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. We also continue to select suitable materials to build various process equipment, estimate raw material usage ratios, production capacity and waste generation as part of our business strategy. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategies or that implementing these strategies will sustain or improve, rather than harm, our results of operations. 31 ----- In particular, we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency or asset utilization or achieve other cost savings, such as the operational efficiency measures we are currently implementing in all of our international production facilities. In addition, the costs involved in implementing our strategies may be greater than we currently anticipate. For example, we have invested more than €25 million into a new production train in our Kokkola facility in Finland and we expanded into the United States in 2019 when the Permira Funds acquired Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries, including Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation and its production facility in Galena, Kansas, United States. However, our ability to continue similar capacity expansions in our production facilities may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, the availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards, such as weather conditions and natural disasters, internal restructurings due to loss of customers or key products and other risks customarily associated with construction projects, including access to credit. See “We are dependent on a small number of Customers _and Key Products for a significant portion of our revenue.”_ Moreover, the capital expenditure that we estimate for use in such capacity expansion projects may be insufficient to cover the actual cost. We may experience cost overruns, and the cost of capacity expansion projects could have a negative impact on our financial results until capacity utilization is sufficiently high to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion. Our business strategy, in particular our production capacity expansion plans, is based on assumptions about future demand for our products and on our ability to optimize utilization of our existing and future production facilities. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our strategy of optimizing utilization of assets in accordance with our plans or at all. For example, the frequency and length of facility maintenance and turnarounds (scheduled outages of a production facility in order to perform necessary inspections, tests to comply with industry regulations and any maintenance activities that may be necessary), planned restructurings and unplanned outages have had, and may in the future have, an impact on our operating results.

We typically experience the strongest demand in the fourth quarter of the year and the first quarter of the following year in line with increased demand for Crop Science products in the Northern Hemisphere each spring prior to the growing season. Further, seasonal fluctuations including adverse weather conditions (heat, cold, heavy rain, dryness, storm and exacerbated weather conditions due to climate change) may adversely affect certain of our markets and customers. Elevated temperatures may lead to prolonged vegetation periods and multiple harvests. Mild winters and strong humidity may lead to the increased spread of fungi, viruses and harmful insects and thus crop yields may decrease and/or the use of pesticides may increase. For example, in early 2019 severe North American weather conditions led to a temporary downturn due to limited crop planting in that region and in the summer of 2020, dry weather in Europe affected some of our customers, impacting demand. Furthermore, droughts and dry weather conditions in Europe, North, Central and South America in 2022 impacted the production of, amongst others, fruits, vegetables, soybeans and maize. In addition, most chemical production companies, including certain of our suppliers and customers, generally schedule repairs of machinery and production facility turnarounds (scheduled shutdowns of production units or facilities for maintenance) in the summer months, which may result in lower sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters of a given year.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The countries in which we operate provide for various protections and rights for employees, as well as collective bargaining agreements. These protections and rights may require us to invest greater time and costs in amending employees’ terms of employment or make it more difficult to terminate employment contracts. For example, certain employees in Germany and Finland are represented by trade unions and works councils which generally must approve changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits. The employees of Jayhawk are also members of a union. Litigation by labor representatives, a labor disturbance or work stoppage at any of our facilities as a result of any changes to our employment terms and conditions or for any other reason could have a material adverse effect on that facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Our production facilities, equipment and other assets are insured for property damage and business interruption risks. However, our insurance does not cover mechanical equipment failure, and we may choose not to seek such coverage in the future due to our assessment of the cost effectiveness of entering into such policies and the possibility of mitigating such risks with spare parts or alternative sourcing options instead. We maintain liability, property, directors’ and officers’ and other insurance coverage with coverage limits we consider adequate for the size of our company and consistent with our business needs. However, we cannot be fully insured against all potential hazards incident to our business, including losses resulting from global conflicts or terrorist acts, certain natural catastrophes, environmental risks or other potential losses. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any claim under our insurance policies will be honored fully or timely, our insurance coverage will be sufficient in any respect or our insurance premiums will not increase substantially. For example, after a fire incident at our Pratteln site in 2020, affected our production output, our insurance policy premium for property damage and business interruption more than doubled. We have experienced increases driven by inflation and other macroeconomic developments and insurance premiums may significantly increase in the future as a result of accidents of ours, other companies in Industrial Parks, or our competitors (which could be considered as industry risk) or due to changing market conditions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, or if premiums for certain insurance policies might increase substantially in the future as a result of any further incidents for which we are insured or as a result of general market forces, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We have a 68 % interest in the joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical which contributes to less than 1% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. The success of joint ventures or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable, and we may not realize our anticipated objectives or benefits. Such arrangements may require significant initial expenditures as well as ongoing expenditures for modernization and expansion. Furthermore, the ability to receive dividends, royalties and other payments from joint ventures depends not only on the joint venture’s cash flows and profits, but also upon the terms of the joint venture agreement with our partner. Conflicts with joint venture partners may lead to deadlock and may result in our inability to pursue our desired strategy or exit from the joint venture on favorable terms. From time to time, we may require the approval of a joint venture partner and any delay or difficulties in obtaining such approval could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, sales or transfers of our interests in joint ventures may be subject to the written approval of the joint venture partner, rights of first offer and, in the case of our joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical, to the approval of certain Chinese regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the bankruptcy, insolvency or severe financial distress of a joint venture partner or the joint venture itself or any new regulations, international trade restrictions or enforcements to which they become subject could adversely affect the joint venture and lead to its liquidation or a sale of our joint venture interest at a loss and, as a result, could affect our reputation as well as our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Information technology systems failures, including risks associated with upgrading our systems, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by impeding our processing of transactions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting, leading to increased costs. It is possible that future technological developments could adversely affect the functionality of our computer systems and require further action, which could require us to spend substantial funds to prevent or repair computer malfunctions. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, could be damaged or interrupted by power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, including cyberattacks, events such as fires, earthquakes, or floods and/or errors by our employees. Security vulnerabilities in information technology solutions and insufficient contingency planning measures may lead to incidents that affect the entire Group. As such threats, particularly around cybersecurity, continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security, back-up systems, cybersecurity insurance and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach and/or the resulting loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, based on the EU Data and Digital Strategies, there are several initiatives pending and new laws passed aimed at establishing a single, uniform digital European market with robust cybersecurity requirements, including the Digital Services Act, the Data Act, the Directive EU 2022/2557 on the resilience of critical entities (so-called NIS2 Directive), the Cyber Resilience Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act. Overall, implementing and complying with these laws may lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our business practices in this respect. In addition, confidential information that we maintain may be subject to misappropriation, theft and deliberate or unintentional misuse by current or former employees, third-party contractors or other parties. Any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain global data privacy, data protection, localization, security and consumer-protection laws and regulations. In general, data privacy laws regulate when and how personal data of employees, customers or any other third-party may be collected, for which purposes they may be processed and/or used, for how long they may be stored and to whom and how they may be transferred. These laws and regulations are emerging and evolving 34 ----- in countries worldwide and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations in the European Union, the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and changing. For example, we are subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (“GDPR”), under which we have compliance obligations regarding the treatment (so-called processing) of personal data, including notification obligations of personal data breaches and additional requirements for sharing personal data with any recipient outside the European Economic Area. Furthermore, the GDPR inter alia requires the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the data security in general. Under the GDPR, breaches of data protection rules may result in maximum fines equal to the greater of €20 million and 4% of the annual global turnover of the group of the sanctioned company. It is possible that the GDPR and other laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us, unforeseen, or otherwise inconsistent with our practices or that we may not adequately adapt our internal policies and/or procedures to evolving regulations, any of which could result in litigation, regulatory investigations and potential legal liability, require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit access to our products and services in certain countries. As a result, our reputation and brand may be harmed, we could incur substantial costs, and we could lose both customers and revenue. Our failure to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in enforcement actions against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by affected individuals, the imposition of integrity obligations and agency oversight and damage to our reputation, any of which could harm our business. Evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the European Union, the United States and elsewhere, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve sharing of personal data.

We are exposed to transaction effects when one of our subsidiaries incurs costs or generates sales in a currency different from its functional currency. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the relative competitive position of our production facilities, as well as our ability to market our products successfully in other markets. We are exposed to currency fluctuations when we convert currencies we receive for our products into currencies required to pay our debt or currencies used to purchase raw materials, meet our fixed costs or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. 35 ----- Certain of our sales are invoiced in currencies other than the euro, namely Swiss francs, Chinese yuan and U.S. dollars, while our consolidated sales are reported in euro.

These and other financial problems that may be experienced by our customers, as well as potential financial weaknesses in our industry, may increase our risk in extending trade credit to customers. We have limited credit risk insurance, which does not extend to protect us against all potential losses to which we may be subject. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer’s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, should a customer choose to exercise a force majeure clause in their contract and refuse to tender payment for our services, this would lead to increased storage and costs on our part or even losses or write-offs.

This has resulted in expanding and increasingly complex mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on ESG topics. These developments and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions or investigations by various governmental and regulatory agencies and increased litigation risk from private parties, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any failure or perceived failure to meet our ESG commitments or targets, or loss of confidence, or inability to meet expectations with our ESG commitments on the part of customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders as it relates to our ESG initiatives could negatively impact our business relationships, and the demand for our products. These impacts could be difficult and costly to overcome, even if such concerns were based on inaccurate or misleading information. In addition, achieving our ESG initiatives may result in increased costs in our supply chain, fulfillment, and/or business operations. Standards regarding ESG initiatives could change and become more onerous for us to meet successfully. Evolving data and research could undermine or refute our current claims and beliefs that we have made in reliance on current research, which could also result in additional costs or a decrease in revenue, negative market perception and increased scrutiny that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. A variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on such ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments is increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, a company’s efforts and impacts on climate change and human rights, ethics and compliance with law and the role of a company’s board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues. In light of investors’ increased focus on ESG matters, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet society’s ESG expectations or achieve our financial goals. As part of our commitment to ESG matters, we have introduced specific, quantifiable key performance indicators. If we fail to meet the targets of these or other key performance indicators to measure our progress towards our ESG goals, we may suffer reputational damage, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 36 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We have experienced chemical spills in the past and may continue to experience such events.","The hazards and risks of disruption associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes exist in our operations and the operations of other occupants with whom we share manufacturing sites, including our suppliers. These potential risks of disruption include, but are not necessarily limited to: - unplanned production or power disruptions; - failure of mechanical, process safety and pollution control equipment; - pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures; - explosions and fires; - inclement weather and natural disasters (including earthquakes, the development of sinkholes and tornados); - construction of national highways affecting our facilities; - cyber-attacks and other external assaults on our IT-systems or digital infrastructure; - terrorist attacks; - political turmoil; - chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; - exposure to toxic chemicals; and/or - other accidents. These interruptions and hazards could also lead to a short- or long-term suspension of operations, expose employees, customers, the community and others to toxic chemicals and other hazards, contaminate the environment, damage property, result in personal injury or death, damage our reputation and adversely affect the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business operations as a whole, and result in the need for remediation, governmental enforcement, regulatory shutdowns, the imposition of government fines and penalties and claims brought by governmental entities or third parties. In addition, the occurrence of any such event could harm our ability to obtain or maintain our existing licenses or our key commercial, regulatory, and governmental relationships. For example, in the past we have experienced chemical spills and leakages in certain of our sites, including Kokkola and Pratteln. Furthermore, a part of our Pratteln site sits in an area with increased risk of landslides and sinkholes, with one such sinkhole collapse event occurring in 2018. While we have made foundation improvements to our plants as part of investments to protect against earthquakes and believe the risk to our operations is limited, unexpected natural disasters, including landslides and sinkholes, may cause significant damage or delays in our plants. Legal claims and regulatory actions could subject us to civil liability, administrative sanctions and criminal penalties, which could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability. In many jurisdictions, such as the United States, these risks are amplified by the frequency of class action lawsuits and high punitive damages awards. Furthermore, our existing environmental, health and safety compliance and management systems set-up to prevent potential risks, enable emergency responses and crisis management plans and mitigate damages may not successfully prevent or mitigate these risks. Should any of these risks materialize, our production capacity could be materially adversely affected, which could in turn negatively impact our sales and potentially lead to a loss of market share. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 37 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In the ordinary course of business, we may face unplanned production disruptions due to unforeseen events such as fires, power shortages, sabotage, accidents or natural catastrophes, resulting in significant operational disruptions, delays, costs, or liability. For example, in 2020, a fire incident at our Pratteln site led to a partial standstill of the chlorine value chain, which negatively impacted production and therefore sales of our products, negatively affecting our revenue in 2020. In addition, in February 2021, our Jayhawk facility experienced a seven-day standstill due to a severe winter storm. As a result, we incurred substantial costs and expenses due to this standstill. Some of the crucial equipment, infrastructure systems and storage systems used within our various plants (for example: incineration boilers, mixer settlers, reactors or utility infrastructure systems) may also experience damages, decreased quality in terms of functionality or restraints due to either unforeseen events or normal wear and tear. Although we possess customary insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, and, for example, we were able to claim back certain losses from the fire incident at our Pratteln site, such plans and insurance may not cover all such disasters or be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, such disruptions could impact our relationships with our clients, all of which could have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, adverse weather or other natural catastrophes such as flooding, severe storms, landslides, earthquakes or others, whether caused by climate change or natural processes of the earth, may significantly affect our production sites and cause severe disruptions and some of our production facilities worldwide may be more exposed to such risks. For example, a past geological survey conducted at our Pratteln site in Switzerland, revealed that the site is subject to seismic activity and earthquake risk. We have already explored and initiated a seismic retrofitting process which, however, is envisaged to take several years for completion. If disruptions occur, alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or it may take significant time to start production. Each of these scenarios could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. If any of our production facilities is unable to manufacture our products for an extended period of time, our sales may decline due to the disruption and we may not be able to manufacture sufficient volumes of products to meet our customers’ needs. Furthermore, our production processes and supply chains are highly integrated and any disruptions to such production processes or supply chains may negatively impact the sales of our products. For example, the fire accident at our Pratteln site in 2020 affected not only our products used in the Crop Science and Life Science industries but also, as a result of our integrated production network, our products which are used in the Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals industry. As the production of one of the key chemicals manufactured at the Pratteln site depends on monochloroacetic acid (MCA) sourced from our Knapsack and Gersthofen facilities, we lost volumes of MCA during the outage due to the reduced demand at Pratteln while production capacity was down. Furthermore, we may face work-related accidents and near-misses on part of the employees and workers in our plants. Although we believe we maintain disaster recovery plans in line with customary industry standards and possess customary insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties, such plans and insurance may not cover all such disasters or be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any inability to recover from a third-party any or all compensation related to a disruption could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, any inability to meet our customers’ needs could cause them to seek other suppliers. Furthermore, to the extent a disruption occurs at a production facility that has been operating at or near full capacity, the resulting shortage of our product could be particularly harmful because production at the facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption. Shutdowns, strikes, weather or other disruptions affecting our upstream supply chain or our utilities or logistics providers, could have a negative impact on our business.

Our ability to receive vital raw materials, to provide our products to our customers and to dispose of our waste depends on our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with third parties, 38 ----- including railroad, trucking and shipping companies. To the extent that our third-party service providers increase their rates, including to reflect higher fuel, maintenance, labor or other costs due to increased regulation, taxation or otherwise, we may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers in a timely manner or at all. In certain instances, we depend on a single or limited number of third-party service providers, including for our chlorine supply in Knapsack or certain waste disposal services across the Group. Any disruption to our third-party service providers may lead to standstills or otherwise negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products (due to a lack of, for example, raw materials and energy supply (e.g. steam)), to deliver our products to our customers or to continue our operations in the event we cannot find any alternative provider, in particular if the availability of a particular type of service provider is limited or if we depend on only one provider. Any material increases in our transport and distribution costs that we are unable to pass on to customers or any disruption to our transportation and logistical network, including waste disposal, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows. For example, transportation routes between cities in Germany and Switzerland have limited capacity and if there is no alternative container or tank wagon that can transport products to and from our sites, our customers would fail to receive their ordered products or our own production sites would fail to receive the raw materials. Inability to deliver ordered products to customers may also lead to additional unpredicted costs for storage. Some of the chemicals we transport also face transportation and loading restrictions – for example, certain of our materials are not approved by authorities for transportation by vehicular means, which further limits the number of alternative transportation means available. Furthermore, our suppliers in China have faced the risk of unexpected delivery delays as a result of China’s zero-COVID policy and may face in the future the risk of similar political measures in which the detection of a single case of COVID19 may lead to the shut-down of an entire port. See “⸺Risks Related to the Industry in which We Operate⸺The _spread of the 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has had, and the outbreak of another infectious disease or other serious public health concern around the world could have, a negative impact on economies, financial markets and business activities.”_ Future disruptions of this nature may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Conversely, if we are not able to effectively manage our capacity or there is a decline in customer demand, and, as a result, we experience underutilization of certain sites, this could lead to overcapacity and result in profit margin erosion due to the high fixed costs of our manufacturing sites. Currently, certain of our facilities are operating at high capacity. Any disruptions in the manufacturing of chemicals at these sites, including due to capacity constraints, could impact our ability to fulfill the respective customer manufacturing contracts. In addition, the volume of manufacturing for different chemicals varies across our sites, with some sites having certain focuses and specialties. Thus, if there is increased demand in a certain manufactured chemical, we may experience over-capacity at select manufacturing sites, while other sites operate at less efficient levels. In some cases, we may not be able to easily or quickly shift production between sites employing the same methodology or technology due to the specific manufacturing requirements of our customers’ customized products (including regulatory requirements). As a result, we may face significant challenges in managing our capacity. If we are unable to manage effectively or optimally our capacity in light of changing customer requirements, which can vary and shift across the quarters of the financial year, we may experience operational inefficiencies and site underutilization or need to reduce the volumes of more profitable products to manufacture contractually committed volumes of other products. Furthermore, such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation.

As such, our manufacturing processes are dependent on the availability of various raw materials, including, inter alia, acetic acid, other carboxylic acids, acetic acid anhydride, lactic acid derivatives, chlorine in sites where we do not produce it ourselves, and various solvents and catalysts. While we rely on a number of third-party suppliers to provide us with raw materials and supplies, it is possible that any of our third-party suppliers could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements, import or export restrictions, natural disasters, international supply disruptions, geopolitical issues, strikes, shortages, financial, operational or quality issues at a supplier’s facilities and other events or could be terminated in the future. Our third-party suppliers may close production sites causing supply chain problems and any decision by our suppliers to fail to deliver certain materials in part or at all may negatively impact our business. In addition, our third-party suppliers may deliver defective raw materials that fall out of the agreed specifications in which case such raw materials would be returned. For example, macroeconomic developments or other events such as the RussiaUkraine conflict may negatively impact raw material supply chains, affecting the availability of raw materials needed for our production or used by our customers. As a result of any of these factors, we may be unable to source input products from other suppliers upon short notice and/or at the required volume. Any such delay or failure of delivery by our suppliers could result in delaying our customers’ production schedule, which could result in loss of business and reputational damage. See “⸺Risks Related to the Industry in Which We _Operate⸺Economic downturns or worsening global economic conditions may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows” and “⸺The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting sanctions and measures taken against Russia have had and may have further adverse material effects on the global economy, energy supplies and prices, and may have severe adverse effects on the operations of energy- intensive sectors (e.g., heavy industry, chemical manufacturers, metallurgy, pharma, etc.).”_ In certain instances, for example where the supply of raw materials to our production site requires a specific infrastructure such as a pipeline, we may also depend on a single supplier. For example, our plants in Knapsack and Jining depend on adjacent suppliers to supply chlorine via a pipeline. Furthermore, at our Gersthofen and Pratteln sites, we rely on a single third-party supplier for salt. Any lack of availability suppliers could have detrimental effects on our production capacity at such sites. See “⸺We rely on third parties for the performance _of transportation and logistical services” and “⸺Risks Related to the Industry in Which We Operate⸺The spread of the 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has had, and the outbreak of another infectious disease or other serious public health concern around the world could have, a negative impact on economies, financial markets and business activities.”_ We have historically been able to partially pass on increases in raw materials costs to our customers when the prices for the purchase of raw materials increased, for example, through raw material price adjustment clauses in some of our agreements and corresponding price annexes. In certain instances, we also partially pass on transportation, energy and packaging costs to our customers. However, there is a risk that we will not always be able to do so in the future and any significant and/or unexpected increases in the cost of raw materials or transportation costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers (at least in part) or that lead to a significant increase of costs in business relationships based on contracts that do not contain adjustment mechanisms could have a negative impact on our financial results. Furthermore, even if we continue to pass on a portion of the cost of raw materials and transportation costs to our customers, the cost of such raw materials and/or transportation costs may increase to a significantly higher price such that customers would seek other suppliers. In addition, several of our raw materials suppliers are based in China and any changes to the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in this region will likely impact certain chemical sites, including those of our third-party suppliers. Such changes could result in increased costs of such raw materials, delay in the production of such raw materials and, in turn, could impact our supply chain and our ability to meet our own chemical product delivery timelines. See “⸺Risks Related to Our Business⸺We are exposed to risks related to conducting _operations in several different countries.” On the other hand, we may also experience challenges in managing our_ inventory due to, inter alia, customer order cancellations or inaccurate manufacturing forecasts. Any inability to manage our inventory levels could result in such inventory becoming obsolete, resulting in write-downs of certain purchased raw materials and supplies. Any change in inventories, whether an increase or decrease, affects our cash flow and other financial results. 40 ----- These challenges may become even more significant as we endeavor to expand our business, requiring additional and new raw materials. Decisions to expand capacity may be delayed due to sourcing and supply chain problems. In addition to these risks, governmental regulations, environmental laws and regulations, increasing demand for raw materials from competitors and the effects of third-party supplier consolidation may also lead to temporary or permanent shortages of raw materials. Any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate raw materials and/or supplies or significant price increase of such materials and/or supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, our energy costs recognized in cost of sales amounted to €65.6 million, or 8.7% of our revenue. Energy costs are affected by various factors, including the availability of supplies of particular sources of energy, energy prices and regulatory decisions. In particular, prices for oil, gas and electricity have been volatile in recent years, and such volatility may continue as a result of geopolitical instability, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In addition, electricity prices for industrial consumers in Germany and Switzerland are generally higher than in several neighboring countries. Any significant increase in market prices, transportation costs, grid fees or taxes (including by reduction of tax benefits) associated with the supply of energy would increase our operating costs and, thus, may negatively affect our results of operations if we are not able to pass a certain portion of the increased costs on to our customers. Any deficiencies in our contracts with our customers or our suppliers, such as a misstatement or misapplication of a price formula, any disagreement with respect to the interpretation of a price formula or other unforeseen events, such as increasing energy prices, could result in an increase in our energy costs and could result in an inability to pass on increases in energy costs to our customers. In addition, any significant disruption in our energy supply at any of our facilities as a result of outages, stoppages, supply chain issues, regulators or public authorities requesting reduction in energy consumption as a result of supply issues or other reasons, could impact our supply chain and our ability to fulfill our customer manufacturing contracts.

Our inability to maintain our existing classification registration in member states of the European Union under the REACH legislation, or comparable legislation in other countries in which we operate or do business, may affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain products.","To operate a chemical manufacturing business and to sell and distribute chemical products involves safety health and environmental risks. As part of our business, we store, handle, transport and use certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. If operational risks - such as fires, leaks, releases and explosions - materialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment or loss of production. We must comply with a broad range of regulations related to the testing, manufacturing, registration, labeling and safety analysis of our products or the products of our suppliers. In some countries, including the Member States of the European Union (particularly Finland and Germany), Switzerland, the United States and China, these types of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and we expect this trend to continue. For example, our products and raw materials produced or imported into the European Union are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analysis of the substances contained in them. The European Union Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization 41 ----- of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006), (“REACH”), imposes significant obligations on the chemicals industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of basic chemicals and more advanced chemicals. The review and update of existing registrations is expensive and time-consuming and lead to increased production costs and reduced operating margins for chemical products. We also cannot exclude with certainty that the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) may not designate some of our other products as substances of very high concern (“SVHCs”) and thereby require authorization and a strict safety evaluation for them under REACH. ECHA is also responsible to evaluate potential restrictions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFASs”) that have been proposed by the Member States. PFASs are a large class of thousands of synthetic chemicals that are used throughout society. They are increasingly detected as environmental pollutants and some are linked to negative effects on human health. PFASs have been frequently observed to contaminate groundwater, surface water and soil. A number of PFASs are already on the REACH candidate list of SVHCs, for example perfluorinated carboxylic acids (C9-14 PFCAs) and PFHxS. On January 13, 2023, a proposal prepared by the competent national authorities of, inter alia, Denmark, Germany and Sweden to restrict around 10,000 PFASs was submitted to ECHA. All PFASs in the scope of the proposal are very persistent in the environment and the national authorities estimate that around 4.4 million tonnes of PFASs would end up in the environment over the next 30 years unless action is taken. ECHA’s scientific committees are currently evaluating the proposal. The evaluation will also take into consideration the results and the input from a six-month public consultation that started on March 22, 2023. Afterwards, ECHA’s scientific committees will adopt formal opinions, based on which the European Commission and the Member States will then decide on the potential restrictions. We cannot exclude that the proposed restrictions of the use of PFASs may have a negative impact on our business activities. Moreover, under the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012 we have to apply for approval of active substances at ECHA and for product authorization before placing a biocidal product on the market. In connection with REACH or the EU Classification, Labeling and Packaging Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008) (“CLP”), some key raw materials, chemicals or substances, including our products, could be reclassified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, on users of our products, or on our employees. Furthermore, the European Directive No. 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions (“IED Directive”) sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities and includes rules aimed at reducing emissions into air, water and land, as well as preventing the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall environmental protection. Although the IED Directive and its implementation provide transitional provisions, once a new industry standard becomes binding, existing permits, which are not in compliance with such standard can become invalid. We have in the past incurred, and will in the future incur, significant cost for capital and operating expenditures to obtain and maintain necessary permits. In the European Union, the “European Green Deal”, a strategy aiming at making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, will have a considerable impact on the industry throughout all sectors, including on our business. The implementation of the “European Green Deal” involves revisions of a large number of regulations, including REACH, CLP and the IED Directive. The “European Green Deal” is still in the process of being implemented, with many bills in the legislative process, and the impact on our business cannot yet be predicted in detail. However, we will be facing a stricter regulatory framework in many respects going forward. In addition, the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) mandates that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) conduct safety evaluations for all chemicals in active commerce and determine that new chemicals and significant new uses of chemicals are not likely to present an unreasonable risk before entering the market. With respect to any facilities we operate or may operate in the United States and with respect to any products we sell or may in the future sell in the United States, classification or reclassification of one or more of our raw materials or products could affect our ability to manufacture or market our products, result in a ban on purchase or sale of our products or raw materials or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification, labelling, handling, or other requirements. Furthermore, all pesticide products sold in the United States must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), and most must be registered with the U.S. EPA and similar state agencies. Our inability to obtain or maintain such registrations, or the cancellation of any such registration of our products, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on a variety of factors, including the product(s) involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. We attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute active ingredients, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid or reduce these risks. 42 ----- In Germany, applicable environmental laws include, for example, air emissions laws (Immissionsschutzrecht), soil protection laws (Bodenschutzrecht), water protection laws (Gewässerschutzrecht), waste laws (Abfallrecht) and plant safety laws (Anlagensicherheitsrecht). In the past, we have incurred costs and expenses due to exceeding volatile organic compound (VOC) emission thresholds. We also continue to incur costs and expenses in relation to waste water disposal and certain rehabilitation measures required under applicable laws. However, such future costs and expenses are difficult to predict. These and other regulatory requirements affecting our products that have been adopted or may be adopted in the future could negatively affect the availability, marketability, transportation flexibility or disposability (including quantity of disposability) of the raw materials or products we use, result in a restriction or ban on their purchase or sale, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification labelling, handling or storage capacity requirements.

We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and non-compliant products, the handling of regulated materials included in our products, and the disposal of our products or their components (including capacity limits of disposed waste) at the end of their useful lives. We also cannot assure that we will dispose of our internal waste in a cost-effective manner. This can require significant expenditures and non-compliance may result in the limitation or suspension of manufacturing or subject us to stricter regulation, prohibition to use such substances, material monetary fines and penalties, civil or criminal sanctions, or other liabilities. In the past we have experienced several environmental incidents at our various manufacturing sites that have required certain clean-up efforts. In each case, the local sites were in contact with the respective authorities, and the matters have been closed without further action or remediation required although continuous monitoring is required in certain cases. There can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve any further issues of a similar or differing nature in the same manner or that future incidents will not require significant remediation. Contamination or residual pollution at any formerly owned or operated properties can also result in liability. In the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at third-party locations, including facilities we formerly owned or operated, the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination or residual pollution, or the imposition of other clean-up obligations for which we are responsible, we may be required to take additional, unplanned remedial measures for which we have not recorded reserves. Furthermore, environmental laws may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment, which could result in liability for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault.

We may be liable for damages, site remediation or other environmental and health-related matters.","Some of our production sites have a long history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related activities, including the processing of harmful materials and we have experienced chemical spillages and leakages in the past. Many of our production sites sit on top of contaminated soil. For example, plots of land on the Pratteln site are partially located on contaminated sites which are registered in the Swiss cantonal cadastre of polluted sites. Due to industrial use in the past, such plots of land partially contain contaminated soil, for example, low amounts (in most cases) of metolachlor, lead, cadmium, zinc, nickel and mercury. According to section 36 of Umweltschutzgesetz Basel-Landschaft (USG BL), we must examine, treat and dispose of contaminated soil in a proper way before commencing construction. We currently remain compliant with this regulation. The Jayhawk site in Kansas is subject to a Consent Agreement entered into in June 1999 between several respondents and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (“KDHE”) in which the respondents did not admit liability for the contamination of the Jayhawk plant (previously used by the former Gulf Oil Chemical Company, among others) but agreed to perform certain remedial efforts. In 2006, a “Perimeter Monitoring Program” was established to monitor the site for residual anthropogenic releases that could be related to historical facility operations and to achieve the site monitoring objectives requested by the KDHE. Compounds historically associated with the Jayhawk site include nitrates, VOCs and perchlorate. The KDHE accepted this risk-based perimeter monitoring approach with no additional investigation or remediation required at the Jayhawk site as long as the receptors (the relevant bodies of water) remain unimpacted (in accordance with appropriate regulatory standards). Most of our sites are also located on so-called “Industrial Parks”. Such Industrial Parks are operated by the respective owner of each plot of land, who provides a regular environmental soil assessment of the land to the companies located thereon (one of which is us) and who are responsible for the environmental management of the residual pollution. Our Knapsack and Gersthofen facilities are located in Industrial Parks that contain historic residual soil contamination. As such, we may incur significant additional monitoring and/or clean-up costs as a result of additional contamination discovered, additional contamination due to a natural disaster event or additional remedial obligations imposed in the future. Moreover, we may also be jointly and severally liable for environmental and health-related damages caused by one or more of our legal predecessors or related to assets acquired by us or them, regardless of fault. Such discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate soil or groundwater contamination, at our facilities could result in substantial unanticipated costs to us. In addition, operators of Industrial Parks are also responsible for its infrastructure, for example, maintenance of energy supply infrastructure (e.g., electrical lines) or retention basins for waste water, which are used by all companies located thereon. Any disruptions of an Industrial Park’s infrastructure might affect our operations. Similarly, we might be exposed to incidents at neighboring companies beyond our control at Industrial Parks which might lead to temporary interruptions of our business operations, such as, for example, outages in our steam supply or the timely implementation of a new wastewater treatment facility in Pratteln through an outsourcing solution which is required by Swiss authorities. See “⸺Risks Related _to the Industry in Which We Operate⸺We are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions. We are highly regulated and may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with, or address liabilities under, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business.”_ Should any of the above factors occur, this may result in an increase in our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Changes in the law or the price of emission allowances, or other climate related regulatory requirements, may affect our business.","At the international level, the Paris Agreement is the first agreement that includes an obligation to keep the global temperature within a specific range, namely “well below” 2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since the entry into force of this Agreement in late 2016, and with the recent increase of natural disasters, governmental efforts to tackle 44 ----- climate change have grown globally. This goes hand in hand with the adoption of climate change legislation, relating in particular to greenhouse gas emissions and energy use and consumption. Given that the actions envisaged so far by the signatory states to the Paris Agreement were considered not to be sufficient at the last Conference of the Parties in November 2022, we expect that further legislation will be adopted and existing legislation will become more stringent over the next years. In the European Union, numerous pieces of legislation will be revised in the course of the implementation of the “EU Green Deal” and the “Fit-for-55” package, which will impose additional obligations on us, in particular relating to greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency. In the European Union, regulations attempt to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to establish a mechanism for trading in carbon dioxide emission allowances. The EU Emission Trading System (“EU ETS”) imposes an EU-wide emissions cap applying to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be emitted by in-scope operations and provides for the trade with allowances for such emissions. Operators can buy allowances when they are put on the market by EU member states via auctions or on the secondary market. Certain sectors, in relation to which the EU sees a risk that operators would relocate their production site outside the EU where they obliged to buy allowances, can to a certain extent benefit from free allocation. In recent discussions to revise the EU ETS, the relevant EU institutions agreed however, that, for a number of sectors free allocation will be phased out gradually over the coming years. Instead, those sectors will be subject to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. This means that EU manufacturers will need to buy allowances for their emissions, but that importers from outside the EU will likewise need to buy carbon certificates, corresponding to the carbon price that they would have paid if they had manufactured the products in the EU. Under the currently applicable ETS, the EUwide emissions cap is lowered annually by a linear factor of 1.74% of the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU in the second trading period. In the recent discussions to revise the EU ETS, the relevant EU institutions agreed on a one-off reduction of the EU-wide quantity of allowances by 90 million in 2024 and by 27 million in 2026 respectively and on an annual reduction of the overall cap by 4.3% from 2024 to 27 and by 4.4% from 2028 to 2030. Although we have not been required to date to acquire emission allowances for our covered operations, as the amount of our emissions does not exceed the thresholds that cause the applicability of the ETS, we cannot predict with certainty whether those thresholds may be decreased and/or what applicable thresholds in the future may be. If we were required in the future to purchase emission allowances in the amount required for our production purposes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, as a result of these changes in regulation, there have been several social movements in Europe (for example the Farm to Fork Strategy) encouraging restaurants to source their ingredients from local farms or encourage consumers to eat only locally grown foods. Such trends could potentially lead to a decrease in demand for herbicides and pesticides which could ultimately adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the United States, the EPA is engaged in ongoing GHG rulemaking. In light of legislative and judicial challenges to EPA action, significant uncertainty currently exists as to how GHG regulations will in the future impact large stationary sources, including any facilities we operate or in the future may operate in the U.S., and what costs or operational changes these regulations may require. In August 2022, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which appropriates significant federal funding for renewable energy initiatives and, for the first time ever, imposes a fee on methane emissions from certain facilities. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a significant number of U.S. states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, including through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG gas cap-and-trade programs. It is difficult to predict the form for such regulation that the U.S. Congress or U.S. states may adopt in the future (e.g., a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such requirements. For example, with respect to facilities we operate or may operate in the United States, we could be required to install emissions control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer and manage our GHG emissions program, or address other regulatory obligations, which may adversely impact our operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additional future regulation of GHGs in the United States could result from future international treaty obligations, regulatory changes under the CAA or other existing legislation, or federal, state or regional adoption of GHG regulatory schemes. For example, in March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related data risks and opportunities, including financial impacts, physical and transition risks, related governance and strategy and GHG emissions, for certain public companies. We are currently assessing this rule but at this time we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the rule on our business or those of our customers. 45 ----- In Switzerland, following the rejection of a proposed revision of the CO2 Act (Bundesgesetz über die Reduktion _der CO2-Emissionen, CO2-Gesetz) in a popular referendum in June 2021, the Swiss Federal Council has_ published a new proposal for a revised CO2 Act in September 2022. However, such revision has yet to pass parliament and, potentially, a popular referendum. In the interim, the CO2 Act has been updated to align the reduction target with Switzerland’s international commitments until 2024 and extend certain emissions reduction instruments which would otherwise have expired. In particular, the Swiss emissions trading system continues to apply with the aforementioned update ensuring that emissions reduction certificates not used in 2021 can be transferred to the time period 2022 to 2024. In addition, the Swiss emissions trading system is linked to that of the EU since January 2020. An increase of prices due to reduced number of emissions allowances issued will therefore also impact Swiss participants having to acquire emission allowances. Furthermore, modifications to the Swiss emissions trading systems following those of the EU are currently being evaluated. We are currently assessing the developments around the CO2 Act and potential modifications to the Swiss emissions trading systems but at this time we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the rule on our business or those of our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may require participation from technology providers. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing. In addition, in recent years within the United States and the European Union, there has been an increase in the number of lawsuits filed by those who identify themselves as public or environmental interest groups seeking to invalidate pesticide product registrations and/or challenge the way federal or state governmental entities apply the rules and regulations governing pesticide produce use. Even though the general predicted trend is in favor of greener agrochemical products, non-environmentally friendly pesticide products associated with older registrations face the increased risk of social and legal challenges, for example, export restrictions on nonregistered products as imposed by the European Union and Switzerland. If in the future there is any unintended regulatory non-compliance by certain of our key customers, this could negatively impact our business and operations. Responding to any potential regulatory changes and meeting existing and new requirements may involve significant costs for certain customers or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice which could ultimately result in our reduced profitability.

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including our drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal and regulatory factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” as well as elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, as well as other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our New Revolving Credit Facility will mature in 2027 and the Notes will mature in 2028. See “Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of loans outstanding under the_ New Revolving Credit Facility and of the obligations under the Notes and any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required to refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our 50 ----- business obligations, activities or capital expenditures, sell assets, raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial, or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that those actions would secure sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our indebtedness. In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing conditions in the international credit and capital markets. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, we use a Securitization Program and a Factoring Program to meet some of our liquidity requirements and are subject to various covenants thereunder. If we fail to comply with these covenants, a default may occur and we may need to fund our working capital requirements from other sources. In the absence of operating results and resources sufficient to service our indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including the terms of the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and the use of proceeds from any such disposal. We may not be able to carry out certain disposals or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due.

Some reforms are already effective, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented. EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, you should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR (or any of their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have not 51 ----- transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time). In addition, the development of future alternatives to EURIBOR may result in the Floating Rate Notes performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR had not developed. The Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, the Issuer could, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, determine an appropriate successor rate, which means that interest on the Floating Rate Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate Notes issued on or about the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Floating Rate Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Floating Rate Notes. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu or on a super priority basis. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, providers of certain additional indebtedness, certain cash management obligations, if any, and certain hedging obligations, if any, the Security Agent, any receiver and certain creditor representatives are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the aggregate of the then outstanding claims under super senior indebtedness are greater than or equal to the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under super senior indebtedness have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied _pro rata in repayment of the Notes, any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank _pari passu with the Notes and certain cash management obligations, if any, and certain hedging obligations, if any, that do not rank on a super-senior basis.

The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the obligations secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which our operations are located and the availability of buyers.

In addition, the share pledges over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The Collateral is located in Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Luxembourg and the United States, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests granted in favor of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral in certain jurisdictions. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a sale of, or foreclosure on, such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

The granting of security interests (if any) in favor of a foreign security agent (acting for and on behalf of third-party beneficiaries) will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation of such security agent is valid under the law governing its appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions depending on the type of the security interests granted. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005, as amended, concerning financial collateral arrangements (the “Financial Collateral Law 2005”), a security interest which constitutes financial collateral (in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005) may be provided in favor of a person acting for and on behalf of the beneficiary of such security interest, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security interest, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security interest provided under the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Under German law, accessory security interests such as pledges over shares or bank accounts cannot be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. In this respect, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a so-called parallel debt obligation (the “Parallel Debt”) in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors toward the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations discharges the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt discharges the corresponding Principal Obligations, in each case, by the amount of such payment. Certain of the Security Documents will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. In Germany there is no statutory or case law available on the validity or enforceability of the parallel debt construct or the security provided for such parallel debt. To the extent the Parallel Debt construct would be successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive any proceeds from the enforcement of the security interests in the relevant Collateral.

We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the obligations on the Notes through a combination of dividends and interest payments on intercompany loans. The obligations under intercompany loans will be junior obligations and will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior and senior subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer, including obligations under, or guarantees of obligations under, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flow of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to issue dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict, and in some cases, may actually prevent the ability of the subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Such restrictions include those created by the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, which limit payments of principal on the Notes prior to their stated maturity. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— New Revolving Credit_ Facilities Agreement” and “—Intercreditor Agreement.” Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that, even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In addition, the Issuer and the other Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest and the Indenture will provide that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under German, Luxembourg, Finnish, Swiss, United States or other applicable law or without resulting in a breach of any applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes Guarantee or Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the debtor-in-possession, bankruptcy receiver or trustee, in case of bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy), and a court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Notes Guarantees or the security interests granted under the Security Documents see “Certain Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”) and, if_ payment had already been made under a Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found, inter alia, that: 58 ----- - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; - the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; - under Luxembourg law, the Notes Guarantees (if any) or the security interest (if any) under a Security Document would be granted with the intention to defraud the creditors of, and prejudice their means of recovery against, the Guarantor, and where the recipient or beneficiary and the Guarantor were aware or should have been aware at the time of granting the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interests that such grant would prejudice the means of recovery of one or more (present or future) creditors of the Guarantor, unless the act was entered into without any consideration, in which case knowledge by the counterparty is not necessary for a challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interests and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or - the relevant Notes Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or security provider.

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdictions’ law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. A summary description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, the United States and certain jurisdictions where the providers of collateral are organized or have their center of main activities are set out in “Certain _Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes, upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control under the Indenture will be deemed not to be a change of control if a specified consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded immediately prior to and after giving pro forma effect to such event. Except as described under “Description of _the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to_ repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Following the Issue Date, we expect the directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuer and the non-U.S. Guarantors to be non-residents of the United States and substantially all of their assets will be located outside the United States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the non-U.S. Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The OECD published its final reports in relation to its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) on October 5, 2015, which were endorsed at the G20 summit in November 2015, and the multilateral instrument to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS was published on November 24, 2016. As part of this commitment, an Action Plan has been developed to address BEPS with the aim of securing tax revenue by realigning taxation with economic activities and value creation by creating a single set of consensus based international tax rules. As part of the BEPS project, new rules dealing with the operation of double tax treaties, the definition of permanent establishments, interest deductibility and the taxation of hybrid instruments and hybrid entities have already been introduced and will continue to be introduced in relevant tax legislation of participating OECD countries. Depending on if and how these proposals are implemented, they may result in material changes to tax laws which can impact the tax treatment of income and gains arising at the level of the Issuer, intermediate companies and portfolio companies, which may adversely impact how the returns to investors are taxed Such implementation may also give rise to additional reporting and disclosure obligations for the Issuer, intermediate companies, and investors.

For all countries which ratify the MLI after Luxembourg, its dates of application should be calculated on an individual basis.

In addition, the EU released on December 22, 2021 a directive proposal which aims to fight against the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes and ensure that EU entities with no or minimal economic activity are unable to benefit from certain tax advantages (the so-called ATAD III). These new rules would mainly apply to EU entities (i) deriving passive income, (ii) engaged in cross-border transactions and (iii) which outsourced the administration of day-to-day operations and the decision-making on significant functions. EU entities that meet these three conditions would need to declare in their annual tax returns whether they meet indicators of minimum substance and provide related documentary evidence.

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Business Overview,17.1.1,,"We are a leading CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) and fine chemistry manufacturer with global operations, supplying customized ingredients to major players in the Western Crop Science market, as well as high purity and high-complexity chemical ingredients to customers in the Life Science and Performance Material markets. Our strong technology portfolio, technical know-how and execution capabilities allow us to cover a wide spectrum of highly specialized customer needs, specifications and complexity profiles. Headquartered in Germany, we operate a global network with six production facilities located in Pratteln (Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland), Galena (Kansas, United States), Gersthofen (Germany), Knapsack (Germany) and Jining, Shandong Province (China). Our varied product portfolio is organized across two product groups: (i) Exclusives (tailor-made active ingredients and precursors developed for individual customers on an exclusive basis (our CDMO offering)) and Specialties (highly specialized ingredients with applications in high-margin end-markets) products and (ii) Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products (intermediate and base chemical products such as high purity monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), chloroacetyl chloride (“CAC1”) and caustic soda across a large purity spectrum with multiple end-use applications). Our products are deeply embedded into our customers’ value chains, often on a near-exclusive basis, allowing us to be aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination and to set up scalable manufacturing facilities and efficient commercial production processes. The combination of our production know-how, lengthy product development processes and contractually agreed capital expenditure contributions for some of our products typically result in high contract renewal rates and low customer churn. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of €755.5 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €162.6 million (21.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin). Between 2020 and 2022, our revenue grew at 23.9% CAGR, whereas our Adjusted EBITDA grew at 20.0% CAGR. Exclusives and Specialties contributed to 56.8% of our revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 whereas Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals accounted for 43.2% of our revenue for the same period. Our products are used for end-market applications mainly in: (i) Crop Science (e.g., herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and other livestock and crop protection products), (ii) Life Science (e.g., pharma, personal care, nutrition, fragrances and flavor applications) and (iii) Performance Materials (e.g., curatives in epoxies, polyimides, polyesters and other resin systems used for electronic components, semiconductors and for composites, fibers, films, and foams that provide heat and electrical resistance). These end-markets, in particular Crop Science, have shown resilient historical growth rates and benefit from structural mega-trends that are expected to drive further resilient growth in the near- to mid-term, such as increasing demand for food and need for increased farming yields on the one hand, and an aging population and improving living standards on the other. In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the Crop Science market, approximately 20% in the Life Science market, approximately 15% in the Performance Materials market and approximately 15% relate to others (e.g., base chemicals and industrial MCA) (measured as a percentage of revenues). 67 ----- Exclusives, our CDMO offering, provides tailor-made active ingredients and precursors tailored to individual customer specifications in Crop Science and are a primary contributor to our overall profitability. Based on customer-developed IP, these products require customized production lines, expansive know-how and close cooperation with our customers. We offer development and manufacturing services for proprietary products on an exclusive and confidential basis to leading players in the Crop Science market such as: BASF, Bayer, Corteva and Syngenta, and we have relationships with nearly all major players in the Western Crop Science market. Our Specialties offering consists of specialty ingredients that leverage our considerable manufacturing expertise to create complex chemical products that serve specific customer needs across a variety of applications in the Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials industries. Unlike Exclusives, these products can be offered to multiple customers at a time. Our offering highlights our excellent production capabilities and knowhow along with our ability to offer specialized technology process and development services which allows us to continuously provide high-quality and purity products to our customers and which we believe is a key differentiator in this field. Our Specialties products are also a strong contributor to profitability, leveraging our close client relationship and high customer “stickiness”. In particular, we offer high value-add products for fastgrowing applications in Life Science (pharma and personal care as well as nutrition) and Performance Materials markets (coatings, e.g., in electronics or other industrial applications), backed by several attractive long-term customer contracts, which offer high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Customers for our Specialties products include players such as Agilent Technologies, Bayer, Corteva, Deciem/Estee Lauder, DSM, Evonik, Merck, Novartis and Syngenta. In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, we offer intermediate and base chemical products, such as MCA, CAC1 and caustic soda, that serve as chemical building blocks for other secondary chemical processes with a variety of applications across a large number of industries and markets. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas and we operate state-of-the-art sites, allowing us to provide a full range of purity and quality for our customers. Large parts of our Advanced Intermediates supply agreements feature price formulas that allow us to partially pass on price increases in costs of certain raw materials. Furthermore, we also generate a portion of our revenue from Base Chemicals and other products such as caustic soda, that are generated as by-products from our Exclusives and Advanced Intermediates production lines.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.1,"Development of mega-trends in the Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials markets","_Crop Science market_ In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the Crop Science market (measured as a percentage of revenues). Accordingly, with our focus on the Crop Science market, our results of operations are affected by changes in the market environment and the demand for our products by our customers. In particular, the underlying global Crop Science market growth is driven by megatrends such as a growing population driving demand for food and crops and decreasing arable land per capita, requiring efficient crop protection products to increase farming yields. Our results are also affected by trends in the addressable CDMO Crop Science market such as a growth in CDMO outsourcing and increasing complexity of active ingredient molecules requiring specialist CDMO partners with strong technical expertise and assets fitting into global supply chains of Crop Science players (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). From 2019 to 2022, the underlying global Crop Science market grew at a CAGR of 7.8% from €55.6 billion to €69.6 billion due to trends such as favorable weather conditions, increased crop prices as well as increased manufacturing and logistics costs partially passed through with the product price (Roland Berger Report). See “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺General⸺Key Drivers.” Herbicides, fungicides and insecticides, for which we supply tailor-made products, as well as high-quality intermediates, to our customers, play an essential role in crop protection and result in higher productivity per acre (higher crop yields). In 2022, herbicides, the largest sub-segment of the underlying global Crop Science market, accounted for approximately 40%. Insecticides accounted for approximately 30%, fungicides for approximately 28% and others (e.g. plant growth regulators) approximately 3% of the market. The majority of the different segments are expected to grow with a CAGR between 2% and 3% until 2027, with the exception of herbicides, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of less than 1% between 2022 and 2027. Overall, the global Crop Science market growth is expected at a CAGR of 2% between 2022 and 2027 (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). 68 ----- _Life Science market_ In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 20% of our products were used in the Life Science market (measured as a percentage of revenues). We have considerable manufacturing power for chemical products aimed for the Life Science market. However, our results of operations are affected by macroeconomic changes in the Life Science market and the ultimate demand for our customers’ products. See “Risk _Factors⸺Risks Related to the Industry in Which we Operate⸺Economic downturns or worsening global economic conditions may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows”_ and “⸺Changes in our customers’ products or processes can reduce the demand for our products.” Markets for Life Science products served by us showed varying growth rates between 2019 and 2022. Our targeted Life Science market segments also include several fast-growing niche products such as DCA, which significantly increased in size during the same period. The addressable Life Science market growth is driven by supportive developments in specific segments with a high demand for specialty products, such as novel RNA therapeutics, vitamins and supplements, as well as a rising adoption in skin care products. In addition, the Life Science market is further positively impacted by certain mega-trends such as a global aging population, together with an increasing disposable income spent on health and personal care. Our customers include some of the largest established market brands in the cosmetics (including anti-aging products), vitamin and supplements industries. Our top products comprise Monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), Dichloroacetic acid (“DCA”), Glycolic acid (“GA”) and Ethyl-2chloroacetoacetate (“CAE”), each with several high-value applications across the Life Science market. In personal care, our high purity MCA acts as basis for Betaine synthesis used, e.g., for shampoos, toothpaste or synthetic caffeine. In addition, we are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNA-based medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022). In cosmetic grade GA, we are globally the second largest supplier (measured by revenue as of 2022) and the only European producer with global coverage. In the vitamins market, CAE produced in our plants is used as the basis for Vitamin B6 synthesis that are further applied in, for example, nutrition (Company assessment based on the Roland Berger Report). See “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺General.” _Performance Materials market_ Alongside our operations in the Crop Science and Life Science markets, our results of operations are also driven by changes in the global Performance Materials market and the demand for our products by our customers. In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 15% of our products were used in the Performance Materials market (measured as a percentage of revenues). High Performance Materials are increasingly needed by suppliers to manufacture their complex products, with our chemicals being used in, among others, flexible printed circuitry and foldable displays for smart devices, composite components for automotive and aviation, thermal insulation for aircraft and marine vessels, coatings and tubing for medical devices and radiation shielding for spacecraft.

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.2,"Volume, product mix and pricing","Individual product volumes and margins as well as our product mix are key drivers to maintaining and enhancing our profitability. We hold strong market positions across certain of our product groups in the Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials markets. We believe that we are among the top two Western CDMO players in the Crop Science market (by Crop Science CDMO revenue as of 2021). The active ingredients and precursors that we supply to our Crop Science customers are used in the production of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. Demand for these products and therefore the volumes that we sell may vary from year to year based on, amongst others, external factors such as weather conditions in different parts of the world and prevailing crop prices, which in turn can impact our margins. Our key Crop Science customers are active on a global scale and our sales to them are oftentimes based on longer-term contracts. Moreover, being a specialized CDMO is a service business, most of our Exclusives products are tailored to an individual customer’s specific requirements based on their intellectual property and, therefore, critical to the production or performance of our customers’ products. In addition, our portfolio comprises innovative products in niche markets with high growth rates, such as DCA (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). We are one of the largest European Life Science MCA suppliers (by production volume in Europe as of 2022). We are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNA-based medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022) (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). See also 69 ----- “⸺Development of mega-trends in the Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials Markets” and “Industry and Market Data.” We benefit from the critical nature of certain of our Exclusive and Specialties ingredients to the performance of our customers’ products as well as our high integration into our customers’ value chain, sometimes being the primary supplier of certain key products, which is in such cases embedded into our contractual agreements with our customers. For our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals group, which comprises a number of products, each with a broad range of customers, our business operations are mostly driven by underlying supply and demand market dynamics as well as our plant utilization rates. MCA, as one of our main products in Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals, is mainly used in the Life Science and the Crop Science markets. Historically, demand for MCA has grown across various end-markets, which, we believe, has contributed to our high utilization rates. Furthermore, proximity to customers and supply chain expertise are critical due to the relatively high transportation costs of distributing MCA. We believe we are also able to better serve our customers in this area due to our differentiated logistics capabilities. Our Base Products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA, and are used in several end-markets including the broader chemicals space, pulp and paper, alumina, soap, detergents and others. Caustic soda prices are highly volatile due to their strong dependency on chlorine production (which impacts caustic supply, as caustic demand remains relatively stable over time) and energy prices. The market price for caustic soda declined in 2020 and 2021 driven by lower overall economic activity during the pandemic, thereby negatively impacting the contribution of some of our products to our profitability for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, however it subsequently significantly increased in 2022 with prices reaching an all-time high, which had a positive impact on our results which materialized in a significant uplift of revenues in 2022. Since then, the market price of caustic soda has declined to some extent and we expect it to normalize (at approximately €400-600/t, based on Western European spot rates) further in the future (Roland Berger Report, Company Information).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.3,Raw materials and energy costs,"Raw material and energy prices are key components of our cost of sales and therefore are a significant value lever for our gross profit. Our cost of raw materials and supplies was €270.7 million or 47.9% of our cost of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: €216.5 million or 47.0% of our cost of sales; 2020: €157.6 million or 40.4% of our cost of sales). The cost of raw materials has generally been correlated with industry wide supply, demand dynamics and global economic conditions. For example, a primary driver for the increase in 2021 and 2022 was due to an increase in certain raw materials prices such as acetic acid. We have a value-added pricing model with partial cost passthrough mechanisms in some of our contracts. Since price volatilities in raw material or energy prices could have a negative impact on our margins, we are highly focused on our ability to partially pass on raw material price changes and our ability to maintain high degree of utilization in our plants. In the Crop Science market in particular, raw materials used in the production of our Exclusives and Specialties products are to a significant extent either provided by our customers and are therefore not recorded in our cost of sales, or some of our customer contracts include partial pass-through clauses to protect against fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, helping to protect against margin fluctuations. For example, in Exclusives, some contracts are conversion fee model based and resulting revenues from most of such contracts were not exposed to any raw material price fluctuations. In such contracts, raw materials are sourced directly through the customers or 100% charged at cost at the end of the production run. For Specialties and Advanced Intermediates products, some of our contracts include partial cost pass-throughs. These partial pass-through provisions help to limit fluctuations in our cost of sales and therefore protecting profitability by allowing us to partially pass on raw material price increases to our customers. For the Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals, our most important raw materials are acetic acid, acetic anhydride and chlorine and certain customer contracts by sales include price formulas that allow for a partial pass-through of price variations (not including chlorine price variations). Alongside raw material costs, our cost of sales also include energy costs, which amounted to €65.6 million or 11.6% of our cost of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (2021: €41.3 million or 9.0%; 2020: €35.1 million or 9.0% of our cost of sales). Operating our state-of-the-art technologies requires a significant amount of energy. Rising energy prices, energy price fluctuations as well as environmental levies or government incentives have had, and may continue to have, an impact on our margins. We therefore hedge against some of these price 70 ----- volatilities, in particular for our sites in Germany and Switzerland. For the financial years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, approximately 83%, 80% and 69%, respectively, of our electricity costs have been hedged and for the financial year ended December 31, 2023, we have hedged approximately 70% of our electricity costs (measured as a percentage of total GWh).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.4,Capital Expenditures and Capacity Expansion,"Our capital expenditures (capex) focus on (a) targeted capacity expansions for new and existing products and debottlenecking projects in line with the specific customer demands (“Growth Capex”), (b) maintenance projects to continuously upgrade and optimize our facilities and increase asset reliability levels as well as adopting our facilities to the required regulatory and safety standards (“Maintenance Capex”), and (c) targeted plant upgrades programs (including our “Fit for Future” (F4F) capex program to upgrade Pratteln assets, which is expected to finish this year). Our cash capital expenditure for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 was €71.6 million (2021: €68.6 million; 2020: €60.0 million). For the financial year ended December 31, 2023 we expect capital expenditures to be in the mid-€60 million range. Our capex allocation follows a stringent prioritization process managed by our Executive Committee and board to review all projects regarding financial return, e.g., payback periods and return rates (predominantly Growth Capex), binding customer commitments as well as implications on asset availability and safety prior to approval. For Maintenance Capex, we focus on our capex allocation primarily on production lines with high margin potential and/or strong customer demand and efficiency projects, e.g., improvements of energy efficiency, to ensure adequate return rates from investments. For Growth Capex projects, we typically target EBITDA pay-back periods of approximately three years and return rates of approximately 25% internal rate of return secured by binding customer commitments, with customers signing either firm commitments for minimum volumes and/or contributing a share of the capex via a fixed facility fee. While this is not achieved in all our projects, we aim to strengthen our product portfolio over time with projects that either match our key criteria above or otherwise offer strategic opportunities. _Growth Capex_ Growth Capex accounted for slightly more than a third of our yearly capex spend and increased as a proportion of total capex from 2020 to 2021 as a result of additional capacity expansion projects for new products in Finland and Switzerland and has remained relatively constant as a proportion of total capex across 2021 and 2022. Growth investments are mostly focused on high-margin Crop Science products and Life Science. We partner with most of our CDMO customers through long-term contracts to deliver specialized active ingredients and precursors according to individualized requests, often requiring custom production lines and processes. As a result, a large share of our capex is invested in our CDMO business or in contracted capacity expansion for our Specialties products. A CDMO project development lifecycle of a new product can extend to up to 18 months in the customer request phase as well as a further 24 months of investment period before commercialization. As a result, we aim to have our customers take a share in the initial capex spend by entering into agreements with our clients to de-risk the investments, with our long-term contracts for a large part of our portfolio, most of which featuring either guaranteed volumes commitments for an initial period, up-front contributions to the capex requirements to set-up production or ‘take-or-pay’ clauses. In general, we aim to recover our capex investment within approximately three years from the start of commercialization and a typical production horizon for large, strategic products extends historically to over 10 years. Increasing our ability to onboard client projects, in 2019 we expanded our operations into the United States with the acquisition of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries, including the Jayhawk facility in Galena, Kansas, United States. Furthermore, as part of our capacity expansions at our multipurpose plants, we further expanded our production capacities in Kokkola (Finland) to serve our customers in connection with already secured and newly developed products for the Crop Science market. _Maintenance Capex_ Overall, Maintenance Capex remained relatively constant as a proportion of total capex across 2020 and 2021, increasing in 2022, in line with our growing asset base. We allocate ongoing Maintenance Capex to support differentiation and competitiveness of our existing plants. Our Maintenance Capex requirement is mainly driven by the corrosive nature of substances used in our production 71 ----- process, making periodical inspection and maintenance of our plants and production chains necessary. Furthermore, our Maintenance Capex helps to ensure asset availability, productivity, energy efficiency and optimized performance. A significant proportion of yearly Maintenance Capex is allocated to maintenance works for our production plants with Pratteln (as our largest site), accounting for a large share of yearly Maintenance Capex expenses. _F4F capex_ In 2018, we began the “Fit for Future” (“F4F”) capex program for our site in Pratteln. The project, which is expected to finish this year, covers key aspects of our operations and comprises multiple initiatives to further improve and safeguard asset safety, reliability, availability and compliance. Our F4F investment projects offer returns via opportunities for price increases as well as additional volumes from the respective production lines.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We typically experience an increase in production levels in the first and fourth quarters of the year in order to meet the stronger demand in those quarters in line with increased demand for Crop Science products in the Northern Hemisphere each spring prior to the growing season. In addition, we and other chemical companies, including certain suppliers and customers, generally schedule repairs of machinery and facility turnarounds (scheduled shutdowns of production units or facilities for maintenance) in the summer months, which may result in lower sales in the second and third quarters relative to the first and fourth quarters of a given year. To the extent possible, we try to coordinate such repair schedules with our customers and suppliers. Seasonal fluctuations including adverse weather conditions may adversely affect certain of our markets and customers, thereby impacting our quarterly results disproportionately due to the seasonal nature of our business. For example, in the 2020 summer, the dry weather in Europe affected some of our customers and therefore impacted demand.

Furthermore, we were able to maintain well-managed supply chains and ensure reliable production and delivery channels to customers. While we have experienced some delays in raw material deliveries and were required to adapt our processes in procurement, inventory management and trade working capital strategies, the COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply chain and transportation network disruptions did not have a material impact on our results of operations in 2020, 2021 and 2022, underlying the resilience of the business model. COVID-19-related restrictions impacted Crop Science production in the first quarter of the financial year 2020 but normalized following the easing of lockdown restrictions. Whilst the COVID-19 restrictions did impact labor availability, both in terms of production and field work, many countries deemed the agricultural sector to be of considerable importance in order to maintain food security, therefore, restrictions on movement were less stringent than in other industries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Fixed costs include plant related and overhead costs such as personnel expenses, energy costs, repair and maintenance expenses, which are largely independent from production volumes. We operate our facilities at generally high utilization rates and continuously focus on further improving these utilization rates. To maintain the efficiency of our assets, we regularly undergo scheduled maintenance shutdowns in order to carry out required maintenance activities, perform necessary inspections and tests or accommodate for shutdowns of key suppliers. We refer to these scheduled outages as “turnarounds”. The number and length of such turnarounds carried out in any given period impact our operating results and the level of our capital expenditures. 72 ----- However, we try to coordinate such repair schedules with our customers and suppliers as they may also need to undergo “turnarounds” at the same time. Furthermore, for our multi-purpose plants that produce customized and specialized chemicals, whenever we change production from one product to another, we factor in the ‘switchover’ times required to clean the reactor vessels. This requires us to shut down operations of a production unit within a production facility until the cleaning is completed. See “⸺Seasonality.” Our production facilities undergo regular maintenance which requires the outage of a production unit or the entire facility for a period of two to four weeks per year. Repair and maintenance costs in connection with such regular maintenance can be up to several millions. In the past three years, our repair and maintenance expenses amounted to €27.5 million in 2022 (2021: €21.4 million; 2020: €20.8 million).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In particular for our Exclusives and Specialties product group, certain customers produce pharmaceuticals subject to evolving requirements, or complex Crop Science products subject to developing rules around permitted usage. Such requirements have become increasingly extensive and complex, requiring specialist CDMO partners with strong technical expertise and assets fitting into global supply chains of Crop Science players. As a result of these changing requirements, we have taken a strategic decision in the past to phase out certain services and products with lower margin to focus on our core strengths and expertise in Crop Science, which offers us a more attractive business case and return on investment. Such strategic portfolio management decisions have temporarily negatively affected our revenue for the respective years but have freed up capacities and avoided cost increases for the expansion in our core business.

Control is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them. We primarily generate income from the sale of goods. For the Exclusives and Specialties product group, revenue from specific customer contracts is recognized over time. In these cases our performance obligation consists in the creation of an asset without an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for the performance obligation completed to date. These contractually enforceable rights are recognized and disclosed within ‘Accounts receivable, trade’ if already shipped, or otherwise within ‘Contract assets’. Certain customer contracts for the Exclusives product group foresee non-refundable up-front capital expenditure fees, which are paid by the customer at the beginning of the investment project. These advance payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in proportion to the performance used by the customer during the contract period (output method). The outstanding performance obligation is disclosed in the balance sheet at each reporting date. If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognized at a specific point in time. Determination of the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the goods occurs in the context of an overall assessment of the circumstances which considers the existence of a present claim to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer of risks and rewards takes into account the underlying terms of delivery (especially the International Commercial Terms, or “Incoterms”) and is of particular practical significance. According to these principles, sales revenue from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery. 73 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The strong revenue growth was both driven by higher volumes and by positive pricing effects, as increased raw material prices were partially passed on to our customers. Revenue of Specialties increased, driven by positive pricing effects and a continued strong demand for high-value products in regulated markets, such as pharmaceutical, personal care, food and animal feed as well as automotive, aerospace and agrochemical industries. In 2020, a fire incident at our Pratteln site led to a partial standstill of the chlorine value chain, which negatively impacted our revenues in both product groups. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a temporary decline in the price for caustic soda, resulting in temporarily lower 2020 revenues. Adjusted for the impact of the Pratteln site fire incident, all our product groups still experienced strong growth: in our Exclusives and Specialties product group the strong growth of 17.6% resulted from project wins and strong demand for our existing portfolio of products, growth in innovative niche specialties products and overall very resilient demand in Crop and Life sciences, while Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals exhibited a 23.1% year-on-year growth in revenue which was principally due to the start of the caustic soda price recovery, continued successful partial pass-through of a certain portion of raw material price increases to customers and a largely stable volume development and, for some Specialties and Advanced Intermediates, the need for Western suppliers to de-risk supply chains. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by €70.8 million, or 18.1%, from €390.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 to €461.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.

Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a performance indicator recognized under IFRS. The EBITDA and the Adjusted EBITDA reported is not necessarily comparable to the performance figures published by other companies as EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA or the like. Adjusted EBITDA increased by €34.8 million, or 27.2%, from €127.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 to €162.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Historical growth in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by favorable market conditions and a continued strong demand across both product groups in 2022, in particular due to an increase in pricing resulting in a higher margin for our products from customers in our Exclusives and Specialties business as well as positive pricing effects in our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals business. Adjusted EBITDA increased by €14.9 million, or 13.2%, from €112.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 to €127.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The growth in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by resilient top-line growth and new product introductions, paired with shift to higher margin Exclusives and Specialties business, our ability to partially pass on raw material prices efficiently and substantial benefits from operating leverage as we focus on efficient plant and overhead management. The strong growth in Adjusted EBITDA was achieved despite supply chain disruptions in early 2021. In the first half of the financial year 2021, the Group’s performance was negatively affected by extreme winter weather conditions in the Gulf coast area in the U.S., impacting the business operations of our raw material suppliers. These suppliers were forced to declare the occurrence of a force majeure event for various products such as, for example, Acetic Acid. This resulted in a loss of already contracted business (purchase orders), which was not compensated by insurance and was normalized as part of non-recurring items. 83 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The increase was principally due to higher investments in property, plant and equipment in 2021, in particular at the sites in Pratteln and in Kokkola.

Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test at on the basis of cashgenerating units a minimum by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. 87 ----- The goodwill impairment test is performed on the basis of cash-generating units (CGUs) by comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying amount. Consistent with the internal management and reporting structure, the following three cash generating units have been identified: (i) CDMO – Europe, (ii) CDMO – North America, (iii) Non - CDMO. The CGUs reflect the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The existing goodwill was allocated to the CGUs in accordance with the purchase price allocation in 2014 for the CGU CDMO – Europe and the CGU Non – CDMO resp. 2019 for the CGU CDMO – North America. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is calculated based on the fair value less costs to sell approach. The underlying cash flow projections are based on past experiences, current results and on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. Market assumptions, such as the development of the overall economy and the market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific information sources. The required discounting of cash flows for impairment testing is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital rate after tax, which is determined using the capital asset pricing model. It comprises a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective industry-specific peer group. The fair value measurement was categorized as a level 3 fair value. The financial projections were approved by management and consist of a detailed planning period of five years.

The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd. The calculations of the assets and liabilities recognized with regard to these facilities are based on statistical and actuarial calculations. In particular, the present value of the defined benefit obligation depends on assumptions such as the discount rate and the pension growth rate used for calculating the present value of the future pension obligations. Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by us also use statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions.

In 2022, total revenue of the underlying global Crop Science market amounted to €69.6 billion, growing at a CAGR of 7.8% from €55.6 billion in 2019 (Roland Berger Report). Out of the approximately €70 billion Crop Science market, active ingredients (including advanced intermediates) manufacturing accounted for approximately €13-17 billion. Active ingredients refer to the chemical compound that is used in the final crop protection product and achieves the desired counteractive properties against pests, such as weeds, insects and fungi, among other organisms. Active ingredients manufacturing refers to a multi-step manufacturing process of the key chemical ingredient within crop protection products that imparts the biological activity to the crop protection products. Within the active ingredient manufacturing market, around 40-50% of the production is outsourced to CDMOs such as us, implying a total addressable Crop Science CDMO market for the CABB Group (“CABB”) of approximately €6.5-7.0 billion in 2022 (Roland Berger Report).

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.1,Crop Science,5.1.2,Key Drivers,"Demand for crop protection products is primarily driven by farmer demand. Increasing demand is expected due to two underlying long-term mega-trends, which overall positively affect the Crop Science market: (1) the growing population and rising middle class; and (2) decreasing arable land per capita. Population growth and the consequent increase in food demand, which, taken with the reduction in arable land per capita available, will drive a strong need for more efficient, higher-priced innovative crop protection products capable of improving farmland yields on available areas (Roland Berger Report). _Growing population and rising middle class_ Growing global population leads to an increased demand for food and crops. Additionally, a higher caloric intake per capita and a fast-growing global middle class also positively impact the future demand for food supply. The total world population is expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.9% from approximately 7.8 billion in 2020 to 8.5 billion in 2030, down from a slightly higher CAGR of 1.2% between 2000 and 2020 (Roland Berger Report). The global middle class population (i.e., households with per capita income between US$10 and US$100 per person per day) drives a stronger demand for food and crops and has grown at a CAGR of 4.4%, from 3.0 billion in 2015 to 3.8 billion in 2020. Forecasts predict a further CAGR of 3.7% from 2020 to 2030 (Roland Berger Report). 90 ----- Source: Roland Berger Report 1) Defined as households with per capita incomes between USD 10 and USD 100 per person per day (pppd) in 2005 PPP terms _Decreasing arable land per capita_ Although arable land has grown slightly in absolute terms, it has decreased in relation to the increasing global population. Available hectares per capita have declined at a rate of -1.1% CAGR from 2000 to 2020 (Roland Berger Report). As a result, achieving target crop yields per hectare within available areas to support an increasing population requires greater efficiency in crop protection, which fosters the need for efficient Crop Science products (Roland Berger Report). Source: Roland Berger Report _Increased prices for crop commodities since 2020_ Prices of crop commodities are a major factor for the Crop Science market, since high (or low) trading prices generally lead to increased (or reduced) farmer income, and as a result increase (or decrease) farmers’ ability to spend on Crop Science products. Furthermore, farmers are increasingly using tools such as digital monitoring of crop areas, which allows them to use more precise, accurate and sophisticated Crop Science products (e.g., small batches and/or targeted applications) to enhance their crop yields. After a long period of stagnation, the prices of 91 ----- crop commodities surged in the second half of 2020 due to increased demand and supply imbalance caused by strong demand from China, unfavorable weather conditions and COVID-19, which led to supply chain interruptions. Similarly, prices have sharply increased in the first half of 2022 as a result of the energy crisis and the overall inflationary environment among other factors. At the end of 2022, prices had decreased slightly but still remained at high levels. Further, because Russia and Ukraine are major producers and exporters of crops, the Russia/Ukraine war has led to a crop supply reduction, which subsequently created a need for higher yields in other countries and drove up crop protection prices. However, the Russia/Ukraine war appears to have had a very limited impact on volumes in the Crop Science market as both countries accounted for less than 5% of the total market value for 2022 (Roland Berger Report). Driven by the foregoing trends, the underlying Crop Science market is expected to experience long-term growth of approximately 2% CAGR until 2027, ultimately reaching approximately €77 billion (Roland Berger Report).

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.1,Crop Science,5.1.3,CDMO,"_General_ The Crop Science CDMO market, which is the key addressable market relevant to CABB, is expected to grow faster than the general Crop Science market. Crop Science CDMO players serve as an outsourcing solution for global Crop Science companies versus the in-house development and manufacturing of crop protection products. The decision of Crop Science players to outsource to CDMO specialists is mainly driven by three factors: (1) technical expertise; (2) capacity availability; and (3) cost considerations and capital expenditure requirements (Roland Berger Report), which are further detailed below under “—Key Drivers.” Over the years, there has been an increase in outsourcing within the Crop Science industry. As of 2022, approximately 40-50% of active ingredient production by Crop Science players was outsourced to contract manufacturers, such as CABB. The CDMO Crop Science market represented about €6.5-7.0 billion as of 2022, having grown at a CAGR of 9-10% between 2019 and 2022. The market is expected to further grow at a CAGR of 4-5% until 2027 (Roland Berger Report). Due to the increasing complexity of new molecules, a lack of available capacities in-house at clients and a high likelihood of customers engaging in cost reduction efforts, it is expected that Crop Science players will outsource an increasing share of development and manufacturing to CDMOs (Roland Berger Report). 92 ----- _Key Drivers (1) Technical expertise_ Among the factors considered, technical expertise and know-how is one of the top decision criteria that companies take into consideration when determining whether to outsource their production. This is explained by the rising complexity of new active ingredient molecules. Synthesis of these molecules requires a higher number of steps, so the production process typically requires specialist know-how. Since major Crop Science players may not always have the complete technical expertise required, they increasingly rely on CDMO partners with an increasing share of their production process expected to be outsourced in the future as a result (Roland Berger Report). _(2) Capacity availability_ Another important key decision criterion for customers when choosing their CDMO partner is suitable capacity availability. Crop Science players do not always have excess capacity to cover growing product demand and consequently rely increasingly on CDMO partners. As major Crop Science players look to outsource their production activities, the ability for CDMOs to offer sufficient fit-for-purpose production capacity as well as flexibility for further expansion is critical (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). _(3) Cost considerations and capex requirements_ The increasing complexity of molecules, more stringent regulatory trends and fast-evolving customer demand patterns mean that major Crop Science players must focus increasingly on research and development, regulatory and marketing activities, and thereby less on growing in-house manufacturing. Against this backdrop, Crop Science players are focused on ensuring cost and capex discipline with regard to production activities, which supports their decision to outsource production to CDMOs (Roland Berger Report). _CDMO Globally_ The CDMO market is expected to grow by a CAGR of 4-5% across geographies, with India as key growth driver and decent growth in Europe at a CAGR of 2-4%, given the different growth dynamics in various locations. Below is a list of geographies in terms of the location of production for the CDMO market. On a regional level, Europe accounted for 20-25% of market value in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2-4% until 2027, primarily driven by the introduction of and increasing demand for new proprietary and complex active ingredients. Europe is home to three of the global Crop Science majors and a strong foothold in the region ensures customer proximity. India is the largest market, accounting for approximately 35-40% of the global Crop Science CDMO market. While outsourcing to China has grown substantially over the last decade, increasing competition from India and concerns over security of supply are expected to limit growth going forward. India is the key historic and future growth driver and is expected to capture a large part of the additionally outsourced production due to strong customer relationships with major customers, high price competitiveness paired with less governmental control compared to China and increasing manufacturing competence. Consequently, India’s Crop Science CDMO market is expected to grow at 8-10% CAGR until 2027, compared to a 15-16% growth rate from 2019 to 2022. North America and Japan, respectively, represent 3-8% and 2-4% of the global CDMO market and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5-7% and 1-3%, compared to 4-5% growth each from 2019 to 2022. The North American market is expected to benefit from, among other things, higher level of regulation and high energy prices in Europe. However, Europe and North America still remain important markets as shown in the graphic below (Roland Berger Report). 93 ----- Source: AgbioInvestor; Roland Berger Report",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Further, there are several Asian players including Deccan (India) and Lianhetech (China) and in North America, CABB’s Jayhawk site competes with Viakem (Mexico) and Grace (US). (Roland Berger Report). Saltigo and CABB are the key European players in the novel active ingredients (AIs) segment. Further, along with Saltigo, CABB is one of the leading players in the Crop Science market in terms of technological know-how, possessing the ability to meet customer demands on a variety of commercial levels. Further, CABB has a strong track record and long-standing client relationships due to its strong customer centricity. CABB has a unique global supply chain structure with CDMO sites in the U.S., Switzerland and Finland. Proximity to the headquarters of key Crop Science players such as Syngenta, Bayer and BASF in Europe and Corteva and FMC in the U.S. constitute an advantage for CABB in the competitive landscape. Certain players in Asia perform better from a price perspective due to lower personnel and infrastructure costs and fewer regulatory requirements. However, price is less important for purchase decisions, as customers typically focus on technical know-how and track record first (Roland Berger Report). The Crop Science CDMO market shows a broad range of growth rates depending on the year of introduction of the respective products. Products introduced after 2010 (“Novel AIs”) experience a higher outsourcing share and are expected to exhibit stronger growth of 10% CAGR or above from 2022 until 2027. Those Novel AIs introduced after 2010 account for approximately 5-10% of the addressable 2022 Crop Science CDMO market. The majority of the market value of products launched before 1990 comprises generic active ingredients (>50%) with an established market position but also lower expected growth from 2022 to 2027 of approximately 2-3% CAGR (Roland Berger Report). As of 2021, CABB, Deccan, Lianhetech, Saltigo, and PI Industries combined accounted for approximately 3237% of the global Crop Science CDMO Market. Together with the remaining five top ten competitors, the top ten players account for approximately 50-55% of the overall Crop Science CDMO market (Roland Berger Report). In terms of the market share in the EU, the Crop Science CDMO market is concentrated, with the top five players in total comprising an estimated market share of 70-75% in 2021.

As of 2022, the total global MCA market represented about 1,100-1,200 ktons. Our MCA is mainly used in the Life Science industry, the Crop Science industry and in Industrials & others. Life Science represented the largest MCA end-market as of 2022, accounting for approximately 40-50% of the market volume. MCA has a large market volume of 520-540 ktons focused on Life Science as of 2022, with a solid growth outlook of 4-5% CAGR (in terms of volumes in ktons) between 2022 and 2027. In 2022, CABB was one of the largest MCA producer in terms of production capacity installed. CABB and Nouryon are considered the leading market players in terms of security of supply and delivering quality and high purity MCA (Roland Berger Report). Other key competitors in this space include PCC Rokita SA (Poland) and Niacet (U.S.). In terms of supply security, we and Nouryon are known to offer highly reliable supplies and are located in key geographic areas in close proximity to key customers (Roland Berger Report). _Key Drivers_ As of 2022, MCA within the Life Science market was expected to grow at a CAGR of 4-5% (in terms of volumes in ktons) between 2022 and 2027, primarily due to the increased focus on hygiene and general health awareness. This is driven by, among others, the following factors: (1) a higher demand for personal care products and detergents supported by COVID-19, which is expected to positively impact the demand for MCA and betaines (partially made up of MCA) in the long-run since they are essential ingredients in producing these personal care products; (2) within consumer products in emerging markets, an increasing switch from solid to liquid products, including soap and dishwashing detergents, which is expected to have a positive volume impact on betaines since they are frequently used in liquid personal care products; and (3) within the food industry, an increasing trend of adding carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a thickening agent or stabilizer in different foods and beverages. As CMC production requires MCA as ingredient, MCA demand is expected to correspondingly benefit. While volumes are expected to grow moderately overall, driven by the aforementioned market-trends, prices are expected to decline after a peak in 2022 because MCA price is strongly linked to commoditized raw material prices, and input costs are typically passed through to customers (Roland Berger Report). 95 ----- Source: Roland Berger Report _MCA Esters_ As of 2022, the global Life Science MMCA and EMCA markets are expected to grow in value by around 4-5% CAGR between 2024 and 2027, following a period of moderate growth or stagnation from 2023 to 2024 and a decline in 2023 due to normalization of energy prices. The underlying volume growth can largely be attributed to growing demand from all end-markets, i.e., food supplements (vitamin A), pharma (contrast agents and piracetam) and the flavor and fragrances industry (Roland Berger Report). We convert MCA to MCA esters, i.e. methylmonochloroacetate (MMCA) and ethylmonochloroacetate (EMCA), with applications such as producing contrast agents, vitamins and other drugs such as the anti-dementia drug Piracetam.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.2,Life Science,5.2.4,DCA,"_General_ DCA is a chemical compound predominantly used as a crucial component in the oligonucleotide synthesis process for next-gen RNA-based therapeutics in pharmaceuticals. It is an essential ingredient in the key process step (detritylation) of siRNA through oligonucleotide synthesis and for the chemical synthesis of DNA templates used to produce mRNA drugs. DCA is the ideal reagent in this process given its purity, acid strength and ease of use. The end-use applications of oligonucleotide-based drugs are in genetic diseases and next-gen cancer treatments (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). Historically, DCA experienced a growth of more than 100% CAGR between 2019 and 2022. DCA is a niche market with €15-20 million in market value as of 2022, and with an estimated market value CAGR of 20% to 65% between 2022 and 2027 (depending upon underlying assumptions, specifically on the performance of the key commercial product on the market). Overall, the pure DCA market is expected to outgrow the underlying market for oligonucleotide-based drugs, as DCA is a main component of blockbuster products as well as other promising drugs in the research and development pipeline. In a conservative case, the DCA market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 20-30% until 2027, assuming limited contributions from the key commercial product and new blockbuster drugs as well as some price decline. In an optimistic case, assuming key product sales grow according to global data forecasts, non-blockbuster product sales develop in line with the oligonucleotide synthesis market (approximately 15% CAGR), and that the blockbuster drugs currently reach commercial launch, the DCA market could grow at a CAGR of up to 60-70%, in a scenario that assumes no price decline (Roland Berger Report). 96 ----- Key competitors in this space include Hongene, a Chinese DCA producer with limited footprint in Europe and other Chinese players that produce DCA but focus on lower purity products. Due to the complexity of producing high purity DCA, other Chinese players besides Hongene are predominantly focused on a lower quality and lower purity level of production than CABB. As a result, European and U.S. distributors typically do not partner with other Chinese manufacturers apart from Hongene due to current quality & purity profiles as of 2022 (Roland Berger Report). _Key Drivers_ The underlying oligonucleotide synthesis market is expected to grow significantly, primarily driven by research and development investments and innovations. Specifically, growth in the oligonucleotide synthesis market is expected to be driven by (1) increased government funding and research efforts to improve genomic technologies (e.g., DNA sequencing) and develop oligonucleotide-based drugs, as well as growing demand for synthesized oligos for use in several pharmaceutical companies’ pipeline drugs; and (2) a broadening field of applications stemming from technical advancements that are expected to further increase importance of oligonucleotide-based drugs (Roland Berger Report). The DCA market is expected to outgrow the oligonucleotide synthesis market, as it is a key input of already marketed and potentially upcoming “blockbuster” drugs (Roland Berger Report). Key drivers include: (1) CDMOs increasing production capacity to meet growing demand from customers along with expected increases in endmarket demand for existing oligonucleotide-based drugs as they receive approvals from regulatory bodies and reimbursement is improved; and (2) ongoing innovation in connection to oligonucleotide-based drugs leading to the discovery of new treatments requiring DCA as raw material for their synthesis in addition to ongoing investigation into DCA given directly as a treatment (e.g., as possible treatment for endometriosis) that will likely lead to new areas of application and increase demand (Roland Berger Report).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Vitamin production using CAE (CMO process) is located in Europe while players in APAC typically use the EMO process. In the pharmaceutical sector, CAE is used as a building block for APIs, e.g., in Cimetidine for treating GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease) and in other molecules used to treat diseases of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. CAE is valued for its reactiveness and the high yields it produces (Roland Berger Report). 97 ----- The non-captive CAE market remains a niche market in Life Sciences with a market value of €15-20 million as of 2022 and an expected growth outlook of 3-4% CAGR between 2022 and 2027 (Roland Berger Report). It is estimated that 50-60% of the companies that require CAE produce it in-house. CAE is typically created as a by-product of other production processes, such as chlorination. As of 2022, the expected growth projection for CAE used in vitamins was a market value CAGR of 3-4% until 2027. Key competitors in this space include Wacker Chemie AG (or Wacker) (Germany) and certain Asian players, such as Sinochem (China). In terms of the end-customers’ key purchasing criteria, including customer relationships and price, there were small differences between the major market players CABB and Wacker, and both were clearly ahead of Asian competition by all metrics except pricing. CABB is focused on the high purity segment in which delivery reliability and price are the most important purchasing criteria (Roland Berger Report). _Key Drivers_ As stated above, as of 2022, the expected growth projection for CAE used as the building blocks for vitamins is 3-4% CAGR until 2027, primarily driven by the following factors: (1) rapidly developing personalized and functional nutrition as consumer and societal expectations are set to move beyond taste and texture and awareness of the importance of a quality nutritional profile grows. Vitamins can improve the nutritional value of both meat and dairy alternatives. Demand is also being driven by (2) the increasing use of feed fortification since farm animals remain an important part of the nutrition of a growing global population. Feed fortification through the addition of vitamins can improve the lifetime performance of farm animals through benefits related to animal health and digestion by extracting more value from the feed. Lastly, (3) a growing incidence of vitamin deficiency observed in patients with certain diseases and an increased prevalence of these diseases is expected to augment market growth for certain vitamins such as vitamin B6 to address autoimmune, kidney and liver diseases (Roland Berger Report).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Caustic soda is used in production of various intermediate products as well as a wide range of end applications such as in chemicals, pulp and paper, and alumina, among others. For example, it is used in the base feedstock for the production of various chemicals as well as in the pulping of wood for paper production or regenerated fibers. Sodium hydroxide is also used in the water treatment process. The volume demand for sodium hydroxide is therefore closely related to GDP development (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). Sodium hydroxide is a by-product of chlorine production. This allows chlorine producers to recycle the chlorine they produce and monetize it. As it is highly commoditized, the supply chains of sodium hydroxide are relatively short and as a result, our target market for sodium hydroxide remains mainly in Europe (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). Overall, the sodium hydroxide market is expected to experience positive volume growth from 2022 to 2027, and is used in numerous end-markets, such as automotive, textile, pulp and paper and household cleaners. The price of sodium hydroxide, on the other hand, is historically volatile and difficult to predict due to its dependency on chlorine production and energy prices. Key indicators point towards a slight decline in 2023 and subsequent years, though price is expected to remain above 2021 levels. For example, PVC consumption, which is the main driver of the supply of caustic soda, is expected to grow by approximately 1% or less until 2026. Electricity price, which is a driver of production cost, started to drop towards the end of 2022 and is expected to drop further in 2024, though it is expected to remain higher than pre-COVID-19. Specifically, pricing of caustic soda reached an alltime high in 2022 with a yearly average of €765/t (WE spot rate), compared to a five-year average of €402/t for 2017-2022 and an average of €260/t for 2020-2021. Caustic soda prices are expected to decrease to the level of €550-700/t in 2023, and then normalize at a longer-term average of €400-600/t from 2024 onwards (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). 100 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.6,OUR BUSINESS Business Overview,5.6.1,,"We are a leading CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organization) and fine chemistry manufacturer with global operations, supplying customized ingredients to major players in the Western Crop Science market, as well as high purity and high-complexity chemical ingredients to customers in the Life Science and Performance Material markets. Our strong technology portfolio, technical know-how and execution capabilities allow us to cover a wide spectrum of highly specialized customer needs, specifications and complexity profiles. Headquartered in Germany, we operate a global network with six production facilities located in Pratteln (Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland), Galena (Kansas, United States), Gersthofen (Germany), Knapsack (Germany) and Jining, Shandong Province (China). Our varied product portfolio is organized across two product groups: (i) Exclusives (tailor-made active ingredients and precursors developed for individual customers on an exclusive basis (our CDMO offering)) and Specialties (highly specialized ingredients with applications in high-margin end-markets) products and (ii) Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products (intermediate and base chemical products such as high purity monochloroacetic acid (“MCA”), chloroacetyl chloride (“CAC1”) and caustic soda across a large purity spectrum with multiple end-use applications). Our products are deeply embedded into our customers’ value chains, often on a near-exclusive basis, allowing us to be aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination and to set up scalable manufacturing facilities and efficient commercial production processes. The combination of our production know-how, lengthy product development processes and contractually agreed capital expenditure contributions for some of our products typically result in high contract renewal rates and low customer churn. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of €755.5 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €162.6 million (21.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin). Between 2020 and 2022, our revenue grew at 23.9% CAGR, whereas our Adjusted EBITDA grew at 20.0% CAGR. Exclusives and Specialties contributed to 56.8% of our revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2022 whereas Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals accounted for 43.2% of our revenue for the same period. Our products are used for end-market applications mainly in: (i) Crop Science (e.g., herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and other livestock and crop protection products), (ii) Life Science (e.g., pharma, personal care, nutrition, fragrances and flavor applications) and (iii) Performance Materials (e.g., curatives in epoxies, polyimides, polyesters and other resin systems used for electronic components, semiconductors and for composites, fibers, films, and foams that provide heat and electrical resistance). These end-markets, in particular Crop Science, have shown resilient historical growth rates and benefit from structural mega-trends that are expected to drive further resilient growth in the near- to mid-term, such as increasing demand for food and need for increased farming yields on the one hand, and an aging population and improving living standards on the other. In 2022, based on internal assessments, we estimate that approximately 50% of our products were used in the Crop Science market, approximately 20% in the Life Science market, approximately 15% in the Performance Materials market and approximately 15% relate to others (e.g., base chemicals and industrial MCA) (measured as a percentage of revenues). Exclusives, our CDMO offering, provides tailor-made active ingredients and precursors tailored to individual customer specifications in Crop Science and are a primary contributor to our overall profitability. Based on customer-developed IP, these products require customized production lines, expansive know-how and close cooperation with our customers. We offer development and manufacturing services for proprietary products on an exclusive and confidential basis to leading players in the Crop Science market such as: BASF, Bayer, Corteva and Syngenta, and we have relationships with nearly all major players in the Western Crop Science market. Our Specialties offering consists of specialty ingredients that leverage our considerable manufacturing expertise to create complex chemical products that serve specific customer needs across a variety of applications in the Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials industries. Unlike Exclusives, these products can be offered to multiple customers at a time. Our offering highlights our excellent production capabilities and knowhow along with our ability to offer specialized technology process and development services which allows us to continuously provide high-quality and purity products to our customers and which we believe is a key differentiator in this field. Our Specialties products are also a strong contributor to profitability, leveraging our close client relationship and high customer “stickiness”. In particular, we offer high value-add products for fast 101 ----- growing applications in Life Science (pharma and personal care as well as nutrition) and Performance Materials markets (coatings, e.g., in electronics or other industrial applications), backed by several attractive long-term customer contracts, which offer high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Customers for our Specialties products include players such as Agilent Technologies, Bayer, Corteva, Deciem/Estee Lauder, DSM, Evonik, Merck, Novartis and Syngenta. In our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, we offer intermediate and base chemical products, such as MCA, CAC1 and caustic soda, that serve as chemical building blocks for other secondary chemical processes with a variety of applications across a large number of industries and markets. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas and we operate state-of-the-art sites, allowing us to provide a full range of purity and quality for our customers. Large parts of our Advanced Intermediates supply agreements feature price formulas that allow us to partially pass on price increases in costs of certain raw materials. Furthermore, we also generate a portion of our revenue from Base Chemicals and other products such as caustic soda, that are generated as by-products from our Exclusives and Advanced Intermediates production lines.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.7,Our Strengths,5.7.1,Structurally growing end-markets and increasing outsourcing trends,"Our underlying key end-markets (Crop Science, Life Science and Performance Materials) are enjoying strong and resilient underlying growth, further supported by increasing outsourcing trends that are reinforcing demand for our Crop Science CDMO offering. In the financial year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated in the Crop Science and Life Science markets (estimate based on internal company assessments), the majority of which consists of our CDMO offering through our Exclusives products and to a smaller degree of contributions from our Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals products. As a result, growth in the underlying Crop Science and Life Science markets, specifically within CDMO products and novel advanced intermediates, represent key growth levers for our business. _Crop Science_ Our addressable CDMO Crop Science market grew by 9% to 10% CAGR between 2019 and 2022, outperforming the underlying global market for Crop Science products which grew by approximately 8% CAGR during the same period (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). Market research indicates continued growth until 2027 with respect to both our addressable CDMO Crop Science market (4% to 5% CAGR from 2022 to 2027) and the underlying global market for Crop Science products (2% CAGR) (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor). For more information on the specific historical and projected growth of the addressable CDMO Crop Science and underlying global Crop Science markets, see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺General.” The growth in the underlying global Crop Science market in particular is underpinned by the following megatrends (see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺Key Drivers” for a more detailed overview) (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor): - Growing population: global population growth drives demand for food and crops; and - Decreasing arable land: arable land per capita is decreasing, requiring efficient crop protection products to increase farming yields. These market dynamics are further supported by several specific trends in the addressable CDMO Crop Science market, including (see “Industry and Market Data⸺Crop Science⸺Key Drivers” for a more detailed overview) (Roland Berger Report, AgbioInvestor, Company Information): - Growth in CDMO outsourcing: customers prioritizing research and development, sales and marketing and digitalization activities and striving to reduce their capital intensity and costs (in 2022, approximately 40% to 50% of active ingredient production by Crop Science Players was outsourced to CDMOs); - Increasing complexity of active ingredient molecules: requires specialist CDMO partners with strong technical expertise and assets fitting into global supply chains of Crop Science players; and - Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements: lead to higher demand for novel active ingredients, often outsourced to CDMOs with highly efficient multi-purpose facilities. 102 ----- Furthermore, historical demand for crop protection products has proven to be resilient to adverse events maintaining a growth trend in spite of temporary downturns. For example, declines in average crop commodity prices (e.g., corn, wheat, soybean) caused by events such as lower pest pressure and economic recessions in production markets such as in Brazil, and North American weather conditions in 2019 led to a temporary downturn in the crop protection market but were followed by year-on-year increases. Furthermore, while agrochemical production was impacted by coronavirus-related restrictions in the first quarter of 2020, it swiftly normalized following an easing of lockdown restrictions. While the coronavirus restrictions did impact labor availability both in terms of production and field work, many countries deemed the agricultural sector to be of considerable importance in maintaining food security, so restrictions on movement were less severe than in most industries (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). The addressable market for novel active ingredients (active ingredients introduced after 2010), a subset of the CDMO Crop Science market, is anticipating significantly higher growth rates at a CAGR of approximately 13.7% from 2021 to 2027, owing to, among other factors, a higher outsourcing rate due to production complexity (Roland Berger Report). Against this background, we act as a key partner for our clients in this area, supporting innovators with our technical expertise and state-of-the-art production facilities. Our Crop Science product portfolio benefits from a modern set of active ingredients. We are not materially involved in the production of raw materials or finished product for glyphosate or neonicotinoids. _Life Science_ Our Specialty products benefit from the strong underlying growth rates in a number of attractive niche markets for specialized Life Science applications. In 2022, the addressable Life Science market accounted for the second largest portion of our revenue after the Crop Science market. Our products in this area consist primarily of Advanced Intermediates products as well as Specialties products. Our addressable Life Science markets grew between 2019 and 2022 and are expected to grow further, driven by structural mega-trends including a global aging population and an increasing disposable income spent on personal care, showing the strength of this segment for our future growth potential (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). For more information on trends driving Life Sciences growth (including niche markets), see “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺Key Drivers.” Individual addressable high growth sub-markets such as the oligonucleotide synthesis market (used for the production of synthetic RNA and DNA templates) increased significantly in 2021 and 2022, and forecasts are estimating future significant growth. See also “Industry and Market Data⸺Life Science⸺General⸺DCA.” While this is in part due to the market’s limited current size, it also highlights how we may be able to leverage our technical excellence to capitalize on developing demand for high-purity ingredients. For example, we are the global market leader and only large-scale Western supplier of high purity grade DCA (a key ingredient for RNAbased medication) in Life Science for pharmaceutical applications (by high purity DCA revenue as of 2022). Furthermore, DCA applications in the production of synthetic RNA and DNA templates have wider uses in the Life Sciences industry than COVID-19 applications (where mostly enzymatic synthesis is employed), so our product has only some commercial exposure to the trends driving COVID-19 vaccines and will benefit from growing end markets due to both increased investments into research and development (e.g. improvement of genomic technologies) as well as broader commercial use (e.g. “oligonucleotide therapeutics”), see “Industry and _Market Data⸺Life Science⸺DCA⸺Key Drivers” (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). Performance Materials_ Our Specialties products with niche applications benefit from attractive market dynamics in addressable endmarkets in the Performance Materials segment, BTDA, 6FDA and other markets, which are expected to grow until 2027 (Roland Berger Report). For more information on projected growth rates, see “Industry and Market _Data⸺Performance Materials⸺Specialty Anhydrides⸺General and “Industry and Market Data⸺Performance Materials⸺Electronic Performance Materials Product⸺General.”_ Our BTDA and 6FDA products are used for numerous applications in electronics, infrastructure and transportation and benefit from favorable macro trends in these sectors, such as growth in smart devices, the switch to 5G infrastructure and higher government and industry spending on infrastructure. Our electronic performance materials product is primarily used in the semiconductor industry, which fundamentally benefits from (i) the introduction of new generation semiconductors, (ii) increasing electrification (e.g., autonomous driving and digital connectivity) and (iii) the rise of artificial intelligence enabled by semiconductors (Roland Berger Report). 103 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We are a trusted partner to major players in the Crop Science market and numerous leading specialties companies in the Life Science and Performance Materials markets rely on our solutions and significant expertise for their products and applications. High customer retention rates serve as a competitive moat against new entrants: For example, in 2021 and 2022, we had an overall average customer retention rate of approximately 98% (based on existing customer revenue over total revenue for the respective year), which illustrates, together with the high rate of contract renewal and lock-in effects, the “stickiness” of our topline in Exclusives. Our average duration of business relationships with our top four customers in Crop Science exceeds 15 years in tenure (based on management estimates between 2020 and 2022) and a number of our Crop Science blue-chip relationships span more than 30 years (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). Together with the high revenue visibility that most of our longer-term contracts in Exclusives provide, our customers’ long-term commitments are supported by a track record of co-investments in production facilities through upfront capital expenditure or top-up pricing over the term of the contract. We supply a multitude of individual products to our top customers, which we believe indicates our customers’ trust in our capabilities and the quality of our varied products. In 2021 and 2022, we supplied more than 10 products for each of our top three customers. Our customer base in particular reflects our established position and depth of integration into their respective value chains, with the top ten customers by revenue across all markets accounting for approximately 60%, based on internal assessments, of our group-wide revenue in the financial year ended December 31, 2022. Our established customer base in our CDMO Crop Science business includes the top five Crop Science majors across all major crop systems in our key end-markets, with whom we work in close cooperation in terms of process development and planning as well as the lifecycle of the project (Roland Berger Report, Company Information). In addition, while agrochemicals are a key end-market for our products, we are diversifying into other applications such as further high-value intermediates within Advanced Intermediates, pharmaceuticals and Specialties. For our Exclusives products in particular, the close customer cooperation enables de-risked investments in growth capex for further capacity and technology expansion through customer contributions (e.g., capex co-investment or ‘takeor-pay’ commitments by customers). 104 ----- Over the last three years, we have established a track record of consistent project wins (at least one major 1[st] campaign project per year), building upon our deep integration into our customers’ value chains and our reputation of reliability and ability to manage complex processes. As of March 31, 2023, we also had multiple projects in varying ramp-up phases, supporting growth of the business.

Due to our high level of integration into our customers’ product development and long contract terms for most of our contracts, we have high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Our long-term contracts often provide for guaranteed volumes in the initial period, contributing to a high contract renewal rate and low customer churn for a large part of our portfolio. Because of our strong market position and customer integration, we also have high visibility into our customers’ future demand and their upcoming product launches. For example, we received customer inquiries from five top Crop Science players for 70% of all active ingredients launched or planned to be launched in the market between 2020 and 2023E (calculated as share of novel active ingredients and advanced/key intermediate launches where we were inquired) and have won projects in novel active ingredients with these players at a success rate of approximately 40% (calculated as the share of projects won if we were inquired). Moreover, our customers in the CDMO business typically contractually agree for new products to either (i) contribute a portion of the capital expenditures related to new product developments and the production line setup, with minimum contract terms providing payback of the capital expenditures incurred directly by us, or (ii) firm take-or-pay agreements with limited capital expenditures contributions upfront. We continue to invest significantly in growth projects to deliver contracted new product wins and in maintenance to safeguard asset reliability. Our disciplined selection criteria in our CDMO business are focused on superior contracts with limited investment periods for growth capex projects where we typically target EBITDA pay-back periods of approximately three years and return rates of approximately 25% IRR secured by binding customer capex or offtake commitments. While this is not achieved in all our projects, we aim to strengthen our product portfolio over time with projects that either match our key criteria or otherwise offer strategic opportunities.

When these benefits are combined, they create a virtuous cycle by minimizing negative environmental impacts, creating cost advantages in production, driving innovation and enabling our long-term competitiveness. Production processes always result in byproducts. We aim to reuse or commercialize such byproducts wherever feasible and avoid waste wherever possible. To this end, we believe we operate a highly efficient circular economy processes and we eliminate waste by developing highly efficient processes with optimized product yields and reusing materials within production cycles. Besides the environmental and sustainability advantages, this type of closed-loop system also has tangible financial benefits, as it can reduce costs for raw materials and waste treatments. In Pratteln, we are contributing to the creation of a circular economy using a “Verbund System”. This enables highly efficient and sustainable chlorination and sulfonation reactions. Chlorine and sulfur trioxide are produced as primary raw materials and used to manufacture a variety of chlorination and sulfonation reagents. In turn, these are used to produce further downstream intermediates and active ingredients. The HCl and SO2 generated as off-gases are separated, purified and recycled, reused or resold. Finally, our production sites benefit from high supply chain resilience through backward integration of key raw materials and production processes for our Exclusives and Specialties Products (by using our Advanced Intermediates production). In particular, our main multi-purpose plant in Pratteln uses an innovative set-up that offers high efficiency production of Exclusives and Specialties products, based on backwards integration of the key raw materials of chlorine. Together with the supply of large volumes of necessary MCA from our sites in Germany, we can therefore contribute to supply resilience, as we are in control of the relevant production steps and at the same time can manage the direct commercialization of side streams generated in the production processes, which are then sold as Base Chemicals. See “⸺Production Facilities.” We benefit from close proximity to our customers’ main production sites in the Western markets and we focus on developing and maintaining strong logistic capabilities to enable seamless fulfillment and integration in the respective customer’s supply chain.

We offer customers the full MCA portfolio spanning across all relevant MCA grades up to ultra-pure qualities as well as all relevant formulations such as solutions, melt and MCA salts (SMCA). Our production facilities benefit from state-of-the-art hydrogenation technology. We are one of the largest European Life Science MCA suppliers (measured by production volume in Europe as of 2022). A significant share of our MCA product is produced for captive demand from certain MCA derivatives in the Life Science business. MCA is further used for (captive) Crop Science demand in Exclusives and Specialties business (Roland Berger, Company Information). Our acid chlorides and chlorine-based products portfolio includes products such as chloroacetyl chloride (CAC1) which is used in crop protection applications as well as in pharmaceutical applications (e.g., pain relievers) and various additional acid chlorides and chlorides products which are used in agrochemical synthesis and are also applied in the synthesis of organic peroxides, car tires, sizing agents, flavor and fragrance, high blood pressure medications, antibiotics and animal feed stock additives. _Base Chemicals_ Our chlor-alkali electrolysis processes (used to create key precursors for our Exclusives and Specialties products as well as the advanced intermediates) yields two main co-products: chlorine and caustic soda. In various chlorination processes, chlorine is partially utilized in the process and with the remainder being transformed into hydrogen chloride and hydrochloric acid as solution. We increase our efficiency by selling the caustic soda, hydrochloric acid and other co-products we cannot recycle back into our production processes to third-party customers. Sales of caustic soda are typically made to customers and other third parties through distributors, with the majority of purchasers located within 300 kilometers of our Gersthofen and Pratteln sites due to transportation costs. The market is partially protected as logistics costs limit longer distance shipping. In Switzerland, where we are the only producer of caustic soda, we sell a substantial part of our base products via pipeline to tenants of the Schweizerhalle industrial cluster based on long-term contracts, offering superior supply reliability.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.14,Our Product Portfolio,5.14.2,Key targets for investment criteria and capex requirements applicable to our CDMO Exclusives projects,"Tailor-made products based on customer-developed IP require custom-built production lines and close cooperation with our customers to achieve the requested quality, volume and product specification. This requires significant ramp-up times and costs to set-up appropriate production lines and processes. We contractually commit to such long-term projects (under contractual frameworks) for a large part of our portfolio with the expectation that we will recover our initial investments in the short-term and achieve attractive returns and profitability growth in the mid- to long-term. If we successfully find projects that match our targeted key investment criteria, we stand to benefit from increased profitability and visibility on the underlying product lifecycle and returns. We aim to find projects that allow an EBITDA pay-back of our capex investment in approximately three years from the start of production. To achieve this, we seek a minimum contractual length for CDMO projects in Exclusives, as well as include other mechanisms (e.g., co-investments by customers) to ensure the recovery of our capex. Our customers cover part of our incurred capex either through initial co-investments or through ‘take-orpay’ clauses committing our customers’ to minimum purchase volumes and prices. This co-investment helps integrate our services into our customers’ value chains and adds to their potential cost to switch suppliers, which generally drives very-high project renewal rates. Our typical CDMO contract models follow one of two contract templates: we either engage in CDMO contracts featuring a facility fee, where customers take on a share of the initial capex investment and our project margins are in line with market levels or, as an alternative, we provide CDMO contracts featuring an offtake arrangement, where the initial capex investment is largely funded by us and our desired return profile is achieved through ‘take-or pay’ contract provisions. As a result, the customer has a limited capex commitment upfront but through a firm offtake arrangement, the customer commits to purchase a certain amount of our future output for an extended period (typically five years). These CDMO contracts usually feature higher product margins to compensate for our larger upfront capex commitment and are oftentimes renewed before the end of their initial term. Furthermore, before committing our capacity to a given long-term project, we try to assess the projected internal rate of return (IRR) of each new project over the span of its predicted lifecycle, and aim to select advantageous returns (IRR targets of 25%). While this is not achieved in all our projects, we aim to strengthen our product portfolio over time with projects that either match our key criteria or otherwise offer strategic opportunities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We generate a significant amount of our Group’s profitability from our CDMO activities in the Exclusives product group through long-term projects for our customers. To a smaller extent, our Specialties contracts are also a strong contributor to profitability. In Exclusives, we also benefit from de-risked growth capex investments as customers contribute to the capex required to set up productions (e.g., co-investment undertakings by customer or ‘take-or-pay’ commitments). This also adds to such customers’ switching costs and helps create long lasting relations due to our integration in their supply chain and generally results in very low customer churn and high contract renewal rates for our Exclusives products.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We have developed long-standing relationships with our key customers, which in many cases span several decades. Our customer relationships benefit from our close integration into our customers’ supply chain and co-investments from key customers into production facilities through their longer-term commitments for certain products. We also benefit from rising outsourcing trends, particularly for our Crop Science customers, as they shift their businesses to asset-light, R&D-centric models. We are regarded as a strategic supplier to some of our top customers, which involves close cooperation with the customer in terms of process development and demand planning. We believe that we are a “key supplier” for several of our customers, which makes us an important partner to the customer and help us to maintain our stable customer base. Moreover, we believe that such supply contracts are less volatile than top-up contracts and substantial capex investment, tiered pricing and constant yield improvement result in higher switching costs for customers to later source products from other suppliers. This has resulted in very low customer churn rates. In 2021 and 2022, we had an overall average customer retention rate of approximately 98% (based on existing 115 ----- customer revenue over total revenue for the respective year) which illustrates, together with the high rate of contract renewal and lock-in effects, the “stickiness” of our topline in Exclusives. Within the Advanced Intermediates portfolio of the Advanced Intermediates and Base Chemicals product group, our products have the following estimated amount of customers as of 2022: (i) for MCA we serve over 50 customers; (ii) for SMCA we serve approximately 50 customers; and (iii) for Chloroacetyl Chloride (CAC1) we serve approximately 15 customers.

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.29,ESG and Sustainability,5.29.1,Environmental,"We consider environmental protection and sustainability to be one of the pillars of our ESG strategy. We contribute to environmental protection and sustainability in various ways, including through operational efficiency (i.e., minimizing negative environmental impacts), creation of cost advantages in production and by driving innovation. We are constantly working on solutions to reduce energy consumption and to optimize energy efficiency, in particular electricity and steam consumption (excluding the power used in our electrolysis plants). Highly specialized measures such as optimized energy usage in distillation, energy-efficient technology for chloralkali electrolysis or measuring energy consumption more accurately with software are helping us to reduce the amount of energy we need for our operations. We believe we operate a highly efficient circular economy production processes and by optimizing product yields and reusing materials within product cycles. For example, the raw materials used in our “Verbund” plant in our site in Pratteln, chlorine and sulfur trioxide, are not only used to manufacture chlorination and sulfonation reagents, but also to produce further downstream intermediates and active ingredients. The “Verbund” plant enables the separation of the off-gases HCI and SO2 which are separated, purified and recycled, reused or sold. Our sites undergo regular audits by Eco-Vadis, the world’s largest provider of sustainability ratings. In the latest ratings conducted in 2022, our site in Kokkola was awarded the platinum rating and our site in Pratteln (Switzerland) as well as the sites in Germany and China were awarded with the gold rating. As part of the audit report, EcoVadis also provides valuable input on areas in which CABB can continue to improve, and we have developed strategies and set key targets to achieve these possible improvements. Operationally, we are employing the newest technology to improve efficiency. The acquisition of new compressors at the German Knapsack site in May 2021 is another example of how we are using energy in a more targeted manner. Compressed air generation is now distributed between two smaller compressors instead of one central machine. Before, all the air used to be compressed to the highest pressure required and then depressurized for other processes, now however, compressed air can be generated directly at the requisite pressure level as needed. This reduces the energy consumption by around 30% in the relevant processes. Another tool at our disposal is the use of even more energy efficient technology. For example, as part of a planned overhaul at the turn of 2019/20220, the electrolysis plants at the German Gersthofen site were upgraded to the latest technology, allowing the membranes to be positioned between the electrodes without any spacing (“zero-gap technology”), with the resulting higher current densities between the electrodes driving significant improvement in electrical efficiency. We are also focusing on renewables with our Finnish Kokkola plant being fully powered by hydroelectricity since January 2020. On the other side, our USA Jayhawk plant sources 40% of its electricity from regionally generated wind energy. Most recently, we committed to invest into a CO2 neutral office building in our site in Kokkola and further committed to reduce our absolute CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 30 ktons by 2025 (against 2019 baseline). 121 ----- In addition to our goals to lower our CO2 emissions, we are working to significantly reduce specific energy consumption (mainly electricity and steam consumption). Furthermore, our energy management at our German production sites are certified in accordance with ISO 50001:2018, with top marks once again awarded following an external audit in 2021. Standard compliance was met in all areas and even exceeded in six of eight standard clauses.

We expect that, in many of the countries in which we do business, the applicable laws, rules and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, will become more comprehensive and stringent over time. We further expect that many environmental laws and regulations will continue to be harmonized at the EU level over the near-to-medium-term. Member states will, however, remain free to adopt laws and regulations that are more stringent than those required by the European Union. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in civil liability, fines or even criminal sanctions. As the applicable regulatory framework and technical standards are subject to revision and continuous development, it is very difficult to accurately predict the future cost of compliance with such regulatory requirements and technical standards. Additional or more stringent laws, rules, regulations and technical standards could increase our costs or limit our ability to continue our business operations in the same manner as we have done in the past.

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.32,Regulation Relating to our Business,5.32.1,Regulation of Chemicals European Union,"REACH The manufacturing, handling, use and trading of chemicals is regulated in the EU and its member states. The EU requires control of the use of chemical products within its borders, requiring all affected industries to ensure and demonstrate the safe manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. “REACH” is the Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006), which came into effect on June 1, 2007, and which has been fully applicable since June 1, 2009, requiring the registration of all chemical substances or preparations manufactured in, or imported into, the EU. Its main objectives include improving the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals and ensuring the free circulation of substances on the internal market of the EU. In principle, under REACH, all manufacturers and importers of chemicals must identify and manage risks linked to the substances they manufacture and market. For substances produced or imported in quantities of one ton or more per year per company, manufacturers and importers need to demonstrate that they have appropriately done so by means of a registration dossier, which shall be submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). ECHA may then check that the dossier is compliant with REACH and will evaluate testing proposals to ensure that the proposed assessment of the chemical substances will not result in unnecessary testing, especially on animals. Where appropriate, authorities may also select substances of concern for a broader evaluation. REACH requires formal documentation of the relevant data required for hazard assessments for each substance registered as well as development of risk assessments for their registered uses. Under certain circumstances, the performance of a chemical safety assessment is mandatory and a chemical safety report assuring the safe use of the substance must be submitted. If there is no registration of the substance, it is impermissible to produce this chemical in, or import it into, the EU (i.e., the ‘no data no market’ principle). Existing registrations need to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated with respect to new scientific knowledge. Furthermore, purchasers of registered chemicals must inform their sellers about the intended use of the chemicals, as the importer or producer must add this information to its documentation. REACH also provides for an authorization system aiming to ensure that substances of very high concern are adequately controlled and progressively substituted by safer substances or technologies or only used where society benefits overall from using the substance. These substances are prioritized and gradually listed on the so-called candidate list for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV to REACH. Once they are included, the industry has to submit applications to ECHA on authorization for continued use of these substances which are otherwise prohibited. In addition, EU authorities can impose restrictions on the manufacture, use or placing on the market of substances causing an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. 123 ----- Manufacturers and importers must provide their downstream users with the risk information they need to be able to use the substance safely. This is done via the classification and labeling system and Safety Data Sheets (SDS). Therefore, the REACH Regulation was accompanied by legislation providing for a comprehensive system on the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 and related European legislation). We produce and use considerable quantities of substances that are subject to the REACH regulation. We believe that we have complied with our current obligations under REACH. As part of a large consortium, the Group is a co-registrant of registrations for chlorine, glycolic acid, MCA, SMCA and sodium hypochlorite. None of our products affected by substances of very high concern (“SVHC”) are listed in the official SVHC-List of the ECHA. As part of the “European Green Deal”, in 2020 the European Commission announced the launch of a “Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability” and a “Zero Pollution Action Plan”, which provided for a revision of REACH. This included, in particular, the approach that the most harmful chemicals should only be allowed if their use was necessary for health, safety or critical for the functioning of society and if there were no alternatives acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health. The Commission’s proposal was subject to comprehensive and controversial discussions with stakeholders and the Commision pushed back the revision of REACH to the last quarter of 2023. A revision of the CLP Regulation is currently in the legislative process. It includes, in particular, new hazard classes for endocrine disruptors and other harmful chemical substances with the aim to better protect humans and the environment from hazardous chemicals. Our biocidal business is particularly regulated by the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012 (“BPR”), which entered into force on September 1, 2013. Biocidal products are used to protect humans, animals, materials or articles against harmful organisms, like pests or bacteria. Under the BPR, the approval of active substances takes place at the EU level and the subsequent authorization of the biocidal products at the EU member state level. Companies have to apply for the approval of an active substance by submitting a dossier to the ECHA. Following the approval of an active substance, companies wishing to place biocidal products on the market in an EU member state have to apply for product authorization. We carefully monitor our compliance with the BPR and are not aware of any infringements in connection with our operations or products. The use of pesticides in the EU is regulated by the Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and other EU legislative acts (such as the Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 on maximum residue levels (MRL) of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and the Directive 2009/128/EC establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides, commonly referred to as the Sustainable Pesticide Use Directive). In June 2022, the European Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on the sustainable use of pesticides, which would repeal and replace the Sustainable Pesticide Use Directive. The proposal sets legally binding targets at EU level to reduce by 50% the use and the risk of chemical pesticides as well as the use of the more hazardous pesticides by 2030, in line with the EU’s Farm to Fork strategy. According to the draft regulation, member states would have some flexibility in setting their own binding national reduction targets within defined parameters, allowing account to be taken of national situations. The proposal would ban the use of all pesticides in sensitive areas. The legislative procedure is still pending in the European Parliament and the Council. _Germany_ We are, inter alia, subject to various notification and labeling requirements and have to comply with certain safety obligations arising under the German Chemicals Act (Chemikaliengesetz), which mainly reflects and accompanies REACH at the national level, but which also establishes further national requirements. As the production and handling of chemicals is the Group’s core business, these obligations are of significant importance for its operations. The Ordinance on Information Requirements relating to Poisonous Substances (Giftinformationsverordnung) was released under the German Chemicals Act. It requires persons who market certain chemical products, in particular biocidal products, to provide information needed for precautionary safety and curative measures and emergency situations. The Ordinance on the Prohibition of Certain Hazardous Substances (Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung) bans or restricts the marketing of dangerous materials, preparations, and products. This ordinance contains requirements that must be complied with when marketing dangerous materials, such as proof of competence and notification, information and recording duties. 124 ----- _Switzerland_ We are subject to various notification, labeling and marketing requirements under Swiss law and must comply with certain safety obligations arising under, among others, the Federal Chemicals Act (Bundesgesetz _über Schutz _vor gefährlichen Stoffen und Zubereitungen, Chemikaliengesetz), which (apart from the product registration_ requirements) is by large compatibly harmonized with REACH but is developed and applied autonomously), the Ordinance on Hazardous Substances (Verordnung über Schutz vor gefährlichen Stoffen und Zubereitungen, _Chemikalienverordnung), the Ordinance on Biocide Products (Verordnung über das Inverkehrbringen von und den Umgang mit Biozidprodukten, Biozidprodukteverordnung), which is largely harmonized to the BPR and the_ Chemical Risk Reduction Ordinance (Verordnung zur Reduktion von Risiken beim Umgang mit bestimmten _besonders gefährlichen Stoffen, Zubereitungen und Gegenständen, Chemikalien-Risikoreduktions-Verordnung),_ which prohibits or restricts the marketing and use of certain hazardous substances and similarly broadly tracks the corresponding EU regulations. _Finland_ We are, inter alia, subject to notification and labeling requirements and have to comply with certain safety obligations arising under the Finnish Chemicals Act (Kemikaalilaki). This legislation mainly reflects and accompanies REACH at the national level in Finland, but also establishes further national requirements. _United States_ TSCA imposes requirements on persons and companies that manufacture, process, distribute, use or dispose of regulated chemicals. Among other things, under TSCA the United States EPA has the authority to: (i) require testing of chemicals; (ii) undertake pre-market review and impose restrictions upon new chemicals; (iii) limit or prohibit the manufacture, use, distribution and disposal of chemical substances; (iv) impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements; and (v) regulate the export and import of chemical substances. The EPA may impose civil and criminal liability for TSCA violations. In June 2016, legislation significantly amending TSCA was enacted into law, entitled the ‘Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act’. The legislation mandates that the EPA conduct safety evaluations for all chemicals in active commerce and determine that new chemicals and significant new uses of chemicals are not likely to present an unreasonable risk before entering the market. Additional risk screening of certain of our products by the EPA could lead to new or more stringent regulatory obligations and/or restrictions, including, potentially, prohibitions on manufacture and sale of certain products. On December 19, 2016, the EPA published a list of ten chemical substances that were the subject of the EPA’s initial chemical risk evaluations, as required by TSCA, which were completed by January 2021 and EPA designated 20 chemical substances as high priority in 2019 for upcoming risk evaluations. Such regulations could result in key raw materials, chemicals, or other substances being classified or reclassified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, users of our products, or our employees. Such reclassification of one or more of our raw materials or products could affect its availability or marketability, result in a ban on its purchase or sale, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification, labelling, or handling requirements. In addition, all pesticide products sold in the United States must comply with FIFRA and most must be registered with the EPA and similar state agencies. The use of certain pesticide products is also regulated by the EPA in addition to various local, state and federal environmental and/or public health agencies. These regulations may, for example, include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product, that certain products be used only on certain types of locations, that users post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, or that may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future, or may ban the use of certain ingredients or categories of products altogether. Our inability to obtain or maintain such registrations, or the cancellation of any such registration of our products, could have an adverse effect on our business, the severity of which would depend on a variety of factors, including the product(s) involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected. We attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute active ingredients, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid or reduce these risks. In addition, numerous state, local and industry groups have implemented so-called green chemistry or similar chemicals-focused initiatives to identify, prioritize, and restrict existing chemicals. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has phased in a hazard communication regulation intended to harmonize the U.S. system of Material Safety Data sheet hazard information with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized 125 ----- System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. Other similar future changes to chemicals regulation in the U.S. could place additional substantial regulatory burdens on the industry. Food Ingredients and Feed Additives _European Union_ With regard to our business on vitamins, we are subject to European and national law on food safety providing for special obligations on the production, marketing, sale and labeling of food ingredients. For example, Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 sets out the general principles of EU food ingredient law and requires, among other things, that food and feed ingredients be traceable to their source. Detailed rules also exist for the authorization of novel foods within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 on novel foods as well as food ingredients based on genetically modified organisms within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed. In addition, there are a number of regulations relating to food improvement agents, including provisions and authorization procedures relating to food additives, food enzymes and flavoring, as well as food ingredients with flavoring properties. Specific limits exist for the use of pesticides and other contaminants, such as dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyl (“PCB”), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and mycotoxins in foodstuffs, foods and food ingredients. Separate legislation regulates the additives that may be used in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. When used as food additives, our products may be required to comply with certain sector specific regulations, such as the European Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives objecting at a high level of consumer health protection by restricting the use of food additives. Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs sets out criteria for the measures and conditions necessary to control hazards and to ensure a sufficient state for human consumption of a foodstuff taking into account its intended use. Under the regulation, food business operators have to satisfy certain hygiene requirements by, among other things, notifying the competent authority, in the manner specified, of each establishment under its control that carries out any of the stages of production, processing and distribution of food, with a view to the registration of each such establishment. Moreover, each food business operator is obligated to put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures based on the “HACCP” (Hazard analysis and critical control points) principles. Regulation (EC) No. 1831/2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition sets out rules for authorizing feed additives and placing them on the market. A revision was announced by the Commission in 2021. The aim of the proposal is to contribute to a more sustainable food production system by establishing new criteria to promote the authorization of feed additives with positive effects on animal welfare and on the environment. The legislative proposal is expected in 2023. _Germany_ In addition to European regulations, EU member states may have enacted further national legislation on regulation of food and feed stuff. For example, the German Food and Feed Code (Lebensmittel- und Futtermittelgesetzbuch) primarily aims to protect consumers from food and feed stuff related health risks. It also applies to the production and distribution of cosmetics. The German Ordinance on Animal Nutrition (Futtermittelverordnung) refers to this register and sets forth various specific rules. _Finland_ In addition to the applicable EU regulation, food and feed safety, food quality assurance, hygiene of food stuffs and food labelling are regulated by the Food Act (Elintarvikelaki), which was renewed and entered into force in April 2021 and the Decree of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on the Provision of Food Information to Consumers (Maa- ja metsätalousministeriön asetus elintarviketietojen antamisesta kuluttajille). _Switzerland_ The Federal Act on Foodstuffs and Utility Articles (Bundesgesetz über Lebensmittel und Gebrauchsgegenstände, _Lebensmittelgesetz) aims, inter alia, to protect consumer health and provide consumer information. A detailed_ framework of ordinances is in place for food or nutrition, its components and additives. 126 ----- _United States_ In the United States, ingredients and additives used in both conventional (human) food and animal feed are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other state and local regulatory authorities, which regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and/or adverse event reporting of food products. The FDA regulates such products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), which defines the term “food” to include, among other things, any articles used for food or drink in man or other animals – such as conventional foods, livestock feed and companion animal food – as well as any components of such articles, such as raw materials ingredients and additives. Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the FDCA, any substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food or otherwise affect the characteristics of food (including any substance intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food) is deemed a “food additive,” and is therefore subject to FDA premarket review and approval, unless the substance is generally recognized among qualified experts as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures or – in the case of a substance used prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food – to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, a standard referred to as “generally recognized as safe.” An animal food ingredient that is recognized in an official Feed Ingredient Definition in the Official Publication published by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (“AAFCO”) is presumed to have met the “generally recognized as safe” standard for the intended use specified in the Feed Ingredient Definition. AAFCO is a voluntary membership association of federal and state agencies that regulate the sale and distribution of animal food. Although AAFCO is not a governmental body and has no official regulatory authority, it is comprised of stakeholders to develop and implement uniform laws, regulations, standards, definitions, and enforcement polices for regulating the manufacture, labeling, distribution and sale of animal food. Most states enforce their own animal feed laws and regulations, many of which are based on model definitions and guidelines developed by AAFCO. The degree of oversight of the implementation of these regulations varies by state, but numerous state frameworks require a state governmental authority review and approval of each product label as a condition of sale in that state, and in some cases, of the constituents or ingredients in the animal feed, prior to authorizing the marketing or distribution of the animal feed or ingredient in that state. In the event the FDA or a state regulatory authority identifies unsanitary conditions, false or misleading labeling, or any other violation of applicable FDA or state laws or regulations, potential consequences include, among other things: warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines (including criminal fines), civil penalties or criminal prosecution. The FDA regulations cover drugs, which the FDA generally defines to mean articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of diseases or other conditions, or that are intended to affect the structure or function of the body of man or other animals. Certain of our compounds may be used as active ingredients in certain anti-aging, acne, sun care or other products that are regulated by the FDA as nonprescription, Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) drugs in the United States. Such OTC drug products are generally subject to regulation pursuant to the FDA’s OTC Drug review process (“OTC Drug Monographs”) which provide rules applicable to each therapeutic category of non-prescription drug, and establish conditions, such as active ingredients, uses (indications), doses, routes of administration, labeling, and testing procedures, under which an OTC drug within that particular therapeutic category may be generally recognized as safe and effective (“GRASE”), and therefore can be marketed without obtaining pre-market approval of a new drug application (“NDA”) or abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). To be legally marketed, among other things, OTC drug products marketed under an OTC monograph must be manufactured in compliance with the OTC Drug Monographs and FDA’s good manufacturing practice requirements for drug products, and the failure to maintain compliance with these requirements could lead to FDA enforcement action. Moreover, a failure to comply with the OTC monograph requirements could also lead the FDA to determine that the drug is not GRASE, and thus is a “new drug” requiring premarket review and approval in accordance with the NDA or ANDA processes, or to make changes to its manufacturing processes or product formulations or labels. Any failure to comply with any requirements applicable to OTC drugs can result in potential consequences that include, among other things: warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines (including criminal fines), civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 127 ----- Cosmetics _European Union_ Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, which came into effect on July 11, 2013, requires producers to carry out a safety assessment of cosmetics and their ingredients prior to their sale on the market. The same regulation also contains lists of substances that are prohibited or restricted in connection with the manufacturing of cosmetics. As part of the “Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability”, a revision of Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 is planned by the Commission in order to better protect the environment and human health. The revision may, in particular, strengthen the requirements for risk management and safety assessments. _Germany_ In addition to applicable EU regulations, the German Food and Feed Code (Lebensmittel- und _Futtermittelgesetzbuch) described above also applies to articles of daily use, such as cosmetics. The German_ Regulation on Cosmetic Products (Verordnung über kosmetische Mittel) stipulates additional notification and labeling requirements for cosmetics. _Finland_ In addition to applicable EU regulations, the Finnish Act on Cosmetic Products (Laki kosmeettisista valmisteista) is also applicable to cosmetics. The Act mainly reflects the European Regulation, but also sets out further sanctions and criminal liability for breaches of the Act or the European Regulation. _Switzerland_ The Federal Act on Foodstuffs and Utility Articles (Bundesgesetz über Lebensmittel und Gebrauchsgegenstände, _Lebensmittelgesetz), described above, also applies on articles of daily use, such as cosmetics. Specific ordinances,_ such as the Ordinance on Cosmetics (Verordnung des Eidgenössischen Departement des Inneren über _kosmetische Mittel) further detail and implement the respective provisions. United States_ In the United States, cosmetic products and their ingredients are subject to regulation by the FDA and FTC as well as various other state and local authorities. The FDCA generally defines cosmetics as articles or components of articles intended for application to the human body to cleanse, beautify, promote attractiveness, or alter the appearance, but not by affecting the structure or function of the body. The FDA’s cosmetic requirements govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, disposal recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of such products. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA; however, certain ingredients, such as color additives, must be pre-approved for the specific intended use in the product and are subject to certain restrictions on their use. The FDA may, by regulation, require warning statements on certain cosmetic products for specified hazards associated with such products. FDA regulations also prohibit or otherwise restrict the use of certain types of ingredients in cosmetic products. In addition, the FDA requires that cosmetic labeling and claims be truthful and not misleading. Cosmetics may not be marketed or labeled for their use in treating, preventing, mitigating, or curing diseases or other conditions or in affecting the structure or function of the body, as such claims would render the product a drug and subject it to regulation by FDA as a drug. The FDA evaluates the “intended use” of a product to determine whether it is a drug, cosmetic product, or both, and considers labeling claims in determining the intended use of a product. The FDA monitors compliance of cosmetic products through market surveillance and inspection of cosmetic manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the products are not manufactured under unsanitary conditions, or labeled in a false or misleading manner. Under recent amendments to the law, manufacturers of cosmetic products will become subject to more onerous obligations of the FDA, including adverse event reporting and record retention requirements, safety substantiation requirements, facility registration requirements, and good manufacturing practice requirements. The FDA has also been granted new enforcement authorities over cosmetics, such as mandatory recall authority, and there will be new cosmetic labeling requirements imposed. 128 ----- In the event the FDA identifies unsanitary conditions, false or misleading labeling, or any other violation of FDA laws or regulations, potential consequences include, among other things: warning letters or untitled letters; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import; recalls or market withdrawals; injunctions; or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.33,Regulation of Manufacturing Sites and Storage Sites,5.33.1,Emissions,"_European Union_ In many countries, the emission of air pollutants, noise, odors and vibrations is governed by specific laws and regulations. The operation of industrial facilities is typically subject to permits, and operators of these facilities are required to prevent impermissible emissions. Operators of facilities are required to maintain all installations in compliance with the respective permits in terms of the reduction of certain emissions and implementation of safety measures. In some cases, a continuous improvement or retrofitting of installations to maintain facilities at state-of-the-art safety standards may be required. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and operators may be required to submit emission reports on a regular basis. Non-compliance with maximum emission levels may result in administrative fines. In January 2011, the European Directive 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions (“IED Directive”) entered into force. It sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities and includes rules aimed at reducing emissions into air, water and land, as well as preventing the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall environmental protection. On April 5, 2022, the European Commission adopted a proposal to revise the IED Directive. In line with the “European Green Deal”, the overall aim of this proposal is to progress towards the EU’s zero pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment and to support climate, energy and circular economy policies. _Inter alia, the new rules aim to ensure full and consistent implementation of the IED Directive across member states, with tighter permit controls on air and water emissions. Under the IED Directive and its implementing law, inter alia, the chemical industry has to consider thresholds regarding various polluting substances, such as carbon monoxide and dust including fine particulate matter. Furthermore, the IED Directive amended European Directive 2008/1/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control which aimed to define best available techniques (“BAT”) as binding standards. In order to define BAT and the BAT-associated environmental performance at the EU level, the European Commission organizes an exchange of information with experts from member states, industry and environmental organizations. This process results in the publication of BAT Reference Documents (“BREFs”). BAT is a dynamic concept and continues to evolve as new measures and techniques emerge, science and technologies develop and new or emerging industrial processes are introduced. In order to reflect such developments and the consequences of such developments for BAT, BREFs are subject to periodic review and update. That is why the IED Directive requires a periodical review of all conditions in existing permits and, if necessary, amendments of these conditions to ensure compliance with the IED Directive. We continuously monitor compliance with the IED Directive and relevant BREFs on an ongoing basis. For example, under the BREF for the production of chlor-alkali the mercury cell technology was phased out by the end of 2017 and we converted our mercury cell plant in Pratteln to a membrane cell plant in 2016. _Germany_ By way of amendments to member state laws, including, for example, the German Federal Emissions Control Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz), the German Federal Water Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz) and the German Act on Recycling (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz), the IED Directive has been implemented in the EU member states, resulting in thresholds, authorization requirements and supervisory obligations for new and existing facilities. Although the IED Directive and its implementation provide transitional provisions, under German law, once a new industry standard becomes binding, existing permits, which are not in compliance with such standard, will not be grandfathered but will be adjusted with respect to the new, binding standard. In order to meet stricter requirements, in particular for dust, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur monoxide and total organic carbon, we may need to incur capital expenditures in order to improve our filter systems and firing processes. 129 ----- _Finland_ The IED Directive was implemented in Finland by the renewal of the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Ympäristönsuojelulaki) in 2014. As a result of the implementation, certain stricter environmental obligations for polluters, more effective supervision of compliance and a supervision fee to be paid by parties holding an environmental permit were included in the Environmental Act. Finland’s first Climate Change Act (Ilmastolaki) entered into force in June 2015 and was renewed in 2022. In the renewed Climate Change Act, national emission cut targets were introduced for 2030 (60%), 2040 (80%) and 2050 (90%) of the emission levels of 1990 in order to reach the general goal of Finland being carbon neutral in 3035. The law was further expanded to also apply to land use and targets regarding the strenghthening of carbon sinks introduced. The Climate Change Act is, above all, intended as a law regarding the public administration’s planning of climate policy. It may, however, impact other Finnish legislation directly regulating the operations of the Finnish companies in the future. _Switzerland_ The Federal Environmental Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Umweltschutz, Umweltschutzgesetz) and implementing legislation aims to limit harmful impacts such as air and soil pollution, noise, vibrations, radiation, water pollution or other interference in water, caused by the construction and operation of installations, by the handling of substances, organisms or waste, or by the cultivation of the soil resulting, inter alia, in thresholds, authorization requirements and supervisory obligations for new and existing facilities. We continuously monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including with respect to permits that are legally required to operate our sites. We anticipate that significant capital expenditures may become necessary to upgrade production plants with new technical equipment to comply with maximum emission levels that may become applicable in the future. _United States_ The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and its implementing regulations, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations govern emissions of pollutants into the air and impose permitting and emission control requirements. Standards promulgated pursuant to the CAA may require that U.S. facilities install controls at, or make other changes to, facilities. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be significant. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements of the CAA and its implementing regulations could result in substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions. The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain permits for the construction, modification, and operation of our equipment, comply with permit requirements, and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our facilities. Measures may need to be taken to comply with various regulations specific to our operations, such as: National Ambient Air Quality Standards applicable to emissions of criteria pollutants such as particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and VOCs; and the New Source Review program requiring that new or modified emissions sources install stringent control technology. We may incur substantial capital expenditures to maintain compliance with these and other air emission regulations that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.33,Regulation of Manufacturing Sites and Storage Sites,5.33.2,Climate Change and Emission Trading,"At the international level, many nations have agreed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCCC”). These GHGs include methane, a primary component of natural gas and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products (among other sources). At the December 2015 Conference of the parties to the UNFCCC in Paris, certain members of the international community negotiated a treaty known as the “Paris Agreement”, which entered into force in November 2016. The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. For this purpose, it requires signatory states to regularly submit their national climate action plans, which in particular set out how those countries seek to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. At the November 2022 Conference of the Parties in Sharm El-Sheik, the signatory states were requested to strengthen their climate action plans, as accelerated action was found to be necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. 130 ----- In November 2021, the international community gathered again in Glasgow at the 26th Conference to the Parties to the UNFCCC (“COP26”), during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs. COP26 concluded with the finalization of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which stated long-term global goals (including those in the Paris Agreement) aimed at limiting the increase in the global average temperature and reducing GHG emissions. These goals were reaffirmed at the November 2022 27th Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (“COP27”). _European Union_ In the European Union, the so-called “European Green Deal”, first presented by the European Commission in late 2019, seeks to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The “European Green Deal” serves as an umbrella for a large number of strategies and policies to achieve climate neutrality, including significant revisions of existing legislation. In this context, the Commission for instance adopted the so-called “Fit-for-55” package, which includes a number of proposals to make the EU's climate, energy, land use, transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The commitment to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 is the EU's contribution to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. The implementation of the “European Green Deal” is on-going, with numerous bills being in the legislative process. Eventually, as a consequence of the “European Green Deal”, European industry is likely to be facing a stricter regulatory framework throughout all sectors. The “Fit-for-55” package provides, amongst others, for a revision of the EU’s Emissions Trading System (“EU",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The EU ETS has been in operation since 2005 already, but the EU’s more ambitious goals in connection",5.34.1,Regulation of Hazardous Incidents,"_European Union_ With effect from June 1, 2015, operators of facilities storing hazardous goods in larger quantities are required to comply with safety standards set forth in Directive 2012/18/EU on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (“Seveso III Directive”), successor of Council Directive 96/82/EC. The provisions are designed to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances (such as emissions, fires and larger explosions) and to limit detrimental consequences in the event of an accident. The degree of additional safety requirements depends on the amounts of various classes of hazardous substances stored in the relevant facility. For this purpose, the Seveso III Directive differentiates between ‘lower-tier establishments’ and ‘upper-tier establishments’ where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or in excess of the quantities listed in the Annex of the Seveso-III Directive. According to the Seveso-III Directive, the operator is obliged to take all necessary measures to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences for human health and the environment. The operator has to send a notification to the competent authority, including information such as the immediate environment of the establishment, and factors likely to cause a major accident or to aggravate the consequences thereof including, where available, details of neighboring establishments, of sites that fall outside the scope of this directive, areas and developments that could be the source of or increase the risk or consequences of a major accident and of domino effects. The operator is required to document the establishment’s major-accident prevention policy (“MAPP”), ensure that it is properly implemented, periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated, at least every five years. The operator must also prepare an internal emergency plan and supply the competent authority with relevant information to prepare an external emergency plan. For upper-tier establishments, the operator has to produce a safety report for the purpose of demonstrating that a MAPP and an associated safety management system have been implemented and ensure that all persons likely to be affected by a major accident receive regularly and in the most appropriate form, without having to request it, clear and intelligible information on safety measures and requisite behavior in the event of a major accident. The EU member states have to ensure that appropriate safety distances between establishments covered by the Seveso-III Directive and residential areas, buildings and areas of public use, recreational areas, and, as far as possible, major transport routes are maintained. We may be subject to restrictions, for instance, in respect of site locations of new plants and expansions to our existing plants. At our sites and facilities, we frequently handle and use hazardous substances in the meaning of the national laws. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with the requirements, if insufficient protection against spills or uncontrolled release of substances are identified in the future, we could incur capital expenditures for technical improvements or maintenance to ensure future compliance. At some of our sites, asbestos has been used in the construction of buildings. Currently, we are not aware of any requirement under applicable environmental laws that requires the remediation of bound or encapsulated asbestos, and we are not aware of any friable asbestos on the Group’s sites. If, however, a building is to be demolished or refurbished, precautions may be necessary and the material must be properly disposed by licensed contractors. _Germany_ The provisions of the Seveso III Directive were mainly implemented into German law through the Federal Hazardous Incident Ordinance (Störfall-Verordnung) as well as, inter alia, the German Federal Emission Control Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz) and the German Environmental Impact Assessment Act (Gesetz über die _Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung)._ 133 ----- _Finland_ The Act on Safe Handling of Dangerous Chemicals and Explosives (Laki vaarallisten kemikaalien ja räjähteiden _käsittelyn turvallisuudesta), the Government Decree on Supervision of Handling and Storage of Dangerous_ Chemicals (Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten kemikaalien käsittelyn ja varastoinnin valvonnasta) and the Government Decree on Safety Obligations on Industrial Handling and Storage of Dangerous Chemicals (Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten kemikaalien teollisen käsittelyn ja varastoinnin turvallisuusvaatimuksista) contain provisions relating to on-site inspections by relevant agencies and the obligation to compile and regularly update safety, rescue and evacuation plans. _Switzerland_ The Ordinance on Hazardous Incidents (Verordnung über den Schutz vor Störfällen, Störfallverordnung) aims at protecting populations and environments of damages resulting from hazardous incidents. Among other requirements, production facilities which exceed certain thresholds provided under the Ordinance on Hazardous Incidents must take appropriate measures to reduce the hazard potential, prevent accidents and limit their effects and file a report with the competent authority indicating the quantity of hazardous substances stored in excess of the relevant thresholds and the expected damage in the event of an incident. _United States_ Prospective United States manufacturing facilities are or may be subject to the EPA’s Risk Management Program (“RMP”) under the CAA, which requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute or store certain highly hazardous chemicals to develop a risk management plan and program for accidental releases of such chemicals. RMP also requires facilities to assess potential impacts to off-site populations in the event of a credible worstcase release and to document the policies, procedures, equipment and work practices in place to mitigate identified risks. Similar risk management requirements are imposed upon our facilities under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act “EPCRA”), which contains chemical emergency response planning, accident release and other reporting and notification requirements which may be applicable to our prospective U.S. manufacturing facility.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The EU ETS has been in operation since 2005 already, but the EU’s more ambitious goals in connection",5.34.2,"Production, Possession and Handling of Waste","_European Union_ Directive 2008/98/EC (“Waste Framework Directive”) provides for the legislative basis of a recycling society in the EU. Its provisions on the collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste requires the EU member states to take appropriate measures for prevention of waste in the first place and to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health or causing harm to the environment. Under the Waste Framework Directive, the EU member states have to include permitting, registration and inspection requirements. In 2018, the Waste Framework Directive was last revised, setting clear targets for reduction of waste and establishing a long-term path for waste management and recycling. _Inter alia, minimum requirements were established for extended producer responsibility schemes to ensure that producers of products bear financial responsibility for the management of the waste stage of a product’s life cycle. In 2020, the European Commission presented a new circular economy strategy (the “Circular Economy Action",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.34,"ETS”). The EU ETS has been in operation since 2005 already, but the EU’s more ambitious goals in connection",5.34.3,,"with the “Fit-for-55” package triggered the need for a revision. The relevant EU institution reached agreement on the revision in December 2022, but the revised text has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the EU. The EU ETS is based on the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC, which was transformed into national law at the level of the EU member states. Through the introduction of a trading system for emission allowances, the EU intended to considerably reduce the output of greenhouse gases. The EU ETS covers about 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions and limits emissions from approximately 10,000 installations in the power sector, the manufacturing industry and commercial aviation between EU/EEA countries. Industrial sites to which the EU Emission Trading System (“ETS”) applies must surrender allowances for their greenhouse gas emissions. One allowance grants the right to emit one ton of greenhouse gases. The allowances are put on the market by the EU member states via auctions. Industrial operators can buy the allowances directly in such auctions or at a later stage on the secondary market. Sectors at risk of relocating their production outside of the EU (so-called carbon leakage) can, to a certain extent, claim allocation of allowances for free. There is an overall cap of allowances put on the market per year, which is reduced annually in order to achieve a gradual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Under the currently applicable ETS, the EU-wide cap is lowered annually by a linear factor of 2.2% of the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU in the second trading period (2008 through 2012). In the recent discussions to revise the EU ETS Directive, the relevant EU institutions agreed on a one-off reduction of the EU-wide quantity of allowances by 90 million in 2024 and by 27 million in 2026 respectively and on an annual reduction of the overall cap by 4.3% from 2024 to 27 and by 4.4% from 2028 to 2030. The relevant institutions also agreed that, for a number of sectors at risk of carbon leakage, free allocation will be phased out gradually over the coming years. Instead, those sectors will be subject to another system addressing carbon leakage: the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (“CBAM”). The CBAM intends to equalise the price of carbon between products manufactured within the EU and imported products. In practice, EU importers will need to buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price that they would have paid if they had manufactured the products in the EU. As such, the CBAM aims at ensuring that the EU’s climate goals are not undermined by the relocation of production sites to countries with less ambitious carbon reduction policies. To date, the Group’s emissions have not exceeded the thresholds triggering the applicability of the ETS. However, we closely observe the emission trading and its legal amendments by the EU as the thresholds may be decreased by the European Union and the regime may become applicable to our operations in the future. At least one amendment of the EU ETS Directive the relevant EU institutions agreed on will affect our business. This relates to the establishment of an additional emissions trading scheme for emissions from buildings and road transport and certain industrial sectors. The scheme will apply to the emissions caused by relevant fuel use. The actors 131 ----- obliged to buy allowances for those emissions will not be the consumers of the fuels, but the suppliers. However, suppliers will hand down their costs to their customers, including us. _Germany_ In Germany, the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC has been implemented by the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz), which provides the basis of the German emission trading scheme. Moreover, plant operators are required to submit monitoring reports on a regular basis. In addition, a national emissions trading scheme for combustibles was established by the Federal Act on the Trade with Emissions caused by Combustibles (Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz) and has been in place since 2021. Under this scheme, the suppliers of combustibles are obliged to buy allowances for the emissions that will be generated by the incineration of the combustibles. In practice, the suppliers hand down the costs for the allowances to their customers. _Finland_ In Finland the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC has been implemented by the enactment of the Finnish Emission Trading Act (Päästökauppalaki). Under the Act, certain plant operators have to apply for emissions allowances, monitor emission levels and fulfil reporting duties towards the relevant authorities. _Switzerland_ The Federal CO2 Act (Bundesgesetz über die Reduktion der CO2-Emissionen, CO2-Gesetz), inter alia, provides for levies for the use of fossil fuels and energy sources for energy production as a measure to achieve the national greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Exemptions are available for companies in certain industries obliged or opting to participate in the Swiss emissions trading system (which is linked to the EU emissions trading system) or entering into emission reduction undertakings with the Federal Government. Following the rejection of a propsed revision of the CO2 Act in a popular referendum in June 2021, the Swiss Federal Council has published a new proposal for a revised CO2 Act in September 2022. However, such revision has yet to pass parliament and, potentially, a popular referendum. In the interim, the CO2 Act has been updated to align the reduction target with Switzerland’s international commitments until 2024 and extend certain emissions reduction instruments which would otherwise have expired. _United States_ Regulation of GHGs in the United States is currently subject to complicated domestic and international political, policy and economic dynamics, and the regulatory landscape is rapidly changing. Current and prospective United States operations may result in emissions of GHGs and may be energy-intensive and require the purchase of electricity, the generation of which often results in emissions of GHGs. The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment. In response, the EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA regulating emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants and industrial facilities. The EPA’s regulations require such sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) prior to construction or a major modification, as well as Title V operating permits. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits are required to implement ‘best available control technology’, which can include carbon efficiency standards, GHG emission concentration limits, specific technology requirements or other measures. In June 2019, the EPA implemented the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which provided for controls on emissions associated with power generation. Since its publication, the ACE rule has been litigated and brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, reversed the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision to vacate the ACE rule and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court’s opinion issued on June 30, 2022. The EPA may in the future issue a new proposed rule that would effectively replace the ACE rule. In August 2022, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which appropriates significant federal funding for renewable energy initiatives and, for the first time ever, imposes a fee on methane emissions from certain facilities. Future changes could re-introduce stricter requirements (such as those that previously existed under the ‘Clean Power Plan’), which would increase our operating costs. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States on an annual basis. We may be required to monitor GHG emissions from prospective United States operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule and may also be required to ensure our monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations. In addition, in March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related data risks and opportunities, including financial 132 ----- impacts, physical and transition risks, related governance and strategy and GHG emissions, for certain public companies. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a significant number of U.S. states, including Kansas, have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, including through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG gas cap-and-trade programs. It is difficult to predict the form for such regulation that the U.S. Congress or U.S. states may adopt in the future (such as a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The new plan,5.35.1,Regulation on the Use of Water Resources,"We are subject to several laws at the supranational and national levels relating to the use of ground and surface water in the jurisdictions in which we operate. _European Union_ Directive 2000/60/EC establishing a framework for European Community action in the field of water policy(“Water Framework Directive”), requires EU member states to achieve a good qualitative and quantitative status of all water bodies by 2015, a deadline that can be postponed to 2027 if various conditions in the legislation are applied. Its main goals include expanding the scope of water protection to all waters, including surface waters and groundwater, water management based on river basins, a ‘combined approach’ of emission limit values and quality standards. The latest report from the European Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, dated 15 December 2021, concludes that most member states have made progress in identifying gaps and the measures required to achieve good status of water bodies. However, the distance to be covered to full compliance with the Directive’s objectives is still considerable. Groundwater is protected by both the Water Framework Directive and Directive 2006/118/EC (“Groundwater",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The new plan,5.35.2,,"focuses on the design and production for a circular economy, with the aim to ensure that the resources used are kept in the EU economy for as long as possible. Under the new action plan, a number of proposals and measures have been adopted. On January 25, 2022, the European Commission launched a call for evidence for an Impact Assessment that will support the revision of the Waste Framework Directive. The European Commission’s proposal for the revision of the Waste Framework Directive is expected to be published in Q2 2023. It aims to improve the overall environmental outcome of waste management in line with the waste hierarchy and the implementation of the polluter pays principle. In most jurisdictions where we operate, we are subject to statutory provisions regarding waste management. These provisions may govern permissible methods of, and responsibility for, the generation, handling, possession, discharge and recycling of waste depending, among other things, on the dangers posed by the waste. In particular, the discharge of waste is often restricted to licensed facilities. In many European jurisdictions, plants must use licensed contractors for the disposal of hazardous or nonhazardous waste. 134 ----- _Germany_ Germany transposed the Waste Framework Directive into national law by the Act to Promote Circular Economy and Safeguard the Environmentally Compatible Management of Waste (“Circular Economy Act”, _Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz). Under the Circular Economy Act (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz), generators, owners,_ collectors and transporters of waste must demonstrate to the competent authority and to other parties that they have properly disposed of hazardous waste (gefährliche Abfälle) by proof of waste disposal (Entsorgungsnachweis). Documentation requirements include certain details regarding the handling, type, amount and origin of hazardous waste. _Finland_ In Finland the Waste Framework Directive has been implemented through the enactment of the Finnish Waste Act (Jätelaki) and the Government Decree on Waste (Valtioneuvoston asetus jätteistä), which includes detailed regulations for the handling, labelling and transportation of waste. The Finnish Waste Act was subject to an extensive reform which entered into force in July 2021. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable waste management laws and continuously attempt to reduce waste at our sites. Moreover, all of our sites comply with the requirements of ISO 14001 and the Ecomanagement and Audit Scheme. _Switzerland_ The general principles on the disposal of waste are outlined in the Federal Environmental Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Umweltschutz, Umweltschutzgesetz), the Waste Ordinance (Verordnung über die _Vermeidung und die Entsorgung von Abfällen,_ _Abfallverordnung) and the Ordinance on Dealing with Waste_ (Verordnung über den Verkehr mit Abfällen). The provisions on the federal level partially delegate duties to the cantons, and accordingly the respective cantonal laws on waste apply in addition. Hazardous waste (Sonderabfälle) is generally subject to specific prevention and disposal requirements. _United States_ The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Under RCRA, persons may be liable at sites where the past or present storage, handling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where disposal occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the disposal occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under RCRA is strict and, under certain circumstances can be joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Groundwater Directive lays down detailed quality criteria for the assessment of the,5.36.1,Regulation on Soil Contamination,"Operation of a chemical manufacturing business involves the risk of environmental damage, such as soil and groundwater contamination. In that respect, we are subject to national provisions that may impose obligations related to remediation measures or compensation on us. _European Union_ On the European level, liability for contamination of soil and groundwater has, to date, not been subject to specific regulations or a protection policy. Some soil protection aspects can be found scattered in various legal documents, hence different policies can contribute to protect soil. This is the case with many provisions in the existing environmental legislation in areas such as water, waste, chemicals, industrial emissions, nature protection and pesticides. However, these provisions do not establish a comprehensive soil protection regime including liability for soil and groundwater contamination. On November 17, 2021, the EU Commission adopted a new EU Soil Strategy for 2030. It provides the framework and concrete steps towards protecting and restoring soils, and ensuring that they are used sustainably. As part of this, a new Soil Health Law has been announced to protect and restore soils and ensure that they are used sustainably. The proposed legislation aims to help achieve healthy soils by 2050, with concrete actions by 2030. It will do so by identifying the key soil threats in the EU, such as erosion, floods and landslides, loss of soil organic matter, salinization, contamination, compaction, sealing, as well as loss of soil biodiversity. The European Commission’s adoption is planned for Q2 2023. _Germany_ Under the German Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz) and several regulations promulgated thereunder, owners of land and operators of facilities are required to prevent any contamination of the soil by taking necessary precautions. If any soil contamination (schädliche Bodenveränderung) has occurred, or where pollution was caused in the past (Altlasten, “past-pollution”), owners of land, operators of facilities, the party having caused the pollution or its universal successor (Gesamtrechtsnachfolger) and the previous owner if such owner transferred title to the real property after March 1, 1999 and knew, or should have known, of the contamination or past pollution, may be held responsible for investigation and remediation measures and cost thereof. In certain cases, a party may even be held liable for the entire cost of remediation, irrespective of its fault, the lawfulness of disposal or the actions of other parties. Non-compliance with the obligations under the applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative fines or, in certain cases, criminal liability. _Finland_ Under the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Ympäristönsuojelulaki), the polluter is primarily responsible for remedying pollution to groundwater or soil. However, if the polluter cannot be determined or found or is unable or neglects to carry out its clean-up obligations, the current possessor (i.e., tenant or owner) of the contaminated site can be held liable for reasonable remedial measures if the possessor knew, or should have known, about the contamination at the time the site was acquired, or if the owner consented to the polluting activity. The Finnish Environmental Protection Act applies only to pollution that has occurred on or after January 1, 1994. For contamination that occurred before this date, liability is based on the then applicable Waste Act (Jätelaki) and Waste Management Act (Jätehuoltolaki) and, in certain cases, also the Water Act and the Health Care Act (Terveydenhoitolaki). 137 ----- _Switzerland_ The Federal Environmental Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Umweltschutz, Umweltschutzgesetz) and implementing legislation requires owners of land and operators of facilities to prevent soil contamination by taking necessary precautions. According to the Ordinance on the Remediation of Polluted Sites (Verordnung über die _Sanierung von belasteten Standorten, Altlasten-Verordnung), sites which have, or which are expected to have, a_ harmful and adverse impact on soil, must be registered in a special cadaster and adhere to certain examination, monitoring and remediation measures. This is particularly relevant if the owner or operator intends to modify its facilities, which is generally permitted only if such modification would not lead to the requirement of remediation. If a facility does require remediation, such modification is only permitted if it is undertaken in connection with the facility’s remediation. _United States_ Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state laws, certain persons may be liable at sites where or from a release of hazardous substances has occurred or is threatened. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, retroactive and joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release or threatened release of hazardous substances, as well as any subsequent monitoring.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

CABB’s obligations under it reach beyond the rule of German civil liability for ground water and soil contamination and cover environmental losses that may not be eligible for compensation under other laws. The obligations and liabilities under the German Environmental Damage Act constitute public law obligations to avoid or remedy environmental damage. In addition, nongovernmental environmental organizations may institute legal proceedings in the event the relevant authority has failed to take the necessary steps for enforcement. _Finland_ The Finnish Act on Compensation for Environmental Damage (Laki ympäristövahinkojen korvaamisesta) establishes a compensatory damages regime for personal injuries, damage to property and in certain cases for financial losses sustained from pollution of water, air or soil as well as from noise, vibrations, radiation, light, heat, odor or from other similar nuisances. Furthermore, the act regulates compensation for clean-up costs as well as preventive and remediation measures. The person whose activity has caused the environmental damage, a person comparable to the person carrying out the activity causing the environmental damage, or the person to whom the activity which caused the environmental damage has been assigned, if the assignee knew or should have known, at the time of assignment, about the loss or the nuisance or the threat of the same, is liable to compensate for the damage. Furthermore, our Finnish companies are required to carry insurance to comply with the Finnish Environmental Damage Insurance Act (Laki ympäristövahinkovakuutuksesta) which establishes a complementary compensation scheme if the party liable for the environmental damage is insolvent or cannot be identified. _Switzerland_ Under the Federal Environmental Protection Act (Bundesgesetz über den Umweltschutz, Umweltschutzgesetz) the operator of an establishment or installation posing a particular risk to the environment is liable for any damage resulting from harmful impact as a result of the realization of that risk regardless of fault, unless loss or damage was caused by force majeure or by gross negligence on the part of the injured party or a third party. 138 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Groundwater Directive lays down detailed quality criteria for the assessment of the,5.36.3,Handling and Transportation of Hazardous Goods,"We are involved in the carriage of hazardous goods as, e.g., loader and unloader of such goods and are subject to specific requirements related to such carriage. At the international level, the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road as of September 30, 1957 (Accord européen relatif au _transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route, “ADR”), as last amended on January 1, 2023,_ includes provisions applicable to the carriage of dangerous goods on roads. Pursuant to the ADR, dangerous goods, as a general rule, may be carried internationally in road vehicles subject to compliance with a number of conditions, such as packaging and labeling requirements. Specific dangerous goods (e.g., goods which are poisonous and explosive at the same time) are excluded from carriage on the road. The ADR has been implemented and supplemented by many countries in which we operate. _European Union_ Directive 2008/68/EC of September 24, 2008 on the inland transport of dangerous goods establishes a common regime for all aspects of the inland transport of dangerous goods, by road, rail and inland waterways within the European Union and incorporates the ADR into European law. _Germany_ In Germany the ADR is implemented by the Ordinance on Hazardous Goods for Road, Rail and Inland Shipping (Gefahrgutverordnung Straße, Eisenbahn und Binnenschifffahrt), an ordinance passed under the Hazardous Goods Act (Gefahrgutbeförderungsgesetz). _Finland_ In Finland, the transportation of hazardous goods is regulated by the Act on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (Laki vaarallisten aineiden kuljetuksesta) and the Government Decree on the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road (Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten aineiden kuljetuksesta tiellä). _Switzerland_ In Switzerland, the ADR is implemented through the Ordinance on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods on the Road (Verordnung über die Beförderung gefährlicher Güter auf der Strasse) and the Ordinance regarding Persons Responsible for the Transportation of Hazardous Goods on Roads, Rail and Bodies of Water (Gefahrgutbeauftragtenverordnung).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Groundwater Directive lays down detailed quality criteria for the assessment of the,5.36.4,,"groundwater’s chemical status including standards set on EU level and requirements for threshold values to be set 135 ----- at the EU member state level. It contains criteria for the identification and reversal of pollution trends and requires EU member states to establish measures to prevent the input of hazardous substances into the groundwater and limit the introduction of other pollutants. On October 26, 2022, the European Commission published a proposal amending the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive, which has been in European Parliament’s committees since late January 2023. The initiative updates the lists of priority substances for surface and groundwater and their associated legal threshold values that are used to assess chemical status under the Water Framework Directive. It also addresses monitoring and reporting of concentrations and measures. The discharge of waste water and its treatment is regulated by EU Council Directive 91/271/EEC of May 21, 1991 (“Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive”).This Directive concerns the collection, treatment and discharge of urban waste water and the treatment and discharge of waste water from certain industrial sectors. Its aim is to protect the environment from any adverse effects caused by the discharge of such waters. The Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive is currently under revision. The European Commission proposal dated October 26, 2022 aims at better protecting the health of humans and the environment. More specifically, the revision aims at, inter alia, making industry responsible for treating toxic micro pollutants that are released into the environment from the use of their products (the “polluter pays” principle). To that end, the revised Directive will introduce extended producer responsibility in order to have the industry pay for the treatment of the harmful pollutants that are released from the use of their products. The proposal concentrates on especially harmful residues from the pharmaceutical and cosmetics sector. Going forward, the European Commission will assess if other sectors can be added to the extended producer responsibility scheme. In most of the EU member states, the use of water requires a permit and is strictly regulated to avoid any contamination of ground or surface water, such as through the disposal of sewage or waste water and the handling of potentially dangerous materials. For example, the discharge of any pollutant substances into the surface water may be subject to a permit whereas the discharge of any such substances into the ground water may generally be impermissible. Under the national law of some EU member states in which we operate, water permits may be granted for specific periods of time, or may be reviewed after a certain period, and, therefore, must be renewed frequently. In certain circumstances such water permits may be revoked without compensation. For these activities appropriate permits to use and discharge water must be obtained and maintained during the operation of our plants and sites. We currently hold all required water permits. However, such requirements, as well as the terms of the permits we hold, may materially affect our operations by restricting the discharge of pollutant substances and waste water exceeding certain temperatures and certain maximum levels, including storm-water run-offs, directly or indirectly into public waters. We have been, and will continue to be, required to incur significant capital expenditures and operating cost in order to maintain and upgrade our production sites and facilities to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits, and to obtain and maintain all necessary permits. _Germany_ In Germany, the Water Framework Directive was transposed into national law via amendments to the Federal Water Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz) and water legislation of the federal states, as well as the adoption of ordinances at the level of the federal states. The Groundwater Directive was implemented by the German Ordinance on Groundwater (Grundwasserverordnung), ensuring a uniform level of groundwater protection throughout Germany. _Finland_ In Finland, the protection of ground and surface water as well as regulation regarding the disposal of wastewater is included in the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Ympäristönsuojelulaki) and the Govenrment Decree on Substances that are Dangerous and Harmful for the Water Environment (Valtioneuvoston asetus vesiympäristölle _vaarallisista ja haitallisista aineista). The Environmental Protection Act includes a prohibition to pollute and_ endanger the quality of ground water. The Finnish Water Act (Vesilaki) regulates the use of ground and surface water, which generally requires permission by the competent authorities. _Switzerland_ In Switzerland, the Federal Act on Water Protection (Bundesgesetz über den Schutz der Gewässer, _Gewässerschutzgesetz) and the respective ordinance (Gewässerschutzverordnung) aims to protect ground and_ surface water from pollution and other harmful impact and hence, inter alia regulates the disposal of sewage or 136 ----- waste water and the handling of potentially dangerous materials and requires cantons to implement measures for groundwater protection Furthermore, the use of public waters generally requires a permit or concession by the competent authorities. _United States_ The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and subsequent amendments, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a CWA permit. The CWA also requires many facilities to develop and maintain plans for preventing and responding to spills of hazardous substances, called Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans, and certain high volume hazardous substance handling/storage facilities are required to prepare and maintain a more extensive plan called a Facility Response Plan. Violations of the CWA can result in administrative, civil or criminal sanctions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Under such laws and regulations, employers typically must establish the conditions and the flow of work in a manner that effectively prevents dangers to employees. In particular, employers must observe certain medical and hygienic standards and comply with certain occupational health and safety requirements, such as permissible maximum levels for noise at the work place, the use of personal protective equipment and requirements relating to maximum temperatures and air ventilation. _European Union_ The applicable occupational health and safety regulatory regime in the European Union includes a number of Directives which require employers to provide for their employees' safety. In particular, there is Council Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work and Council Directive 91/383/EEC supplementing the measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of workers with a fixed-duration employment relationship or a temporary employment relationship. _Germany_ In Germany, these Directives were transposed into German law by the German Act on Occupational Protection (Arbeitsschutzgesetz) and the German Act on Occupational Safety (Arbeitssicherheitsgesetz), which require employers to provide for their employee's safety. These general obligations are substantiated in several ordinances under the respective laws, which are further detailed in technical guidelines. The applicable occupational safety regulatory regime also includes the German Ordinance on Occupational Safety (Betriebssicherheitsverordnung), 139 ----- the German Ordinance on Requirements for Workplaces (Arbeitsstättenverordnung) and a number of technical guidelines enacted under these ordinances. In general, compliance with employment safety regulations is subject to regulatory supervision. _Finland_ The Occupational Safety and Health Act (Työturvallisuuslaki) states that employers have a duty to take care of the safety and health of their employees while at work by taking the necessary measures. _Switzerland_ The Federal Employment Act (Bundesgesetz über die Arbeit in Industrie, Gewerbe und Handel, Arbeitsgesetz) states that employers are responsible for taking appropriate measures to protect their employees’ health. Ordinance 3 to the Employment Act regarding Health Protection (Gesundheitsschutz) specifies the detailed duties, for instance regarding the construction of the buildings which are used by the employees, hygienic conditions, protective equipment and working clothes. _United States_ Any current and future United States operations are, or will be, subject to OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, EPCRA and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Of particular relevance to any prospective United States manufacturing operations, OSHA’s standard on Process Safety Management (“PSM”) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals contains requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous chemicals. OSHA’s PSM regulations are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of unexpected releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive liquids and gases in chemical processes. PSM covers facilities that deal with any of certain listed toxic and reactive chemicals and flammable liquids and gases in amounts over specified threshold quantities. PSM requires process hazard analysis, a systematic study of events that could cause hazardous substance releases and the safeguards to prevent them. Employers must perform an initial hazard analysis on all processes covered by the standard and update the analysis at least every five years. Among other things, PSM also mandates written operating procedures, employee training, pre-startup safety reviews, evaluation of mechanical integrity of equipment, written procedures for managing change, investigation of incidents involving releases or near misses of covered chemicals, emergency action plans and compliance audits.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The remuneration for the generation of renewable energy was balanced by a levy that was imposed on the consumers of energy (“EEG-levy”) until 2022.

Our German sites currently benefit each from an arrangement on individual network tariffs with the responsible network operator. If the consumption related thresholds are not met by the relevant site in a calendar year, the 140 ----- difference to the regular network tariff must be paid to the network operator for such calendar year retroactively. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether we may have to pay the difference to the full network tariff retroactively or whether the eligibility criteria may be amended in the future, which could result in a partial loss of the individual network tariffs.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that Obligor, Material Company or Third Party Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below. To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below. If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities. Subject to certain netting and set-off rights, each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, a Material Company or a Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions. _Security Enforcement Regime Enforcement of Security_ The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as specified in the provisions described below. An “Instructing Group” means: (i) prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than fifty (50)% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security” below; (ii) on or after the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and (iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors representing more than fifty (50)% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”), provided that, in each case, the Super Senior Credit Participations, the Senior Secured Credit Participations, the Second Lien Credit Participations and the Topco Credit Participations of a Sponsor Affiliate (each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (as applicable) shall, for the purposes of this definition, be deemed to be zero. 162 ----- _Enforcement of Transaction Security_ The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable, in accordance with its terms, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties. The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not either made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions they reasonably believe to be consistent with the Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the Enforcement Objective (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to (A) enforce or cease enforcing or (B) require any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to (A) enforce or cease enforcing or (B) require any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors) where the rights of the Topco Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give such instruction and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions. “Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, (i) the method of enforcement chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over EUR 5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is so requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party financial adviser. _Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_ Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit. _Manner of Enforcement_ If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco Independent 163 ----- Transaction Security in such manner (including the selection of any administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action). No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to, any of the Transaction Security or to exercise any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent. The Secured Parties grant (and undertake to grant in favour of the Security Agent at its request, by means of a notarized power of attorney (and apostilled) if necessary), as many powers as the Security Agent may require in order to take all necessary action in order to enforce any of the Transaction Security pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. _Security Held by Other Creditors_ If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by the relevant instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above. _Enforcement Regime Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_ Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien Creditors, with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure. _Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_ Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group: (i) no Topco Creditor or Topco Investor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise (to the extent applicable) require the enforcement of any Transaction Security (including the crystallization of any floating charge forming part of the Transaction Security); (ii) no Topco Creditor nor Topco Investor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action (as defined below) against any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (other than in each case (and to the extent not restricted by (i) above and (iii) below) against a Topco Borrower in relation to the Topco Group Liabilities); and (iii) no Topco Creditor nor Topco Investor nor Topco Borrower shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action (as defined below) in relation to Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, except in the case of each of (i) through (iii) as set out under “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below and provided that no such action required by an Instructing Group need be taken except to the extent that such Instructing Group otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action. Other than as restricted by (i) and (iii) in the paragraph above, any Topco Creditor may at any time take any Enforcement Action (as defined below) available against any person that is not a member of the Senior Secured Group, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Topco Finance Documents. “Enforcement Action” is defined as: (i) in relation to any liabilities (other than unsecured liabilities) (A) the acceleration, putting on demand, making of a demand, requiring a member of the Topco Group or Third Party Security Provider to acquire such liabilities (subject to certain exceptions), exercising of rights of set-off (other than certain netting under hedging agreements or as otherwise permitted under the Secured Debt Documents) or (B) suing or commencing proceedings against any member of the Topco Group or a Third Party Security Provider in relation to such liabilities;

Under the Securitization Program, the sellers offer to sell and assign eligible receivables on a revolving basis to the purchaser, without recourse, and the purchaser is committed to purchase such eligible receivables for a specified purchase period, subject to certain conditions. The aggregate of all purchased receivables shall not exceed €50,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: €30,000,000).

The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Listing and General Information.” The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) redeem the Existing Notes in full (including paying the accrued and unpaid interest), (ii) pay the applicable redemption premium for the Existing Notes, and (iii) pay related fees and expenses, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior basis. See “—The Note Guarantees.” The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed_ Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future (the “Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will: - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee, including that Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Facility Agreement and certain cash management obligations and certain Hedging Obligations; provided that, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of a distressed disposal of the Collateral or an enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, creditors under the Revolving Facility and certain other future super priority indebtedness permitted under the Indenture, if any, will be repaid with the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Notes; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation; and 181 ----- - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness, including obligations to trade creditors, of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors. The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Facility and the Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders of the Notes, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. For the financial year ended December 31, 2022, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Guarantors represented 99.5% of the Group Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in this Offering Memorandum and disregarding the EBITDA of any member of the Group that generates negative EBITDA). Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As of December 31, 2022, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had approximately EUR 15,000 of Indebtedness of Subsidiaries other than the Guarantors. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes. “Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. “EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11.00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date.

If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11.00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under any applicable law.

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with any written request, made to that Holder or the Holder on behalf of that beneficial owner in writing at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable, by the Payor or applicable withholding agent: (a) to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or (b) to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which, in the case of (a) or (b) (or both), is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation; (3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is permitted or required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

Each Holder entitled to any Additional Amounts shall cooperate with the Issuer and the Trustee in providing any information or documentation reasonably requested by the Issuer or the Trustee to confirm the identity and/or tax status of such Holder and any affected beneficial owner to the extent such information is readily available to the Holder (to the extent necessary to establish such Holder’s entitlement to Additional Amounts) and to provide reasonable assistance to the Issuer or Trustee in determining the applicable withholding tax rate and the amount of Additional Amounts payable in respect thereof. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction in the minimum amount required by applicable laws and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s reasonable efforts, such tax receipts are not obtained, certified copies of other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary, without further inquiry, investigation, independent verification or liability of any kind. Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption price or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to, any Notes or any Note Guarantee (other than in each case, (A) in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this issuance of Notes or (B) to the extent that such stamp, issue, registration court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes or similar charges or levies becomes payable upon a voluntary registration made by the Holder if such registration is not required by any applicable law or not necessary to enforce the rights or obligations of any Holder in relation to the Notes, any Guarantees, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto) and limited solely in the case of any such Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded from the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by any of clauses (1) through (3) or clauses (5) through (10) above (or any combination thereof). The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. 200 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of a series of Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or a portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with an agent appointed for such purpose an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer. A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Note from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence 201 ----- of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Revolving Facility. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In respect of any four full fiscal quarter period, exchange rates used in relation to an item of Indebtedness may be, at the election of Issuer, (i) the weighted average exchange rates for that period, (ii) the exchange rate used in the relevant financial statements as of the last day of such period, (iii) the exchange rate as in effect on the date that Indebtedness was incurred or deemed incurred or (iv) the exchange rate on the Issue Date; provided _that, where applicable and at the election of the Issuer, any amount of Indebtedness will be stated so as to take into account the hedging effect of any currency hedging entered into in respect of or by reference to that Indebtedness. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of such security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. 229 ----- Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is given notice in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give written notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of written notice, that the Issuer is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Withholding Tax","For German tax residents (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control is located in Germany), interest payments will be subject to German withholding tax if the Notes are kept or administered (i) in a custodial account with a German branch of a German or non-German credit or financial services institution or a German securities institution or (ii) following the Migration (see “Corporate Structure” and “Certain Financing Arrangements”) – if no German branch of a German or non-German credit or financial services institution or a German securities institution is the Disbursing Agent – by the Issuer (each, a “Disbursing Agent,” auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%; with respect to the solidarity surcharge see “Partial _Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge”). For individual holders of the Notes who are subject to church tax, an electronic information system for church withholding tax purposes applies in relation to investment income, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the holders will be assessed for church tax. Further, church tax is not collected by way of withholding if the investment income forms part of income from trade business, selfemployment, agriculture and forestry, or letting and leasing. The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest”, _Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period_ provided that the Notes have been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If similar Notes kept or administered in the same custodial account were acquired at different points in time, the Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold first for the purposes of determining the capital gains. Where Notes are acquired and/or sold or redeemed in a currency other than Euro, the sales/redemption price and the acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the foreign exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and the acquisition date respectively with the result that any currency gains or losses are part of the capital gains. If interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e. without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposal are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the collection of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately. 275 ----- To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank, financial services or securities institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries (e.g., Switzerland or Andorra). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must, also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs. In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares in stock corporations and forward transactions). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take up to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene _Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross_ payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities. German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met. Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are held or administered in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen). In case of Definitive Registered Notes, payments might be also subject to German withholding tax if the Notes are presented for an over-the-counter-payment to a Disbursing Agent. Furthermore, payments made by a Guarantor resident in Germany or – following the Migration (see “Corporate _Structure and Certain Financing Arrangements”) – by the Issuer to a holder resident in a so-called “non-_ cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) may be subject to a tax deduction in Germany at a rate of 15% (plus solidarity surcharge) of the gross payment pursuant to the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb). However, according to recently introduced legislation no withholding tax will be levied if bearer notes are represented by a global note (Sammelurkunde), are held in collective safe custody with a central depositary, and are tradable on a recognized stock exchange. 276 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.55,TAXATION Certain German Tax Considerations,21.55.2,Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains,"_Tax Residents_ This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in Germany). Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible. The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “—Withholding _Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody_ abroad or of no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the actual gain, which exceeds 30% of the disposal proceeds), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Capital losses from the Notes held as private assets are tax-recognised irrespective of the holding period of the Notes. The losses may, however, not be used to offset other income like employment or business income but may only be offset against investment income subject to certain limitations. Losses not utilised in one year may be carried forward into subsequent years but may not be carried back into preceding years. According to new legislation, capital losses of private investors resulting from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or if the Notes expire worthless can only be offset against income derived from capital investments up to an amount of EUR 20,000.00 per annum (“Limitation on Loss Deduction”). Losses exceeding that threshold can be carried forward and set-off against income derived from capital investments up to an amount of EUR 20,000.00 per annum in subsequent years, subject to certain requirements. Given that the Limitation on Loss Deduction will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent (as defined above) holding the Notes in custody, holders suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare such losses in their income tax return. Where Notes form part of a trade or business or the income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not settle the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) applicable to the investor. If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method. _Non-Tax Residents_ This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not located in Germany). 277 ----- Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder, (ii) the holder of the Note is tax resident in a non-cooperative jurisdiction as determined pursuant to the German Act to Avert Tax Evasion and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb), payment is made by a Guarantor resident in Germany or – following the Migration (see “Corporate Structure and Certain _Financing Arrangements”) – the Issuer and the above mentioned exemption (as described under “—Withholding Tax” above) does not apply or (iii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income from_ the letting and leasing of certain German-situs real estate or income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (or other assets that are from a German civil law perspective treated as real estate), unless the Notes qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). In cases (i) and (iii) a tax regime similar to that explained above under “—Tax Residents” applies. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over the counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements, a holder who is not tax resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect. As each series of Notes may be subject to a different tax treatment due to the specific terms of such series of Notes, the following section only provides some general information on the possible tax treatment. Tax consequences that may arise if an investor combines certain series of Notes so that he or she derives a certain return are not discussed herein. The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate for certain investment income. However, prospective purchasers of the Notes should be aware that (i) the tax treatment of payments in respect of the Notes may be different (and in some cases significantly different) from that set out below, and (ii) tax laws and regulations and their application or interpretation by the relevant taxation authorities or courts may change from time to time (including the Flat Tax Regime described below which has submitted as unconstitutional by a fiscal court to the Federal Constitutional Court for review).

However, Estonia has meanwhile stated that it will not participate. The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.59,Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations,21.59.1,,"The following information is of a general nature only and is based on the laws presently in force in Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice. Prospective investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject. Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a withholding tax or a tax of a similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. _Withholding tax_ Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, and subject to the exception below, interest payments (including accrued but unpaid interest) and principal repayments made to non-residents of Luxembourg in the context of the holding, disposal, redemption or repurchase of the Notes which are not profit-sharing will not be subject to any Luxembourg withholding tax, and the Issuer is not under any obligation to pay any additional amounts as a consequences of any withholding. As regards Luxembourg resident individuals, the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, as amended, (the “Relibi Law”) provides for a 20% withholding tax (which is final when Luxembourg resident individuals are acting in the context of the management of their private wealth) on savings income, to the extent such income is paid or allocated by a Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of this law. Under the Relibi Law, payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Payments of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law will be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 20%. Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Relibi Law is assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. _Other Taxes and Duties_ Under current Luxembourg tax law and current administrative practice, it is not necessary that the Notes be notarized, filed, recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in Luxembourg, or that any stamp, transfer, capital, registration or similar tax be paid on or in relation to the execution and delivery of the Notes in accordance therewith or the performance of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, unless the documents relating to the Notes are (i) physically appended to any document that requires mandatory registration in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire), or (iii) registered on a voluntary basis. _VAT_ There is no Luxembourg value-added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the Notes or in respect of the payment of a redemption amount or principal under the Notes or the transfer of a Note; provided that Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain services rendered to the Issuer, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are rendered, or are deemed to be rendered, in Luxembourg and an exemption from value added tax does not apply with respect to such services. 279 ----- _Net Wealth tax_ Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on holders of the Notes unless: (i) Such corporate holder of Notes is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for the purpose of the relevant provisions and with the exception of the following entities that are net wealth tax exempt, being (i) undertakings for collective investment (UCITS) within the meaning of the law of December 17, 2010 as amended, (ii) investment company in risk capital (SICAR) within the meaning of the law dated June 15, 2004, as amended, (iii) securitization entities within the meaning of the law dated March 22, 2004 as amended, (iv) specialized investment funds (SIF) within the meaning of the law of February 13, 2007, as amended, (v) private wealth management companies (SPF) within the meaning of the law dated May 11, 2007 as amended and (vi) reserved alternative investment funds (RAIF) within the meaning of the law dated July 23, 2016, as amended; or (ii) The relevant Note is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg; However, a securitization company subject to the amended law of March 22, 2004 and a company subject to the amended law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles, are as from January 1, 2016, subject to a minimum net wealth tax, as well as, RAIF subject to the law of July 23, 2016, as amended, provided it is foreseen in the incorporation documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and that (ii) article 48 of the aforementioned law of July 23, 2016, as amended applies. The Relibi Law has abrogated the net wealth tax for Luxembourg resident individuals. _Taxation of the Noteholders_ A holder of Notes who derives income from such Note or who realizes a gain on the disposal or redemption thereof will not be subject to Luxembourg taxation on such income or capital gains realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes (subject to the application of the Relibi Law) unless: (i) Such holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for Luxembourg tax purposes (or for the purposes of the relevant provisions); or (ii) Such income or gain is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg. (iii) Except if, such holder is a corporate holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 on SPF, as amended, or by the law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended, or by the law of February 13, 2007 on specialized investment funds, as amended, or by the law of July 23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds (provided it is not foreseen in the incorporation documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and that (ii) article 48 of the aforementioned law of July 23, 2016 applies). A corporate Luxembourg resident holder of Notes must include any interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, as well as any gain realised on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. A corporate holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 on SPF, as amended, or by the law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended, or by the law of February 13, 2007 on specialized investment funds, as amended, or by the law of July 23, 2016, as amended, on reserved alternative investment funds (provided it is not foreseen in the incorporation documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and that (ii) article 48 of the aforementioned law of July 23, 2016, as amended, applies) is exempt from income tax in Luxembourg and thus income derived from the Notes, as well as gains realized thereon, are not subject to Luxembourg income taxes. A non-resident corporate holder of Notes or an individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent establishment or permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or to whom such Notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any gains realised upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes. 280 ----- A Luxembourg resident individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income tax at progressive rates in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes, except if (i) withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the Relibi Law, or (ii) the Luxembourg resident individual holder of the Notes has opted for the application of a 20% tax in full discharge of income tax in accordance with the Relibi Law, which applies if a payment of interest has been made or ascribed by a paying agent established in a EU Member State (other than Luxembourg), or in a Member State of the European Economic Area (other than a EU Member State). A gain realised by a Luxembourg resident individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, upon the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took place more than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion of such gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax, except if tax has been levied on such interest in accordance with the Relibi Law. A Luxembourg resident individual holder of Notes acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking must include this interest in its taxable basis. If applicable, the tax levied in accordance with the Relibi Law will be credited against his/her final tax liability. _Common Reporting Standard_ The OECD has developed a new global standard for the annual automatic exchange of financial information between tax authorities (the “CRS”). The CRS has been implemented in Luxembourg via the law dated December 18, 2015 concerning the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts and tax matters and implementing EU Directive 2014/107/EU and amending EU Directive 2011/16/EU (the “CRS Law”). In addition, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement (“Multilateral",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.60,Agreement”) to automatically exchange information under the CRS.,21.60.1,,"The CRS requires specified financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which may include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due diligence procedures. A jurisdiction that has signed the Multilateral Agreement may provide this information to other jurisdictions that have signed the Multilateral Agreement. Consequently, holders of Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to any financial institutions through which the payments on the Notes are made. Each prospective investor and each holder of Notes should consult its own tax advisors regarding the requirements under CRS with respect to its own situation as well as the determination of its tax residence.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.61,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.61.1,,"The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations related to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of Notes. This discussion is limited to U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) except for the discussion of Additional Notes (as defined below) and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities or currencies, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities or arrangements and investors in such entities, holders of Existing Notes redeemed in connection with this offering, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle”, “hedge”, “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax accounting 281 ----- rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., with respect to a particular series of the Notes, the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes of such series is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause such series of Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and such series of Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders would be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity, regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of a Note of such series, and to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income in a manner different than that described below.

If a U.S. holder is subject to withholding taxes, such U.S. holder should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of relief from withholding or a refund of any withheld taxes under the U.S.-Luxembourg tax treaty. A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time.

Accordingly, U.S. holders of Floating Rate Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders of Floating Rate Notes generally will include OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The amount of OID with respect to a Floating Rate Note includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Floating Rate Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Floating Rate Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Floating Rate Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Floating Rate Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Floating Rate Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity”, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable 283 ----- to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Floating Rate Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued unpaid OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Floating Rate Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Floating Rate Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. For the purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Floating Rate Notes as of the issue date. OID on Floating Rate Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of _Stated Interest.”_ A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Floating Rate Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Floating Rate Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Floating Rate Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Floating Rate Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). Certain Treasury Regulations that apply to non-U.S. income taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 restrict the availability of any such credit based on the nature of the withholding tax imposed by the non-U.S. jurisdiction. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability of any such tax imposed by Luxembourg. If a refund of any tax withheld is available under any applicable income tax treaty, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (and will not be eligible for the deduction against U.S. federal taxable income).

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder, increased, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, by OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to the Note, if any, translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the Notes are considered to be traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. 284 ----- If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. If the Notes are considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, in the case of a Floating Rate Note, OID, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount”, as applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of an Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, in the case of a Floating Rate Note accrued OID) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

On 3 April 2020, the Swiss Federal Council published draft legislation and opened a consultation procedure regarding the reform of the Swiss withholding tax regime. The draft legislation, if enacted in its current form, would replace the current debtor-based regime applicable to interest payments with a paying agent-based regime for Swiss withholding tax. In general terms, the proposed paying agent-based regime would (i) subject all interest 287 ----- payments made through paying agents in Switzerland to individuals resident in Switzerland to Swiss withholding tax and (ii) exempt from Swiss withholding tax interest payments to all other persons, including to Swissdomiciled legal entities and foreign investors (other than for indirect interest payments via foreign and domestic collective investments vehicles). However, the results of the consultation, which ended on 10 July 2020, were controversial. Consequently, on 15 April 2021, the Swiss Federal Council submitted new draft legislation on the reform of the Swiss withholding tax system providing for the abolition of Swiss withholding tax on interest payments on bonds for submission to the Swiss Parliament, which legislation was accepted by the Swiss Parliament on 17 December 2021. The proposed legislation has been rejected in a referendum held on 25 September 2022. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a new paying agent-based regime were nevertheless to be enacted as contemplated by the draft legislation published on 3 April 2020 and were to result in the deduction or withholding of Swiss withholding tax on any payment in respect of a Note by any person in Switzerland other than the Issuer, the holder of such Note would not be entitled to any additional amounts with respect to such Note as a result of such deduction or withholding.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of notes by a Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Plan. 290 ----- In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers). Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of a Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Each purchaser and transferee of a Note that is, or is acting on behalf of, an ERISA Plan, will be further deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Transaction Parties has provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person investing the assets of the ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied as a primary basis in connection with its decision to invest in the Notes, and they are not otherwise undertaking to act as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or Plan Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA Plan’s acquisition of the Notes and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the investment in the Notes. The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation, administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any Transaction Party or any of their respective representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan. 291 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this offering of the Notes and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that appear on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may change the prices at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the offering may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries or (subject to certain exceptions) affiliates that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement until the date falling 60 days after the date of the final offering memorandum without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to certain persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important _Information” and “Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors”, “Notice to Certain European Investors” and “Notice to Residents of Canada.”_ Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Luxembourg, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Canada and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the 292 ----- offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to _Prospective U.S. Investors”, “Notice to Certain European Investors” and “Notice to Residents of Canada.”_ The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Securities Official List of the LuxSE, however, the Issuer cannot assure you that the listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which _case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be six business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ 6”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the following four business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—There may not _be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may cease at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial 293 ----- Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and lending and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are lenders or act as agent under our New Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement or are Cash Management Providers under our Cash Management Facilities and may enter into hedging arrangements with us in connection with the Transactions, and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Moreover, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hold Existing Notes and/or act as lenders under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Upon redemption of the Existing Notes and repayment of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, such Initial Purchasers or their affiliates will receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours (including the Notes) or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. 294 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,Germany,23.1.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence according to German law; - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of noncompliance with such requirement, (i) the defendant does not invoke such noncompliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the proceedings; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment does not contradict any such judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law; - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment is final under U.S. federal or state law. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a 301 ----- German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

We have been advised by our Finnish counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland. Courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system. As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation of actual losses and damages as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented lies, with certain rare exceptions, with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is limited, and a party seeking to obtain such documents is required to be able to specify such documents with relative precision. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of 302 ----- the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the U.S. court is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law; - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules or, at least, the court order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court); - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi _luxembourgeoise)._ Please note that Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may change: additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions may not be verified by Luxembourg courts in the future. Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no statutory prohibition. We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such law was not made bona fide, or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law would be contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg public policy or public order rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in Euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into Euro.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
643_4,Final Offerings 2023.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.4,Switzerland,23.4.1,,"We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in Switzerland or the applicability of U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court. The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceeding set forth in particular by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische _Zivilprozessordnung) and the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of_ the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), which include, amongst others: - The U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective; 303 ----- - The judgment being final and non-appealable under U.S. federal or state law, or no ordinary legal remedy being available against such judgment; - The defendant having had the chance to defend itself against any unduly or untimely served complaint except for a defendant that unconditionally consented to the original proceeding before the respective court; - The original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of Swiss civil procedure law, in particular the right to be heard and the possibility to properly defend the relevant case; - The matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter (Verfahren) between the same parties pending before a Swiss court, provided such Swiss matter between the same parties was pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings; and - The enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot, however, assure you that any attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings in the sense of Article 6 of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über _das internationale Privatrecht). In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might_ be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Furthermore, it is not certain that a Swiss court, if substantive proceedings were commenced in Switzerland, would apply U.S. federal or state laws. The applicable law will be determined in particular in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), which may limit the right of the parties to choose the applicable law. As an example, notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the parties to an agreement, a court of Switzerland or other authority will not apply a provisions of foreign law if and to the extent that this would, in the court’s or authority’s view, lead to a result violating Swiss public policy (schweizerischer ordre public) or similar general principles. Moreover, a court of Switzerland or other authority will apply, notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the parties, any provisions of Swiss law (and, subject to further conditions, of another foreign law) which in the court’s or authority’s view imperatively demand application in view of their specific purpose (lois d’application immédiate). Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. For example, with respect to the production of evidence, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under Swiss law. Instead, a Swiss court would decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties and the related burden of proof. Judicial documents may not be served directly from abroad on a person in Switzerland (see Switzerland’s reservation to the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial or Extra Judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters concluded on November 15, 1965) and service must be effective by way of judicial assistance. Furthermore, under Swiss law, any amount denominated in a foreign currency and ordered to be paid pursuant to a final judgment will be enforced by Swiss debt collection authorities and must be converted into Swiss Francs. 304 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union (the “Member State”) (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The “center of main interests” is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the center of main interests of a company or legal person is presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). If the “center of main interests” of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. 305 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such establishment or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective Member State’s law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. 306 ----- Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest.

In the event of an insolvency of the certain Guarantors under the laws of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the certain Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung _von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for_ coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” 307 ----- (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.” Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve (12) months (positive Fortführungsprognose). Under the Act on the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate Crisis Effects (Gesetz zur _vorübergehenden Anpassung sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtlicher Vorschriften zur Abmilderung von Krisenfolgen) (the “SanInsKG”), the forecast period relevant for the over-indebtedness test was reduced to four_ (4) months until December 31, 2023. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of over-indebtedness at the latest six (6) weeks after over-indebtedness, occurred. Under the SanInsKG, the six-week period following the occurrence of over-indebtedness was extended to a period of eight (8) weeks until December 31, 2023. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes, may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of imminent illiquidity. The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that, inter alia, the debtor has enclosed a detailed and coherent self-administration plan (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) to the petition for the debtor-in-possession status and no circumstances are known which indicate that key aspects of the self-administration planning are based on inaccurate facts. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the 308 ----- insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste _Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and_ amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also being as unsecured insolvency claim). From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any of the Guarantors or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the assets of such Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management such Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of such Guarantor’s or any of its relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and - claims against such Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This will likely also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency 309 ----- proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus value added tax (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured insolvency creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige _Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the_ unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated _Claims.”_ While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of a Guarantor’s or any of its relevant subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of such Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances— be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer or issuance to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During the respective period granted by the court to prepare the insolvency plan, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. 310 ----- Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a Guarantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). To the extent such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the Notes or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the Notes, as applicable, would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes, as applicable, without preference in insolvency proceedings. Against this background, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that compellingly suggest such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled, if such act was taken (i) during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that compellingly suggest such detrimental effect); - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the 311 ----- intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder, for repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party”, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge”. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the CoVID-19 Pandemic (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden Aussetzung der _Insolvenzantragspflicht und zur Begrenzung der Organhaftung bei einer durch die COVID-19-Pandemie bedingten Insolvenz) (the “COVInsAG”), however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and_ shareholder loans under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a certain time during the COVID19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing was granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of thirdparty financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure the repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to a loan. 312 ----- The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg). Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Notes Guarantees and any other security granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH incorporated or established in Germany. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all. The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co, KG to be incorporated into the relevant Notes Documents (as defined in “Description of the Notes”), in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows: “Auditor’s Determination” shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in paragraph (d) below. “Enforcement Notice” shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in paragraph (c) below. “German Guarantor” means any Guarantor incorporated in Germany as (x) a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung - GmbH) or (y) a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a limited liability company as general partner (a “German GmbH & Co.

KG Guarantor, its general partner to be less than its respective registered share capital (taking into account the adjustments set out in paragraph (b) above and the realisation duties set out in paragraph (e) below) (the “Management Determination”) and such confirmation is supported by a reasonably satisfactory calculation provided that the Trustee shall in any event be entitled to enforce the Note Guarantee for any amounts where such enforcement would, in accordance with the Management Determination, not cause the German Guarantor’s, or, where the Guarantor is a German GmbH & Co.

Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest. The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Notes. The holders on the other hand are creditors under the Notes. In order to allow the holders to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the holders’ claims under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Guarantor for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted. Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent. 317 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in cases in which a debtor faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), _i.e., that there is the imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months. 315 ----- A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under “—Insolvency.”). Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency.”). The core component of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan which can be submitted solely by the debtor will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain legal requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilisation order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilisation order can, among other things, restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilisation order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilisation order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its center of main interest in Germany would be the following: - The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review and/or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilisation order; - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and 316 ----- - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a crossclass cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court are recognized in any EU member state under the EU Insolvency Regulation since the German lawmaker decided to include public restructuring proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act in Exhibit A of said Regulation. In any other case (i.e., a “private” proceeding), recognition of a restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Furthermore, the initiation of restructuring proceedings is possible - in theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation - when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company restructuring. If there are no specific legal barriers to company restructuring and, consequently, the court approves the application and initiates restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint an administrator (selvittäjä). The administrator appointed by the court (among others) looks after the creditors’ interests in the restructuring proceedings, prepares an inventory of the company’s assets and debts and prepares a proposal for the restructuring programme. The court will often appoint a creditors committee to assist and supervise the administrator. Despite the initiation of the restructuring proceedings, the directors of the company continue to act on behalf of the company but their powers are somewhat limited. The administrator supervises the operation of the company’s business. After restructuring proceedings have been initiated, the debtor may not, without the consent of the administrator: (i) take new loans (except for such loans which are within the ordinary course of business and the amount and terms of which are not unusual); (ii) transfer the company or a part thereof or any of its assets which are required for its business purposes; (iii) grant rights to the assets covered under (ii) above (except in the ordinary course of business); (iv) transfer current assets other than in the ordinary course of business and with customary terms; (v) terminate agreements which are necessary for carrying on business; (vi) grant security for a third party’s debt (except within the ordinary course of business and provided that the risks involved are not unusual); (vii) take other actions, which are unusual or material; or (viii) petition for bankruptcy. During the restructuring proceedings, the creditors of the debtor company generally exercise their powers through the creditors committee. The creditors committee has a supervisory role and is not involved in the day-to-day management of the company. During the restructuring proceedings, the administrator has the duty to: (i) compile a list of the company’s assets, liabilities and other undertakings, as well as to draft a report of any factors likely to affect the financial status of the company; (ii) monitor the activities of the company; (iii) to the extent necessary, conduct an audit of the activities of the company prior to the commencement of the restructuring proceedings; 318 ----- (iv) initiate any proceedings for the reversal of transactions entered into by the debtor; (v) prepare a draft restructuring program; and (vi) manage the restructuring proceedings pursuant to the Finnish Company Restructuring Act (Laki yrityksen _saneerauksesta)._ The administrator has a duty to perform his functions with regard to the interests of the creditors as a whole as well as with regard to the interests of the company. The administrator has a general duty of care and shall act fairly and honorably whilst in office. All existing debts and claims against the company are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The suspension as a main rule prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the restructuring debts (although debts arising after filing for company restructuring may be both repaid and enforced) and the seizure of assets. Restructuring debt, by definition, refers to all debt that has arisen prior to filing for restructuring, irrespective of when this debt falls due. The suspensions are in force until a restructuring program has been confirmed by the district court or the proceedings have been dismissed. Once the company restructuring program has been confirmed by the court, the company may pay the restructuring debts only in accordance with the program. All agreements entered into by the debtor remain in force and may not be terminated by a creditor, with certain exceptions. The administrator has the right to end certain agreements upon initiation of the restructuring proceedings such as lease agreements, credit-lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of the activities of the debtor and employment relationships. Creditors with equal ranking have equal standing in the arrangements of the restructuring debts within the restructuring program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Company Restructuring Act (Laki _yrityksen saneerauksesta), the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the_ restructuring program: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reduce the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt. Consequently, the restructuring procedure could result in holders of the Notes receiving a right to recover considerably less than they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the Notes Guarantee. It is to be noted, however, that the restructuring may not lead to a worse outcome for the creditors than the bankruptcy of the debtor. Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest to assets that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, insofar as the value of the security at the commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority, i.e., the amount of the creditor’s claim exceeding the value of the security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, will constitute unsecured debt and may, thus be subject to the measures described above. Regarding floating charges (yrityskiinnitys), only 50% of the value of the charged assets will be considered as secured debt. The administrator determines the value of the security. The part of the debt for which the value of the security is insufficient is considered unsecured debt, and may thus be restructured as unsecured debt (e.g., haircut). Should the security be deemed worthless or the standing of the creditor sufficiently junior in relation to other creditors with the same security, the debt may be even considered unsecured in its entirety. The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; or (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security. Payments on a secured debt shall be determined so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed one-half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the remaining credit period, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs. 319 ----- Restructuring of both unsecured and secured debt may take place only to the extent deemed necessary for the success of the restructuring proceedings. Bondholders are primarily each regarded as individual creditors to the debtor. The bondholders may, however, appoint a trustee to represent the bondholder collectively in relation to the debtor and the administrator. _Early Company Restructuring_ Early company restructuring can be initiated if the debtor is facing insolvency. The threat of insolvency must be concrete and foreseeable, but it does not need to be acute in a way as required in connection with regular company restructuring. In early restructuring it is not necessary to appoint an administrator albeit one would usually be appointed. The aim for early restructuring proceedings is to be faster than regular proceedings. Early restructuring proceedings have fewer prerequisites and impediments for initiation and continuation to ensure that viable companies can take preventive restructuring measures more easily. The early restructuring proceedings may not be initiated or must be terminated when: (i) the debtor is insolvent; (ii) it is likely that the debtor's assets are insufficient to cover the costs of the proceedings and no one has agreed to bear these costs; (iii) it is likely that the debtor will not be able to pay off debts arising after the opening of proceedings; or (iv) the bookkeeping of the debtor is substantially insufficient or deficient. In addition to the above, the main differences between the regular and early restructuring proceedings relate, among other things, to moratoria and the approval of the restructuring program without the acceptance of majority in all groups of creditors. Other than that, there are no material differences in relation to the restructuring program and how the program is approved in the early and regular proceedings. In the early proceedings, a general moratorium shall be imposed unless it is likely that a moratorium will not be necessary. However, a general moratorium shall not be imposed, if the debtor so requests. If a general moratorium is imposed, it is in force for three months, and can be extended to a maximum of 12 months. The court may also on application impose a temporary moratorium before the actual proceedings are initiated. The temporary moratorium can be in force for the maximum of three months. The duration of the temporary moratorium is taken into account when calculating the aforementioned total maximum of 12 months. Upon the expiration of the maximum period, the early restructuring proceedings should be completed, but if that is not the case it is possible to commence regular proceedings or if the company is insolvent, apply for bankruptcy.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

If the application is approved, an estate administrator (pesänhoitaja) (or several estate administrators) of the bankruptcy estate will be appointed by the court. Bankruptcy covers all liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the proceeds received therefrom in payment of the creditors’ claims. In order to achieve the objective of bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors. The creditors are represented through the creditor’s meeting, and a creditors’ committee may be appointed by the court. The bankruptcy estate may (exceptionally) continue with the company’s business operations, and the disposal of property will be realized as soon as reasonably possible. As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must lodge a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a “letter of lodgement”), by delivering it to the estate administrator no later than the deadline set by the estate administrator. The obligation to lodge a claim binds even secured creditors. Failure to lodge a claim may lead to the expiration of the debt. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of and within a time limit set by the estate administrator, provide the information on receivables and collateral that should be provided in a letter of lodgement. A creditor who holds a floating charge over the assets of the debtor as security of a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other 320 ----- debtor shall lodge the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (Konkurssilaki). If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, a value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate at the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a letter of lodgement. Similar creditors have an equal right to payment from the funds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion to the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. The Act on the Ranking of Claims (Laki velkojien _maksunsaantijärjestyksestä) determines the order in which debts are settled. The following creditors have_ precedence over unsecured creditors to receive disbursement from the estate: (i) secured creditors and holders of retention rights have priority to the proceeds relating to the relevant asset; (ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, creditors with claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceeding; and (iii) creditors with claims that are secured by a floating charge will receive prior to other claims a disbursement of 50% of the net proceeds of the charged assets (after the claims of creditors with a better priority position have been satisfied). The rights of the above-mentioned preferential creditors may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Notes. Bankruptcy of a Finnish Notes Guarantor could result in holders of the Notes recovering considerably less than they would have otherwise been entitled to recover under the Notes Guarantee. Further, it should be noted that debt incurred after the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, such as debt the estate has committed to, is prioritized and effectively reduce disbursable funds, and security with higher priority naturally affects the value of the security of the secured creditor with a lower priority. The Finnish Act on the Ranking of Claims specifies which debt is ranked with the lowest priority. Such debt may be, for example, any interest accrued after the commencement of the bankruptcy, capital loans, or bonds issued with a lower priority in relation to other indebtedness by the debtor. In practice, there rarely remain disbursable funds to even partially cover claims with the lowest priority. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds. However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a fixed charge over movable or immovable property may exercise their right to enforce such collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale for a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission. _Effect of bankruptcy on the bankruptcy debtor’s contracts_ As such, the debtor’s contracts are not automatically terminated upon the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Contract clauses by which contracts are immediately terminated upon bankruptcy are generally considered null and void, and are thus unenforceable. Pursuant to the Finnish Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy estate is generally entitled to become party to any contracts of the debtor by notifying the creditor of this within a reasonable time. As noted above, debt arisen from such a contract entered into by the bankruptcy estate is prioritized over bankruptcy debts. If a bankruptcy estate is willing to become party to a contract, the law entitles a creditor to request acceptable collateral from the bankruptcy estate to secure the performance of the contract. Should the bankruptcy estate be unwilling or unable to provide such collateral to the creditor, the creditor is entitled to terminate the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

According to the Finnish Company Restructuring Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code (Ulosottokaari), the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in restructuring and enforcement proceedings. The bankruptcy estate administrator, the restructuring administrator and certain creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, restructuring or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. 321 ----- Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of other creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty of the transaction knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or of the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in paragraph (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are assumed to have had knowledge of the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through foreclosure; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Payment received by a creditor through foreclosure effected by the relevant authority later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years (in case of recovery with respect to payment of debt between closely related parties made later than two years, but before three months from when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority, the recovery may be rejected if it is shown that debtor was not insolvent nor became insolvent due to the payment)) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years (in case of recovery with respect to granting security between closely related parties made later than two years, but before three months from when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority, the recovery may be rejected if it is shown that debtor was not insolvent nor became insolvent due to the granting of security)) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit. When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the bankruptcy estate or the debtor. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that has been paid for the property. If the funds have been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the party that paid the funds knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation for the estate to return the funds. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the recovered property. Accordingly, the validity of the Notes Guarantee or any payment made thereunder may be challenged under the Recovery Act and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. If the granting of a Notes Guarantee or a payment thereunder is successfully challenged under the Recovery Act, then the granting of such a Notes Guarantee could be nullified or the payment recovered. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of a Notes Guarantee, and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to a Notes Guarantee could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes, i.e. the holders of Notes may be ordered to return any proceeds received pursuant to a Notes Guarantee. 322 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Pursuant to such limitation, the beneficiaries of the Notes Guarantee agree to enforce the guarantee against any Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish Guarantor. Certain significant limitations to a company’s ability to grant guarantees are included in Sections 1 and 10 of Chapter 13 of the Finnish Companies Act regulating corporate benefit, unlawful distribution of funds and prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a Finnish limited liability company, such as a Finnish Guarantor, is prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or security for the purpose of a third party acquiring shares in such company or its parent companies. Further, the Finnish Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be granted (or any other transaction entered into) by a Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds, meaning unless doing so is in the company’s own commercial interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate benefit to the company, all relevant benefits and risks to the company are to be taken into account. In the context of the Notes Guarantee, among other things, other guarantees and security granted or to be granted by the Finnish Guarantors for the other financing arrangements of the Group in connection with, among other things, the New Revolving Credit Facility, are to be taken into consideration. The actual scope of the Notes Guarantee by a Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to corporate benefit, unlawful distribution of assets and/or financial assistance, as applied to the Notes Guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed. The Indenture will expressly provide substantially as follows: Notwithstanding any other provisions of the applicable Indenture to the contrary, the obligations of any Finnish Guarantor under the applicable Indenture shall be limited to the extent they would constitute (i) unlawful distribution of company’s assets within the meaning of Chapter 13, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act or (ii) prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Chapter 13, Section 10 of the Finnish Companies Act or (iii) be otherwise contrary to the mandatory provisions of the Finnish Companies Act.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type. Under Finnish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest (pledge) by the secured party and the grantor (pledgor), for any security (pledge) to be validly created, the grantor (pledgor) must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest (pledge). Any security interest (pledge) purported to be created under Finnish law over assets which the grantor (pledgor) may remain in possession of, retain exclusive or shared control over, entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interest (pledge) has been perfected. Such unperfected security interest (pledge) is vulnerable of being set aside in any insolvency proceedings affecting the grantor (pledgor) and may, potentially, be declared void. A security provided by an entity incorporated in Finland will be perfected as disclosed below. _Shares_ In the case of shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved in respect of a private limited liability company by (i) transferring the share certificate(s) (if issued) to the possession of the secured party and/or (ii) notifying the company of the pledge. 323 ----- _Claims in General_ Pledges can also be granted and perfected in receivables and other claims (including dividends). Security over receivables and claims (other than claims represented by negotiable instruments) is perfected by way of notification to the debtor of the underlying claim. There is no requirement as to the form for such notification. However, in order to obtain the intended result, the pledgor or the secured party should state that the claim has been pledged to the secured party and the notice must also effectively prohibit the underlying debtor from paying the pledgor. This means that the underlying debtor must be instructed to make payments to the pledgee (instead of the pledgor). Any claims/receivables pledged as Collateral to secure the Notes will not be perfected on the Issue Date, and will not be perfected until an enforcement event. In respect of negotiable promissory notes, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the promissory notes into the possession of the secured party. _Floating Charges and Real Estate Mortgages_ In the case of Finnish floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the duly issued and registered Finnish floating charge promissory notes into the possession of the secured party and registering the secured party or its representative as the holder of electronic real estate mortgage certificates in the register of real estate mortgages maintained by the National Land Survey of Finland (Maanmittauslaitos). The capital amounts of floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates do not necessarily correlate with the value of the assets covered by the relevant floating charges and real estate mortgages, and are often materially higher than the actual value of such assets. Therefore, the capital amount of floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates cannot be used as an indication of potential recovery in an enforcement scenario. Limitations on the recovery of the creditors with claims that are secured by a floating charge have been discussed above under Company Restructuring and Bankruptcy. _Certain Security granted by a Finnish Guarantor_ CABB Finland Oy as a Finnish Guarantor has granted a security by pledging its shares in CABB Oy (including related rights pertaining thereto) under a security agreement governed by Finnish law (the “Finnish Security",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The first, company restructuring (yrityssaneeraus) is split into early company restructuring (varhainen saneerausmenettely) and regular company restructuring. Regular company restructuring is intended to investigate whether the business has a reasonable chance to continue and, if so, to rehabilitate the company’s viable business, ensure its continued viability and make arrangements with creditors. The objective of the early company restructuring is to prevent potential insolvency. The second, bankruptcy (konkurssi), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In relation to the payment of dividends, CABB Oy whose shares, and dividends related thereto,",562.7.1,Enforcement of Security,"_General_ Enforcement can take place either outside of bankruptcy proceedings or during bankruptcy proceedings under certain criteria. Instead, in company restructuring proceedings, a moratorium applies and enforcement is generally not possible. The terms of the relevant security agreement regulate the enforcement, however, subject to constraints set by mandatory Finnish law. Complex, case specific legal issues often apply to enforcement. These aspects are discussed below on a general level only. _Enforcement outside of Bankruptcy Proceedings_ Depending on the type of security arrangement/asset under security, the secured creditor may, generally, enforce the security independently (such as security over shares and receivables) or through public enforcement authorities (such as floating charges and real estate mortgages). When enforcing a security, the secured creditor has a duty to take into account, in an appropriate way in the circumstances, the interests of the pledgor and those of other potential interested parties, such as any second lien pledgees or floating charge holders. In practice, this means, inter alia, that the secured creditor may not sell the secured assets for a price lower than fair market value in the then current circumstances. This duty of care is generally deemed to apply irrespective of the terms of the security agreement. 324 ----- When the secured creditor enforces security outside of bankruptcy proceedings and to the extent that the net proceeds exceed the creditor’s secured claim, the secured creditor must hold the excess proceeds for the account of any second lien pledgees, floating charge holders and/or the pledgor, as appropriate. _Enforcement during Bankruptcy Proceedings_ In a bankruptcy scenario where the secured creditor enforces the security independent from the concurrent bankruptcy proceedings (which is possible in respect of _e.g.,_ security over shares and receivables, but not for floating charges), the secured creditor will use the enforcement proceeds to satisfy its secured claim. The secured creditor shall then render to the bankruptcy administrator an account of the proceeds of the enforcement and transfer to the bankruptcy administrator the net proceeds from the enforcement that exceed the creditor’s secured claim. After bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated, there are four options available for the enforcement of a real estate mortgage: (i) Private (or public) sale by the administrator with the consent of the mortgagee(s). (ii) If the mortgagee(s) does not give its consent for the administrator to effect a private (or public) sale, the administrator may seek the court’s approval for the sale. (iii) Despite the bankruptcy proceedings, the mortgagee can proceed to seek a court order to allow the mortgagee to independently enforce the mortgage by arranging the sale of the underlying real property through public enforcement authorities (however, the administrator may impose an interim moratorium up to two months’ time period). (iv) After three years have passed since the commencement of the bankruptcy, public sale by the administrator without the consent of the mortgagee(s) or a court order. In a bankruptcy scenario where the bankruptcy administrator enforces the security, the bankruptcy administrator will distribute the enforcement proceeds to the secured creditor up to the amount of the creditor’s secured claim, whereas any excess proceeds will form a part of the assets of the estate (to be distributed to creditors). Irrespective of whether the enforcement in bankruptcy was carried out by the secured creditor independently or by the bankruptcy administrator, should the enforcement proceeds not suffice to satisfy the creditor’s secured claim, the outstanding balance of the secured creditor’s claim will constitute an ordinary unsecured claim towards the bankruptcy estate and will rank pro rata with the claims of other unsecured creditors. _Enforcement during Company Restructuring Proceedings_ If company restructuring proceedings have been initiated against the pledgor, the pledgee can no longer enforce the pledge independently (nor accelerate the underlying loans against the pledgor) and any enforcement procedures already initiated (but not completed) will be discontinued. The prohibition to enforce the pledge is in force until the court has passed a decision to either accept or reject the restructuring program proposed by the administrator. In early proceedings, a general moratorium shall be imposed unless it is likely that a moratorium will not be necessary. However, a general moratorium shall not be imposed, if the debtor so requests. If imposed, it can be in place for a maximum of 12 months. The moratorium does not apply where the security in question qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Finnish Act on Financial Collateral (Rahoitusvakuuslaki) or where the security is situated within the territory of another Member State as provided for in Article 5(1) of the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings. If the restructuring program is accepted by the court, the enforcement of pledges is likely to be covered by the restructuring program. Should the proposed program be rejected, the most likely outcome is the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. _Security Granted in Favor of an Agent_ There is some uncertainty under Finnish law as to whether security can validly be granted in favor of an agent or trustee alone and not in favor of the relevant pledgees/secured parties. However, the Finnish Act on Bondholder Representatives (Laki joukkolainanhaltijoiden edustajasta) recognizes the concept of security agency as part of Finnish law. The pledgees/secured parties may be represented by an agent who can enter into the relevant security agreement for and on behalf of the pledgees/secured parties based on a power of attorney or a mandate of agency. 325 ----- It is generally considered under Finnish law that an irrevocable authorization and an irrevocable appointment of agent may nevertheless be revoked at any time by the principal. To address the aforesaid uncertainty about the enforceability of a pledge granted solely in favor of an agent or a trustee, the Finnish Security Agreement has been executed by the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. _Liquidation due to capital deficiency_ The Finnish Companies Act requires a company to give notification to the Finnish Patent and Registration Office (Patentti- ja rekisterihallitus) should its equity become negative, but does not include any provisions mandating the board of directors of a company to file for bankruptcy or restructuring or place the company into liquidation due to the financial standing of the company. However, the law includes provisions concerning the management’s liability for damages deliberately or negligently caused to the company, or due to violation of the duty of care. A director may therefore be de facto required to file the company for bankruptcy or restructuring proceedings or apply for liquidation, which may adversely affect the value of any securities or guarantees given by the company. Public limited companies are subject to certain additional requirements due to capital deficiency.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer which is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer, as an entity having its registered office and central administration (administration centrale) and centre of main interests (“COMI”), as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI in the jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office if its registered office has not moved to another member state within 3 months prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. As a result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the COMI of the Issuer is in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and consequently that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law. However, the determination of where the Issuer has its COMI is a question of fact, which may change from time to time. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is ascertainable by third parties. In that respect, the courts have to take a number of factors into consideration, such as: the place where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established. These factors may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. The point at which a company’s COMI is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be initiated against a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its COMI or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the COMI is located in a jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable): - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any of its creditors or by the courts _ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (“cessation des paiements”) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (“ébranlement de crédit”). The main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors (please see below for the applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005) and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the 326 ----- company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of managers’/ directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code; - controlled management proceedings (“gestion contrôlée”), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see below for the applicable provision of the",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The granting of any financial collateral governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005 must be capable of being evidenced in writing. However, additional steps are required to enforce security interests against third parties. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts will generally apply, in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over the assets subject to such security interests, the law of the place where such assets are situated (lex rei sitae or lex situs). As a consequence, Luxembourg law should apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, if any, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/ claims having debtors located in Luxembourg and/or governed by Luxembourg law, securities which are held through an account located (or deemed to be located) in Luxembourg and bearer securities physically held in Luxembourg. If certain assets are located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The creation, validity and enforcement of security interests such as pledges and transfers of ownership as security, granted on financial instruments and claims (in order to secure cash settlement and/or delivery of financial instruments) are governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005, a pledge (gage) is effected by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets. As the physical transfer of possession is not possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession (i.e., perfection) which is effected by mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the dispossession is validly realized by notifying the pledge to the issuer of such shares or by an acceptance of the pledge by the issuer of such shares who in turn will proceed to an entry of the pledge in the share register held by the issuer of such shares. A pledge granted over intercompany receivables is perfected once the relevant pledge agreement has been entered into by all parties thereto. However, in order for the debtor under the pledged receivables not to be able to validly liberate itself from its payment obligations thereunder by paying the pledgor instead of the pledgee, when the pledge agreement provides that such payment shall inure to the pledgee, the debtor of such receivables needs to be notified of or has to accept the pledge granted thereover. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. The above perfection steps and actions need to be undertaken by the grantor of the security interest and/or the Security Agent. If the relevant grantor or the Security Agent fails or is unable to take the necessary steps/actions required to take or perfect any of the above-mentioned security interests, such security interests will not have been created and/or perfected with respect to the claims arising under the Notes. Article 11 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 sets out the following enforcement methods, available upon the occurrence of the relevant enforcement event in respect of a pledge governed by the provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005: - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the market price of the pledged assets (if the pledged assets are admitted to trading on a trading venue); - assigning or causing the assignment of the pledged assets (i) by private sale in a commercially reasonable manner (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) on a trading venue on which the pledged assets are admitted to trading, or (iii) by way of a public auction; - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or 329 ----- - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Financial Collateral Law 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Luxembourg law governed security interests may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located outside of Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, unless “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to pledge agreements, if any, does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgor through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled in priority to the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees and/or security interests, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been appointed for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged guarantees and/or security interests must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object. The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company”, which is a translation of the French “intérêt social”, an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior”. Whereas previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit is subjective. In a group context, the interest of the companies of the group taken individually is not entirely eliminated. With respect to guarantors and/or security grantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Companies Law 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee and/or secure the indebtedness of another entity of the same group, it is generally held that within a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in granting upstream or cross-stream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee or security) to other group companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee or security, provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any event to all the factual circumstances of the matter): (i) such guarantee or security must be given for the purpose of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group, (ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee or security must not be without consideration and such commitment must not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group companies, and (iii) such guarantee or security granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the committing company. Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee or a security interest on a group level is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of corporate interest for one or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate benefit is of particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915. The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (personal and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Company Law 1915, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, _e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In 330 ----- addition, it cannot be excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915 will be held null and void. The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment is required to be made by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the above developments, the guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres) and certain intra-group liabilities), which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indentures or guarantee agreements. The registration of the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) with the Administration de l’Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA_ in Luxembourg may be required in the case that the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) are either (i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d’un notaire) or (iii) registered on a voluntary basis. In such case, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable in respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require (when these are presented before them) that the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German, except if the relevant documents are drafted in English.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for secured creditors (please see below for the applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005); or - in addition to these proceedings, the ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of (i) a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (“sursis de paiement”) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (“liquidation judiciaire”) or (ii) the Luxembourg public prosecutor to initiate a procedure for administrative dissolution without liquidation (“dissolution administrative sans liquidation”) against a Luxembourg company. Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code (Code de Commerce) or of the Luxembourg law of August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Companies Law 1915”). The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of the Issuer or a a Luxembourg guarantor, if any, in respect of the relevant Notes will, in the event of liquidation following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum social salary); - employees’ contributions to social security; - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - employer’s contribution to social security; - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; and - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for distribution to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). Favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments) pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Article 20 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties, are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the pre-bankruptcy preference period (période suspecte) against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud). Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law 2005. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save in the case of fraud). 327 ----- Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement. _Impact of insolvency proceedings on transactions_ During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors (except for secured creditors benifitting from a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 (please see below for the applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005)) to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the Issuer’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of default may still be served. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer during the suspect period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months plus ten days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg commercial code, specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg commercial code, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg commercial code and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intentto defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s or a Luxembourg guarantor’s (if any) business and assets and the Issuer’s or such Luxembourg guarantor’s respective obligations under the Notes. Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice, however, to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 as described above and article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation). 328 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy, subject to the rights of creditors and other parties in interest to object and seek relief from the bankruptcy court. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to: - the administration of a bankruptcy case, including (i) the imposition of the automatic stay, which immediately stays all litigation, as well as most enforcement and other actions against the debtors or property of the bankruptcy estate; (ii) provision of “adequate protection” to secured creditors to protect against diminution of value of their collateral; (iii) terms for the use, sale or lease of property; (iv) standards for obtaining post-petition credit; and (v) rules regarding the treatment of executory contracts and unexpired leases; - creditors and claims, including deadlines and requirements for filing proofs of claim, the priority and allowance of claims, and subordination of claims; and - creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and ability to bring turnover and avoidance actions, provisions relating to liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the filing of ancillary and other cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor’s assets by a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court and typically results in the immediate shutdown of the debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to continue to operate 331 ----- their business as a going concern while they reorganize their businesses and resolve their obligations to creditors (although a liquidation or sale under chapter 11 is also possible), in each case pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation, as applicable. Unlike in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case the debtor typically remains in possession of its assets and continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case (subject to the supervision of the bankruptcy court), with substantially the rights that a trustee would otherwise have. In addition, “liquidating” chapter 11 cases may be used as an alternative to a liquidation under chapter 7, particularly in an instance when the debtor seeks to maintain the “going-concern value” of its business and/or expects to sell all or substantially all of its assets free and clear of liens during the course of the bankruptcy case. Because bankruptcy proceedings are often fact specific and vary case-by-case, and because bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that could affect the Notes, and/or the guarantees and security is not contained herein. Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction. With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (e.g., assignments for the benefit of creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms), the effect on creditors in these proceedings are fact-specific, vary from state-to-state, and require an examination of both statutory and common law, the details of which also are not described herein. To the extent more information is required, potential investors in the Notes should consult an insolvency professional familiar with the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the applicable state insolvency laws.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, creditors are prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from commencing or prosecuting any litigation against the debtors or the property of the bankruptcy estate that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding and from taking any action to obtain possession of or exercise control over property of the bankruptcy estate. The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, including the lack of “adequate protection” of an interest in property of the debtor, but parties may object to any creditor request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court could deny such a request. The automatic stay ordinarily does not bar suits against non-debtor guarantors or co-obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a liquidation case under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to the circumstances. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate protection for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures. Likewise, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code generally does not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees with respect to unsecured or undersecured claims. Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a plan of reorganization unless the debtor fails to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan within the first 180 days of the case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 332 ----- months after a chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other parties such as secured creditors would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans. In consideration of the automatic stay, the lack of precise definition of the term “adequate protection”, the exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of the bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its rights; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed or confirmed; or - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of any collateral through the provision of “adequate protection.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts and circumstances, authorize the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens. In other words, it is possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11 filing.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the adjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type with other claims or interests that are substantially similar. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan, but still entitled to some distribution under the plan, may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interests that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if more than one-half in number of claims holders and two-thirds in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, it may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so long as the plan (i) does not discriminate unfairly and (ii) is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.

Generally, a U.S. Obligor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than all of its assets, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. There can be, however, no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency determinations and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. If a court were to find that the issuance of a guarantee or security interest was a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the guarantee or security interest, subordinate the payment obligations under such guarantee or security agreement to the existing and future indebtedness of the Obligor or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the guarantee or security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance occurred, there may be no payment made in respect of the affected guarantees. In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a U.S. bankruptcy case with respect to fraudulent transfers and fraudulent conveyances, claims in respect of liens or obligations evidenced by guarantees may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests, the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company or which is entered into within a certain period prior to insolvency or bankruptcy, may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the trustee or insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of a Guarantor may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that the applicable court may determine the guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event that any guarantees are deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The granting of a guarantee, indemnity, security or other benefit as well as any other undertaking contained in any agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set-off or subrogation rights or the subordination of intra-group claims, granted by the Swiss Guarantor for the benefit of the Swiss Guarantor’s direct and indirect parent or sister companies (so-called “Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations”) are subject to certain 334 ----- restrictions and risk being held invalid or partially invalid under Swiss corporate law. Therefore, the Indenture and/or any other relevant document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will contain certain limitation language in relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations of the Swiss Guarantor, in order to enable the Swiss Guarantor to grant guarantees securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating such restrictions under Swiss law and to protect management from personal liability; such “limitation language” is standard market practice for, amongst others, indentures, guarantees and security documents in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Switzerland in the form of a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or Swiss limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). Limitations on the enforcement of any guarantee and/or indemnity granted by the Swiss Guarantor apply in relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations. The ability of the Swiss Guarantor to assume Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations is restricted under Swiss law insofar as such Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations must be within the corporate purpose and interests of the Swiss Guarantor and must not result in a repayment of the share capital (Einlagerückgewähr/Kapitalrückzahlung), a violation of legally protected reserves (gesetzlich _geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) or other non-permitted_ distribution of assets to shareholders, board members or other persons close to the Swiss Guarantor. In light of the foregoing, the Indenture and/or any other relevant document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will limit the amount of claims under any Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations assumed by the Swiss Guarantor to its freely distributable equity at the time of enforcement. Freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum amount that the Swiss Guarantor is permitted to distribute to its shareholders as a dividend payment under Swiss law at such time. Presently, the freely distributable equity capital is equal to the balance sheet profits, and any reserves available for distribution (minus, without double counting, any freely disposable equity that has to be blocked for any loans granted by the Swiss Guarantor to a direct or indirect parent company of the Swiss Guarantor or a direct or indirect subsidiary of any parent company pursuant to applicable Swiss corporate law and applicable accounting standards) at the time or times at which payment in relation to Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations is requested. In addition, the enforcement of any Guarantee granted by the Swiss Guarantor with respect to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations may give rise to Swiss withholding taxes (of up to 35% at present rates, subject to applicable double taxation treaties) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of such Guarantee is regarded as a deemed dividend distribution. Under Swiss law, any obligation of the Swiss Guarantor to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax may not be valid and, thus, may prejudice the enforceability of anything to the contrary contained above under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” or in the Indenture or any other documentation related to the Notes. In addition, any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax in connection with any Guarantee granted by the Swiss Guarantor with respect to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations would in any case be limited by the amount of the freely distributable equity of the Swiss Guarantor. Further, the granting and/or enforcement of any Guarantee with respect to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. The Indenture and/or any other relevant documents to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will expressly provide substantially as follows: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, the obligations of any Guarantor incorporated in Switzerland (a “Swiss Guarantor”) and the rights of any holder of a Note, the trustee or the Security Agent under this Indenture or the Notes are subject to the following limitations: (i) if and to the extent that a Swiss Guarantor is liable under this article or any other provision of this Indenture or of the Notes for obligations other than its own obligations or obligations of one of its direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries and that complying with such obligations would constitute a repayment of capital (Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich _geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) by such Swiss_ Guarantor (the “Swiss Restricted Obligations”), the aggregate liability of such Swiss Guarantor for Swiss Restricted Obligations shall be limited to maximum amount of the Swiss Guarantor’s freely disposable shareholder equity (the “Swiss Available Amount”) at the time such Swiss Guarantor is required to perform the relevant obligation under the Indenture or the Notes, provided that this is a requirement under applicable law at that time and further provided that such limitation shall not free such Swiss Guarantor from its obligation in excess thereof, but merely postpone the performance date therefore until such times as performance is again permitted notwithstanding such limitation. This Swiss Available Amount of freely disposable shareholder equity shall be determined in accordance with Swiss law and applicable Swiss accounting principles, and, if and to the extent required by applicable Swiss 335 ----- law, shall be confirmed by the auditors of the Swiss Guarantor on the basis of an interim audited balance sheet as of that time; (ii) immediately after having been requested to perform Swiss Restricted Obligations under the Indenture or the Notes, such Swiss Guarantor shall: (A) perform the Swiss Restricted Obligations which are not affected by the above limitations; and (B) in respect of any remainder, if and to the extent requested by the Security Agent or required under applicable Swiss law then in force, provide the Security Agent with an interim balance sheet audited by the statutory auditors of such Swiss Guarantor setting out the Swiss Available Amount and, immediately thereafter, pay the Swiss Available Amount (less, if required, any Swiss Federal Withholding Tax) to the Security Agent to the extent not already covered by the preceding sub-paragraph (ii)(A); (iii) in respect of Swiss Restricted Obligations, each Swiss Guarantor shall: (A) if and to the extent required by applicable law in force at the relevant time: (1) subject to any applicable double tax treaties, deduct tax levied pursuant to the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax Act ((Bundesgesetz über die Verrechnungssteuer vom 13 _Oktober 1965, SR 642.21) together with the related ordinances, regulations and_ guidelines, all as amended and applicable from time to time (the “Swiss Federal",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests over assets located in Switzerland. The insolvency laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA, Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Under these rules, claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of a bankruptcy proceeding (Konkursverfahren) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets and liabilities of a Swiss debtor. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge must follow a special enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have agreed that general debt enforcement proceedings and/or a private liquidation are permissible. However, if bankruptcy is declared while such a special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no longer permitted. The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in force. Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from a Swiss insolvency law point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Under Swiss insolvency laws, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex _officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings._ Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate law in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency laws in the event that the debtor has obviously and permanently stopped to pay its debts as and when they fall due or has acted fraudulently, or is attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also initiate insolvency proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally, pursuant to Swiss corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be assessed pursuant to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations and on the basis of a balance sheet to be drawn up immediately upon the debtor’s board of directors having serious reason to believe that the debtor is over-indebted (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s assets and (ii)—to the extent there is still a going concern scenario—based upon the going concern value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued at liquidation values nor at going concern values, the debtor’s board of directors has to notify the bankruptcy court, provided that (i) creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the over-indebtedness and (ii) there is no serious ground to admit that the over-indebtedness can be cured in time, but in any event at the latest within ninety days since the interim balance sheets have been drawn up (Article 725b Swiss Code of Obligations). However, as soon as the debtor loses the going concern assumption for accounting purposes, going concern values become irrelevant and over-indebtedness is assessed solely based on liquidation values. While the criterion of over-indebtedness is based on a balance sheet test (rather than a liquidity test), it is important to note that a debtor’s inability to pay its debts as and when they fall due will cause the debtor to lose the going concern assumption for accounting purposes and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation values. This, in turn, will typically result in over-indebtedness. The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to file for bankruptcy at the latest within ninety days since the interim balance sheets have been drawn up and non-compliance with this obligation exposes the board of directors to both damage claims and (in extraordinary cases) sanctions under criminal law. The debtor’s board of directors need not file for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in an aggregate amount no lower than the amount of the debtor’s over indebtedness subordinate their claims against the claims of all other creditors, or (ii) if there is a substantiated likelihood for an informal (i.e., out of court) workout at the latest within ninety days since the interim balance sheets have been drawn up. Finally, the debtor’s auditors have the obligation to notify the competent court if the debtor’s board of directors has failed to file for insolvency despite the debtor being obviously over indebted. If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings it has to file an application for commencement of enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office (Betreibungsamt). With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located where the debtor is registered or resident. The debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is 337 ----- no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No reasons need to be given for the objection. The debt collection office notifies the creditor of the objection. For claims based on an enforceable judgment, the creditor can without any further delay file an application to lift this stay with the court (Rechtsöffnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an enforceable judgment, but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional lifting of such stay can be applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung). In the event the objection is set aside in these summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an action in ordinary court proceedings for a negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist (Aberkennungsklage). The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to continue the enforcement proceeding (Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent debt collection office delivers a continuation threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung) to the debtor. The insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the creditor’s rights. After 20 days from receipt of the threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung) the creditor may petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. The competent insolvency court decides upon the insolvency without any delay, provided that there are no reasons which would lead to a suspension of the insolvency court’s decision. In addition, the debtor has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the insolvency court. The insolvency court orders the continuation of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order to continue insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the insolvency proceedings themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the insolvency proceedings will be closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des _Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the insolvency office may request the insolvency court to_ resolve upon summary insolvency proceedings (summarisches Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary insolvency proceedings and the actual facts of the case are not complicated. Furthermore, in such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary insolvency proceedings. Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) provided that certain acts require the approval of the insolvency court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). The creditors’ committee has additional competences. Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not interest bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of insolvency, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon insolvency, interest ceases to accrue. Only secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such interests. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings in Switzerland. Swiss insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with, and subject to, the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such security interest is vested with the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. 338 ----- Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, such as a debtor’s employees. Certain privileges can further result for the Swiss government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) after the security interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in full. As an alternative solution to insolvency, the debtor (or, under certain circumstances, a creditor) may seek a composition with creditors (Nachlassverfahren) by applying to the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht) for a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) and submitting, besides other documents, a tentative reorganization plan. The court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium provisionally (provisorische _Stundung) for a maximum period of up to four months or not. With its decision the court appoints a commissioner_ provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). In case circumstances would justify it, the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht) may withhold a public announcement of the granting of the provisional moratorium, provided third party interests are well protected. In such case, (i) the creditors and other authorities will not be notified, (ii) debt collection proceedings may still be initiated or further pursued (unless challenged by the debtor) and (iii) a provisional commissioner (provisorischer Sachwalter) must be appointed in all circumstances. In case it is obvious that there are no chances for a successful reorganization of the company or a composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag), the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht), acting on its own motion, opens insolvency proceedings over the debtor. In case the moratorium has been granted provisionally (provisorische _Stundung) and in case during the period of the provisional moratorium a reorganization of the company or a_ composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a time before the provisional moratorium has expired, the court approves the moratorium definitely (definitive Stundung) and appoints a commissioner (Sachwalter). The court may, where deemed necessary, also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss) for the purpose of supervising the commissioner. The commissioner convokes a meeting of creditors (Gläubigerversammlung) which has to approve the draft composition agreement according to specific majority rules. The composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is subject to the approval of the composition court. The Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) provides for three different types of composition agreements: the ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag), the composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) and the composition agreement in insolvency proceedings (Nachlassvertrag im Konkurs). During a definitive moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending proceedings are stayed. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. In case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the settlement only for the amount of its claim not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). However, a debtor may, subject to consent by the commissioner (Sachwalter), terminate long-term agreements (Dauerschuldverhältnisse) (other than employment agreements) without notice (even if notice periods apply under the agreement as such), provided (i) the continuation of the long-term agreement (Dauerschuldverhältnis) would impede or at least seriously challenge the intended financial recovery and (ii) provided the counterparty to such long-term agreement (Dauerschuldverhältnis) is held harmless (it being understood that the respective claim would be a claim in the composition proceeding (Nachlassforderung)). Interest payments will be stopped for unsecured claims during the moratorium (unless otherwise explicitly provided in the composition agreement). The moratorium aims at facilitating a rehabilitation of the debtor under protection of the court or the conclusion of one of the above composition agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims. Privileged claims must be paid in full.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of Article 111 Swiss Code of Obligations are typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative. Other security interests (rights in rem) are enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security agreement. Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties to enforce the security interest either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off 339 ----- of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA), in which case the right of objection pursuant to Article 41 of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) (Einrede der Betreibung auf _Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security agreements. In such case, the parties also typically agree in_ advance that a private sale (Freihandverkauf) will be admissible. In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may acquire any or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In case of an assignment of claims for security purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured parties, collect all assigned claims. Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties by way of a private sale (Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case without having to initiate proceedings under the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA). After an insolvency has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar security rights are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Under Swiss law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes will not be party to the security documents relating to the collateral. In order for the holders of the Notes to benefit from “accessory” security interests and have a secured claim, the security documents and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by Swiss law will directly secure the parallel debt. However, the parallel debt concept has not been tested in court under Swiss law, and there is no certainty that it will be recognized and held valid and enforceable under Swiss law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In particular, a transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security interest and the payment of debt) that is detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors: - The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the transaction, who must in this case prove that such transaction was at arm’s length. - Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security interest for already existing claims, provided that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security interest, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any way other than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment of a debt not yet due.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other information The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” thereon. © 2023 KPMG Audit S.à r.l., a Luxembourg entity and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All rights reserved. R.C.S Luxembourg B 149133 ----- ###### Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Responsibilities of the réviseur d'entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ----- ###### — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

The amendments had no material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations: - Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37 _Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS_ 2018 – 2020. The amendments to IFRS 3 include an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards. Furthermore, an additional provision was added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer must apply the provisions from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when identifying assumed liabilities within the scope of these standards. The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items produced while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognised with the associated costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not permissible. The amendments to IAS 37 specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 to contracts existing at the date when the amendments are first applied. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments is recognised as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity, as appropriate. The comparatives are not restated. The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and vice versa are to be included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities. Costs or fees paid to other third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 41 _Agriculture, and to the explanatory examples of IFRS 16 Leases._ The following IFRSs and their interpretations are not yet in force in 2022 but already issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They were reviewed and are explained below, CABB currently assumes that they will have no material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and does not plan to early adopt these amendments. - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current _or Non-current. The amendments pertain to a limited modification of the relevant criteria used to_ classify liabilities as current or noncurrent. They specify that the classification of liabilities as current depends on the company’s rights as of the balance sheet date to postpone settlement of the liability by a minimum of 12 months after the end of the reporting period. If such rights exist, the liability is classified as noncurrent. Otherwise, it is classified as current. Classification is irrespective of management’s expectations and of possible events after the balance sheet date. It also specifies that settlement of a liability is defined as the repayment of liability using cash, other economic resources or a company’s own equity instruments. The IASB issued a further amendment on July 15, 2020 whereby the date of initial application of the amendment on classification of liabilities will be postponed by one year to January 1, 2024. ----- - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including amendments to IFRS 17. On March 18, 2020, the IASB decided to postpone the date on which IFRS 17 will enter into force to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The amendment was issued on June 25, 2020. IFRS 17 was issued on May 18, 2017, provides requirements on recognition, remeasurement and presentation of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard and will replace IFRS 4. - Amendments to IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements_ and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Making Materiality Judgements. The amendments to IAS 1 _Disclosure of Accounting Policies requires that only material accounting policies shall be disclosed in the notes in the future. Accounting policy information is material if it relates to material transactions or events and there is a reason to consider materiality (for example a change in accounting policy). The guidelines in IFRS Practice Statement 2 were accordingly adjusted. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023. - Amendments to IAS 8 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._ The amendments issued on February 12, 2021, clarify how entities can better distinguish between changes resulting from changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. For this purpose, accounting estimates are defined as “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023. - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments require companies to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. - Amendments to IFRS 10 IAS 28 _Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its _Associate or Joint Venture. The IASB has postponed the mandatory effective date of its 2014_ Amendments indefinitely. - Amendments to IFRS 16 _Leases. The amendments impact how a seller-lessee accounts for [variable lease payments that arise in a sale-and-leaseback transaction. The amendments introduce](https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/news/2022/09/iasb-issues-narrow-scope-amendments-to-requirements-for-sale-and-leaseback-transactions/) a new accounting model for variable payments and will require seller-lessees to reassess and potentially restate sale-and-leaseback transactions entered into since 2019. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2024. We are currently reviewing the impact of the application of those standards on the consolidated financial statements, which are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s reporting. With effect from January 1, 2021, we applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The amendments had no material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations: - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 _Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures,_ IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and IFRS 16 Leases (issued on August 27, 2020). Under the detailed rules of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, modifying a financial contract can require the recognition of a significant gain or loss in the income statement. The amendments from phase 2 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (issued on August 27, 2020) introduce a practical expedient, if a change results directly from IBOR reform and occurs on an ‘economically equivalent’ basis. In these cases, changes will be accounted for by updating the effective interest rate. A similar practical expedient applies under IFRS 16 _Leases_ for lessees when accounting for lease modifications required by IBOOR reform. The amendments also allow a series of exemptions from the regular, strict rules around hedge accounting. For example, a company will not need to discontinue existing hedging relationships because of changes to hedge documentation required solely by IBOR reform. Therefore, when a hedged risk changes due to the benchmark reform, a company may update the hedge documentation to reflect the new benchmark rate and the hedge may be able to continue without interruption. New disclosure requirements apply providing information about (1) the nature and extent of risks to which the company is exposed arising from financial instruments subject to IBOR reform and how it manages those risks; can (2) the company’s progress in completing its transition to alternative benchmark rates and how it is managing that transition. The amendments apply retrospectively from January 1, 2021. - Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases Relating to Coronavirus-related Rent Concessions beyond June _30, 2021, issued by the Board in May 2020. The 2020 amendments introduced an optional practical_ expedient that simplifies how a lessee accounts for rent concessions that are a direct consequence of COVID-19. Under that practical expedient, a lessee is not required to assess whether eligible rent concessions are lease modifications, instead accounting for them in accordance with other applicable guidance. The Board extended the availability of the practical expedient by 12 months on March 31, 2021 and permits lessees to apply it to rent concessions for which any reduction in lease payments affects only payments originally due on or before June 30, 2022. The 2021 amendments are applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it being recognised in opening retained earnings. The disclosure requirements of Paragraph 28(f) of IAS _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors do not apply on initial application._ - Amendments to IFRS 4 _Insurance Contracts – Extensions of Temporary Exemption from _Application of IFRS 9. The amendments to IFRS 4 issued on June 25, 2020 are aligned with the_ two-year postponement of the date on which IFRS 17 will come into force to reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. They include an analogue extension of the temporary exemption period for certain insurance companies from application of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, requiring these insurance companies to apply IFRS 9 for the first time in fiscal years beginning on or after, January 1, 2023. The following IFRSs and their interpretations are not yet in force in 2021 but already issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They were reviewed and are explained below, CABB ----- currently assumes that they will have no material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and does not plan to early adopt these amendments. - Amendments to IFRS 3 _Business Combinations,_ IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37 _Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS_ 2018 – 2020. These amendments were issued on May 14, 2020 and will come into force on January 1, 2022. The amendments to IFRS include an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards. Furthermore, an additional provision will be added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer must apply the provisions from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when identifying assumed liabilities within the scope of these standards. The content of the accounting rules for business combinations will not change. The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items produced while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognised with the associated costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not permissible. The amendments to IAS 37 specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022 to contracts existing at the date when the amendments are first applied. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments is recognised as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity, as appropriate. The comparatives are not restated. The Group has determined that all contracts existing at December 31, 2021 will be completed before the amendments become effective. The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and vice versa are to be included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities. Costs or fees paid to other third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 41 _Agriculture, and to the explanatory examples of IFRS 16 Leases._ - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities as Current _or Non-current. The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 on January 23, 2020. The amendments_ pertain to a limited modification of the relevant criteria used to classify liabilities as current or noncurrent. They specify that the classification of liabilities as current depends on the company’s rights as of the balance sheet date to postpone settlement of the liability by a minimum of 12 months after the end of the reporting period. If such rights exist, the liability is classified as noncurrent. Otherwise, it is classified as current. Classification is irrespective of management’s expectations and of possible events after the balance sheet date. It also specifies that settlement of a liability is defined as the repayment of liability using cash, other economic resources or a company’s own equity instruments. The IASB issued a further amendment on July 15, 2020 whereby the date of initial application of the amendment on classification of liabilities will be postponed by one year to January 1, 2023. - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including amendments to IFRS 17. On March 18, 2020, the IASB decided to postpone the date on which IFRS 17 will enter into force to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The amendment was issued on June 25, 2020. IFRS 17 was issued on May 18, 2017, provides requirements on recognition, remeasurement and presentation of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard and will replace IFRS 4. - Amendments to IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements_ and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Making Materiality Judgements. The amendments were issued on February 12, 2021. The amendments to IAS 1 _Disclosure of Accounting Policies_ requires that only material accounting policies shall be disclosed in the notes in the future. Accounting policy information is material if it relates to material transactions or events and there is a reason to consider materiality (for example ----- a change in accounting policy). The guidelines in IFRS Practice Statement 2 were accordingly adjusted. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023. - Amendments to IAS 8 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._ The amendments issued on February 12, 2021, clarify how entities can better distinguish between changes resulting from changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. For this purpose, accounting estimates are defined as “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023. - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. The amendments issued on May 7, 2021 require companies to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. - Amendments to IFRS 10 IAS 28 _Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its _Associate or Joint Venture. The IASB has postponed the mandatory effective date of its 2014_ Amendments indefinitely. We are currently evaluating the impact of the application of those standards according to the required application date in the financial years 2022 to 2023 on the consolidated financial statements. With effect from January 1, 2020, we applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union. The amendments had no material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations: These amendments and clarifications did not have significant impacts on CABB Group’s consolidated financial statements. - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards. (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020). The amendments update references to and quotes from the Conceptual Framework. The revised Conceptual Framework issued on March 29, 2018 replaces the previous Conceptual Framework from 2010. The main changes primarily relate to the definition, recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities, as well as the differentiation between income and expense and other comprehensive income. (An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 29, 2019). - Amendments to IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements_ and IAS 8 _Accounting Policies, _Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after_ January 1, 2020). The amendments provide a uniform and more precise definition of the materiality of information provided in the financial statements, together with accompanying examples. In this connection, the definitions in the Conceptual Framework, IAS 1, IAS 8 and the IFRS Practice Statement 2 (Making Materiality Judgements) were harmonised. (An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 29, 2019). - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 on September 26, 2019, completing Phase 1 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform project. The amendments relate to existing uncertainties with regards to the IBOR reform. According to original hedge accounting policies, pending adjustments to benchmark interest rates would, in many cases, result in an end to hedging relationships. The ----- amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 ensure the continuity of hedging relationships despite existing uncertainties regarding interest rate benchmarks, for example by defining that the highly probable requirement is always considered to be met. In connection with the amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39, disclosure requirements were added to IFRS 7. The amendments were endorsed by the European Union on January 15, 2020. - Amendment to IFRS 3 _Business Combinations._ The amendments issued on October 22, 2018 specify that a business is a set of activities and assets with at least one input and one substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Outputs are defined as the provision of goods and services to customers. The existing reference to cost reduction as a characteristic of business combinations was removed. In addition, the new provisions also contain an optional concentration test designed to simplify identification of a business. The modified definition was endorsed by the European Union on April 21, 2020. - Amendment to IFRS 16 _Leases Relating to Coronavirus-related Rent Concessions._ On May 28, 2020, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16 aimed at simplifying lessees’ accounting of concessions, such as deferments of rent payment or deductions in rent prices, which are granted as a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic. If certain requirements are met, lessees may forego the determination of whether a coronavirus-related rent concession presents a modification of the lease agreement. These amendments were endorsed by the European Union on October 9, 2020. The following IFRSs and their interpretations are not yet in force in 2020 but already endorsed by the European Union. They were reviewed and are explained below, CABB currently assumes that they will have no material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements and does not plan to early adopt these amendments. - Amendments to IFRS 4 _Insurance Contracts – Extensions of Temporary Exemption from _Application of IFRS 9. The amendments to IFRS 4 issued on June 25, 2020 are aligned with the_ two-year postponement of the date on which IFRS 17 will come into force to reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. They include an analogue extension of the temporary exemption period for certain insurance companies from application of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, requiring these insurance companies to apply IFRS 9 for the first time in fiscal years beginning on or after, January 1, 2023. The amendments were endorsed by the European Union on December 15, 2020 and are to be applied for the first time on or after January 1, 2021. - Amendments to IFRS 9 _Financial Instruments,_ IAS 39 _Financial Instruments: Recognition and _Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and IFRS_ 16 Leases – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2. The amendments from phase 2 of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, which were issued on August 27, 2020, are intended to simplify accounting during the IBOR reform. They supplement the requirements from the first phase and generally deal with the replacement from the first phase and generally deal with the replacement of one benchmark interest rate with another. With respect to the presentation of financial instruments, it was clarified that in the case of changes to contractual cash flows, the carrying amount of financial instruments is not to be adjusted or derecognised. Under certain conditions, the effective interest rate can be changed to reflect the change in the alternative interest rate benchmark. Similarly, with respect to the accounting treatment of hedging transactions, under certain conditions, it is not necessary to end a hedge accounting relationship designated for hedge accounting purposes due to IFRS 16 and IFRS 4 as well as additional IFRS 7 disclosure requirements were adopted the amendments were endorsed by the European Union on January 13, 2021 and will come into force for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The following IFRSs and interpretations were issued by the IASB, which are still subject to the endorsement of the endorsement by the Europeand Union, their application is not not yet mandatory. These amendments are unlikely to have a material impact on the reporting of CABB. CABB does not plan on early adoption of these amendments. ----- - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification of Liabilities. The IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 on January 23, 2020. The amendments pertain to a limited modification of the relevant criteria used to classify liabilities as current or noncurrent. They specify that the classification of liabilities as current depends on the company’s rights as of the balance sheet date to postpone settlement of the liability by a minimum of 12 months after the end of the reporting period. If such rights exist, the liability is classified as noncurrent. Otherwise, it is classified as current. Classification is irrespective of management’s expectations and of possible events after the balance sheet date. It also specifies that settlement of a liability is defined as the repayment of liability using cash, other economic resources or a company’s own equity instruments. The IASB issued a further amendment on July 15, 2020 whereby the date of initial application of the amendment on classification of liabilities will be postponed by one year to January 1, 2023 – subject to endorsement by the European Union. - Amendments to IFRS 3 _Business Combinations,_ IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 37 _Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as well as Annual Improvements to IFRS_ 2018 – 2020. These amendments were issued on May 14, 2020 and – subject to the endorsement of the European Union – will come into force on January 1, 2022. The amendments to IFRS include an update of the reference of the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards. Furthermore, an additional provision will be added to IFRS 3 stating that an acquirer must apply the provisions from IAS 37 and IFRIC 21 rather than the Conceptual Framework when identifying assumed liabilities within the scope of these standards. The content of the accounting rules for business combinations will not change. The amendments to IAS 16 specify that income received by a company through the sale of items produced while the asset is being brought to its location and into working order must be recognised with the associated costs in profit or loss. Including these items in the cost of the asset is not permissible. The amendments to IAS 37 pertain to the definition of the cost a company includes when determining if a contract will cause losses. Accordingly, settlement costs are all costs that would not be uncured without the contract (incremental cost) as well as other costs directly attributable to the contract. The annual improvements to IFRS 2018 – 2020 pertain to amendments to IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, whereby only such costs and fees which are paid to the lender by the company and vice versa are to be included in the “10% test” for the purpose of derecognition of financial liabilities. Costs or fees paid to other third parties may not to be included. Moreover, they pertain to minor amendments to IFRS 1 First-Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, IAS 41 _Agriculture, and to the explanatory examples of IFRS 16 Leases._ - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including amendments to IFRS 17. On March 18, 2020, the IASB decided to postpone the date on which IFRS 17 will enter into force to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The amendment was issued on June 25, 2020. It has not yet been endorsed by the European Union. IFRS 17 was issued on May 18, 2017 and provides requirements on recognition, remeasurement and presentation of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4. - Amendments to IAS 1 _Presentation of Financial Statements_ and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Making Materiality Judgements. The amendments were issued on February 12, 2021. The amendments to IAS 1 _Disclosure of Accounting Policies_ requires that only material accounting policies shall be disclosed in the notes in the future. Accounting policy information is material if it relates to material transactions or events and there is a reason to consider materiality (for example a change in accounting policy). The guidelines in IFRS Practice Statement 2 were accordingly adjusted. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023 – subject to endorsement by the European Union. ----- - Amendments to IAS 8 _Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors._ The amendments issued on February 12, 2021, clarify how entities can better distinguish between changes resulting from changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. For this purpose, accounting estimates are defined as “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. The amendments are to be applied in the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023 – subject to endorsement by the European Union. We are currently evaluating the impact of the application of those standards according to the required application date in the financial years 2022 to 2023 on the consolidated financial statements. Early adoption of the standards before endorsement by the European Union is not planned.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In the financial year 2022, Russia and Ukraine accounted for less than1 % of our Group Revenues. Group sales and earnings, as well as the financial position and results of operations were only marginally impacted by the war and its direct consequences in 2022. We did not register any increase in past-due receivables in Russia or Ukraine. Based on a risk analysis conducted at the level of individual customers, no impairments were recognised for expected losses. Energy supply and global supply chains may also continue to be disrupted as a result of COVID-19 and the war. Energy costs rose by around 58.9% (€ 24.3 million) year over year in 2022. They accounted for 11.6% of the total cost of goods sold in the financial year 2022. CABB’s direct exposure with regards to potential gas shortages is minimal. We’ve realigned our processes and are furthermore advancing the implementation of programs to save energy. At the same time, we are expanding our supplier network and building up additional inventories where appropriate. The higher inflation caused by the developments mentioned above and the associated rise in interest rates had, among others, an impact on the measurement of pension provisions (see note (26)) and financial expenses (see Note (17).

Control is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them. CABB primarily generates income from the sale of goods. Within the product group “Exclusives and Specialities”, revenue from specific customer contracts is recognised over time. In these cases CABB’s performance obligation consists in the creation of an asset without an alternative use to CABB and CABB has an enforceable right to payment for the performance obligation completed to date. These contractually enforcable rights are recognised and disclosed within ‘Accounts receivable, trade’ if already shipped, or otherwise within ‘Contract assets’. The valuation of the related revenues is performed by using the output method. The produced chemicals are valued by the agreed sales price and any other parts allocated based on the overall amount of chemicals to be produced under the respective contracts. Certain customer contracts within the product group ‘Exclusives and Specialties’ provide for nonrefundable capital expenditure fees, paid by the customer at the beginning or during the project. These advance payments are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in proportion to the performance used by the customer during the contract period (output method). The outstanding performance obligation is disclosed in the balance sheet at each reporting date. It is possible that the performance obligation at a given point in time is in a contract asset or a contract liability position. If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognised at a specific point in time. Determination of the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the goods occurs in the context of an overall assessment of the circumstances which considers the existence of a present claim to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer of risks and rewards takes into account the underlying terms of delivery (especially Incoterms) and is of particular practical significance. According to these principles, sales revenue from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery. Payment terms depend on the customer’s creditworhhiness and range from cash in advance to longer payment terms.",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straightline-method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: (a) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; (b) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and (d) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. From 1 January 2021, where the basis for determining future lease payments changes as required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rate that reflects the change to an alternative benchmark interest rate. Leases in which CABB is a lessee mainly relate to transportation and technical equipment as well as land and buildings. The corresponding right-of-use assets are included within ‘Property, plant and equipment’ or ‘Other intangible assets’ and the lease liabilities within ‘Other (non-current/ current) financial liabilities’ in the consolidated statement of financial position. ----- The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for low-value assets and recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease contracts in which CABB acts as a lessor are exclusively operating leases, as these contracts do foresee the transfer of substantially all risks and rewards of utilising the underlying assets to the lessee. The leased assets continue to be capitalised, and the lease payments received are recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, when CABB becomes a party of a financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash equivalents, and derivatives with positive fair values. Financial assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when CABB becomes a party to a financial instrument. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. The amount at which a financial asset is initially recognised comprises its fair value and in most cases the transaction costs. The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow condition (the “solely payments of principal and interest” criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset portfolios. Based on these two criteria, the following measurement categories are applicable: _Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash_ flow are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition established in IFRS 9. At CABB, derivatives are allocated to this measurement category, for example. CABB does not generally exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of financial instruments not to be measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances. _Financial assets measured at amortised cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to_ cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow conditions in IFRS 9, to the extent that the asset is held with the intention of collection the expected contractual cash flows over its term. At CABB, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivables that are not eligible for factoring, as well as miscellaneous assets and certain securities. A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not a FVTPL, transactions costs that are directly attributable to is acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured amortised costs using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss. Initial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value, which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement effects are recognized in income using the effective interest method. ----- Impairments are recognised for expected credit losses in both initial and subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence of any default event for financial assets measured at amortised costs and contract assets. If the counterparty is considered as having defaulted, an individual valuation allowance is generally recognised for the financial assets measured at amortised cost. In addition, a write-off is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering the financial asset in its entirety of a proportion hereof. The extend of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period, impairments are generally only recognised for the 12-month expected credit losses. By contrast, under the simplified approach for determining expected credit losses permitted by IFRS 9, impairments for receivables such as trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable concerned. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due. At CABB, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal information and external rating information on the respective counterparts. A significant increase in the counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The significance of the increase in the credit risk is not reviewed for trade accounts receivable. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have increased significantly. Regional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and expectations are taken into account when assessing the need for a valuation allowance as part of the calculation of expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances. In addition, CABB uses internal and external ratings and the assessments of credit insurers, when available. Individual valuation allowances are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks. Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortised costs, are likewise considered when calculating valuation allowances. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an immaterial extent. The valuation allowances for receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognised in excess of the amount of the deductible. A decrease in valuation allowances due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after the valuation allowance is recorded in profit or loss. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets measured at amortised cost are credit impaired. This is the case if one or more events that have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the debtor, a breach of contract such a default or being more than 90 days past due; if it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. Loss allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For individual customers, the Group has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 180 days past due based on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets. The Group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. Financial assets are classified based on the group`s business model for managing the financial assets and on their contractual cash flow characteristics. The carrying amounts of the trade receivables are assumed to equal their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Due to the short maturity of these receivables, the transaction price represents their fair value. Trade receivables sold under the securitisation programme, as well as the related liabilities are recognized to the extent of the credit risk retained (continuing involvement). _Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include all assets with_ contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9, ----- to the extent that the asset is not just held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows of its term, but also generating cash flows from the sale of a portfolio. At CABB the eligible trade receivables for factoring fulfil these criteria. Assets measured at fair valued through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value, which usually corresponds to the nominal value of the securities, allocated to its category at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the time value are recognised in other comprehensive income and the delta reclassified to the statement of income when the asset is disposed of. Impairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortised cost and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The following measurement categories are used for financial liabilities: _Financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided_ these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent measurement is recognised in profit or loss at amortised cost using the effective interest method. At CABB, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. _Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities._ These are likewise measured at the value of initial recognition. The latter also represents the measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently measure financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or has expired. Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument. If IFRS requires separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host contract and measured at fair value. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: ###### • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived form prices) ###### • Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) CABB uses the following valuation technique for determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities: Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves. This valuation technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and relies as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. ----- The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. There were no transfers between the different levels of fair value hierarchies in the financial reporting periods ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The deferred taxes on income are accrued on the basis of the current or substantively enacted local tax rate expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the forseeable future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. These assets are tested once a year for indications of impairments. If there are any such indications, estimates of the expected future cash flows from the utilisation and potential disposal of these assets are made for assessing the impairment. The actual cash flows may differ appreciably from the discounted future cash flows which are based on these estimates.

The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension fund (Pensionskasse – PK) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company, Ilmarinen, Finland. The calculations of the liabilities recognised regarding these facilities are based on statistical and actuarial calculations of the actuaries. In particular, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation depends on assumptions such as the discount rate and the pension growth rate used for calculating the present value of the future pension obligations. Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of the future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by the Group also use statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions. The discount rate for the actuarial calcuations of the German and Finnish defined-benefit obligations was determined by applying the Mercer Pension Yield Curve Approach (MYC).

These contractually enforcable rights are recognised and disclosed within ‘Accounts receivable, trade’ if already shipped, or otherwise within ‘Contract assets’. The valuation of the related revenues is performed by using the output method. The produced chemicals are valued by the agreed sales price and any other parts allocated based on the overall amount of chemicals to be produced under the respective contracts. Certain customer contracts within the product group ‘Exclusives and Specialties’ provide for nonrefundable capital expenditure fees, paid by the customer at the beginning or during the project. These advance payments are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in proportion to the performance used by the customer during the contract period (output method). The outstanding ----- performance obligation is disclosed in the balance sheet at each reporting date. It is possible that the performance obligation at a given point in time is in a contract asset or a contract liability position. The weighted-average expected remaining term of the contract liabilities as of December 31, 2022 is 2.16 years (2021: 2.0 years). If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognised at a specific point in time, generally upon delivery.

The goodwill impairment test is performed on the basis of cash-generating units (CGUs) by comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying amount. Consistent with the internal management and reporting structure, the following three cash generating units have been identified: (i) CDMO – Europe, (ii) CDMO – North America, (iii) Non - CDMO. The CGUs reflect the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The existing goodwill was allocated to the CGUs in accordance with the purchase price allocation in 2014 for the CGU CDMO – Europe and the CGU Non – CDMO resp. 2019 for the CGU CDMO – North America. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is calculated based on the fair value less costs to sell approach. The underlying cash flow projections are based on past experiences, current results and on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. Market assumptions, such as the development of the overall economy and the market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific information sources. The required discounting of cash flows for impairment testing is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital rate after tax, which is determined using the capital asset pricing model. It comprises a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective industry-specific peer group. The fair value measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair value. The financial projections were approved by management and consist of a detailed planning period of five years. The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2022. The recoverable amount of all CGU’s exceed their carrying amounts as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2021.

In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension plan (Pensionskasse der CABB AG) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd., Ilmarinen (Finland). The pension fund of CABB AG is organised as an independent registered trust (registrierte Stiftung) and maintains a shift insurance plan and a regular pension plan. According to the deed of foundation, the trust has the purpose to provide benefits to retired employees of CABB AG in the form of pension payments for life and in case of disability or death within the framework of the Occupational Pension Act (Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge BVG). Alternatively, the employee can request a lump-sum payment of his accrued capital. The level of ----- benefits provided depends in general on employees’ length of service and their salary for respective service years. According to the pension plan rules, the pension benefits are financed by contributions of the employees, the employer and the fund. Art. 32 of the pension plan determines that in case the means of the fund are insufficient to meet the defined contributions by the fund, those contributions have to be made by the employer. Contributions to the Swiss pension fund are expected to remain stable in the short to medium term as payments are based on fixed percentages of pensionable benefits. If there is a funding shortfall, the Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) can implement measures including: changing benefits, lowering the returns credited to employees and changing the conversion rate. If the measures are not sufficient to improve the funding level, and as a last resort, the fund can ask the employer and employees to make additional contributions to close the gap. CABB AG would then have to bear at least half of any extra payments. Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans under IAS 19, as although contribution levels are in fact “fixed”, there is a potential risk of extra payments in future. Basis for the investment of plan assets is the investment regulation of the foundation dated December 10, 2013. This regulation ensures the compliance with Occupational Pensions Act (BVG) and best possible return within acceptable risk profile. Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) and Investment Commission (Anlagekommission) define the long term investment structure as well as objectives and benchmarks for the investments. Only bonds with solid credit risk rating (at least ""BBB-"") are selected for investments. At least 50% of all bond investments are made in bonds with rating of ""AA-"" and higher. Investment guidance is reviewed on an annual basis. All persons involved in investment decisions for plan assets or otherwise employed by the pension fund are subject to confidentiality obligations and have to follow the ASIP (Swiss pension fund association) Charter. The defined benefit plans in Finland, Germany and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as: - **Interest risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition the decrease in interest rate will decrease interest expense; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plan assets. - **Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. - **Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition, defined benefit plans in Finland and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to the investment risk: Decrease in the fair value of plan assets can create a plan deficit. In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is calculated using the actuarial valuation method for current one-off premiums or in accordance with the projected unit credit method on the basis of specific parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligation to show the funded statuts of the obligation. The extent of the obligation as well as the plan assets are determined at regular intervals of not more than twelve months; in the case of all defined-benefit plans, they are calculated every year as of December 31. Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits. The following parameters have been used as the basis for determining the present value of the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 for the domestic and international companies: ----- Age- and gender-related fluctuation probabilities have been used. The average duration of the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 is 10.5 years (December 31, 2021: 13.6 years). The actuarial assumptions may differ from the actual results due to the change in market conditions and economic climate, higher or lower retirement rates, longer or shorter lives of insured parties and also other estimated factors. These differences can have an impact on the pension obligations recognised in future reporting periods. Amounts recognised in comprehensive income in respect of these defined benefit plans are as follows: CABB Group provides its employees post-employment defined benefit plans.

Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits. The following parameters have been used as the basis for determining the present value of the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 for the domestic and international companies: CABB Group provides its employees post-employment defined benefit plans. In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension plan (Pensionskasse der CABB AG) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd., Ilmarinen (Finland). The pension fund of CABB AG is organised as an independent registered trust (registrierte Stiftung) and maintains a shift insurance plan and a regular pension plan. According to the deed of foundation, ----- the trust has the purpose to provide benefits to retired employees of CABB AG in the form of pension payments for life and in case of disability or death within the framework of the Occupational Pension Act (Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge BVG). Alternatively, the employee can request a lump-sum payment of his accrued capital. The level of benefits provided depends in general on employees’ length of service and their salary for respective service years. According to the pension plan rules, the pension benefits are financed by contributions of the employees, the employer and the fund. Art. 32 of the pension plan determines that in case the means of the fund are insufficient to meet the defined contributions by the fund, those contributions have to be made by the employer. Contributions to the Swiss pension fund are expected to remain stable in the short to medium term as payments are based on fixed percentages of pensionable benefits. If there is a funding shortfall, the Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) can implement measures including: changing benefits, lowering the returns credited to employees and changing the conversion rate. If the measures are not sufficient to improve the funding level, and as a last resort, the fund can ask the employer and employees to make additional contributions to close the gap. CABB AG would then have to bear at least half of any extra payments. Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans under IAS 19R, as although contribution levels are in fact “fixed”, there is a potential risk of extra payments in future. Basis for the investment of plan assets is the investment regulation of the foundation dated December 10, 2013. This regulation ensures the compliance with Occupational Pensions Act (BVG) and best possible return within acceptable risk profile. Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) and Investment Commission (Anlagekommission) define the long term investment structure as well as objectives and benchmarks for the investments. Only bonds with solid credit risk rating (at least ""BBB-"") are selected for investments. At least 50% of all bond investments are made in bonds with rating of ""AA-"" and higher. Investment guidance is reviewed on an annual basis. All persons involved in investment decisions for plan assets or otherwise employed by the pension fund are subject to confidentiality obligations and have to follow the ASIP (Swiss pension fund association) Charter. The defined benefit plans in Finland, Germany and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as: - **Interest risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition the decrease in interest rate will decrease interest expense; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plan assets. - **Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. - **Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition, defined benefit plans in Finland and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to the investment risk: Decrease in the fair value of plan assets can create a plan deficit. In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is calculated using the actuarial valuation method for current one-off premiums or in accordance with the projected unit credit method on the basis of specific parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligation to show the funded statuts of the obligation. The extent of the obligation as well as the plan assets are determined at regular intervals of not more than twelve months; in the case of all defined-benefit plans, they are calculated every year as of December 31. ----- Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits. The following parameters have been used as the basis for determining the present value of the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 for domestic and international companies:",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

In 2022, additional employer contributions of kEUR 5,973 (2021: kEUR 5,230) were made into statutory pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans). Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant: - If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligaton would decrease by kEUR 9,458 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 14,341) (increase by kEUR 11,628; December 31, 2021: kEUR 15,955). - If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 8,918 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 13,080) (decrease by kEUR 7,092; December 31, 2021: kEUR 12,194). - If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 541 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 980) (decrease by kEUR 562, December 31, 2021: kEUR 955). The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.

The following valuation techniques have been used for determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities: - **Market comparison technique (i.e. Notes): financial instruments with standard terms and conditions which are traded on active markets are valuated based on broker quotes. Similar contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transations in similar instruments. - **Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives): financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives) are valuated considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves. - **Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte Carlo simulation. For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is calibrated such that the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (Bourse de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing model also considers the riskfree interest rate as another paramater. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.

They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). The value of the embedded derivatives is affected by the interest of the comparable market instrument on each potential exercise date and will rise if the relevant interest rate declines and vice versa. Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “at amortised cost” under IFRS 9 as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference date are approximately equivalent to the fair value. ----- Trade accounts receivable and other financial liabilities of the category “at fair value through other comprehensive income” under IFRS 9 represent the credit risk retained by the Group with regards to trade accounts receivable, which are sold under the securitisation programme (continuing involvement).

The Group’s overall risk management seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. In November 2019, the Group joined a factoring contract of one of its customers, in the course of which trade receivables due from a major customer are settled through a bank. Since June 2020, the Group sells without recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured entity under an asset-backed securitisation programme. The financing volume is committed to a maximum amount of kEUR 50,000 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 30,000). The structured entity is not controlled by CABB and therefore not consolidated by the Group. The special purpose entity obtains its funding primarily from capital markets through the issuance of commercial papers and has mandated the Group to service the receivables in return for an at arm’s-length fee. The structured entity has the contractual right to terminate this service agreement and may appoint as substitute servicer any other person. The Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a revolving basis at their nominal value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is presented as part of other financial receivables and represents the Group’s right to receive this amount once the trade receivables sold have been settled by the customers. To the extend to which the credit risk is retained by the Group (continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and corresponding other financial liabilities are recognised. The carrying amount of trade receivables transferred under the securitisation programme amounted to kEUR 32,970 as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 24,288), of which kEUR 32,175 have been derecognised (December 31, 2021: kEUR 23,662); and kEUR 9,270 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 3,325), representing the retained reserve, is presented as part of other current financial receivables. The carrying amount of trade receivables (classified as trade receivables) and the other financial liability resulting from the continuing involvement amounted to kEUR 795 as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: kEUR 626).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the « Responsibilities of “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other information The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the consolidated report including the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” thereon. © 2022 KPMG Luxembourg, Société anonyme, with registered office at 39, Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, registered with RCS Luxembourg under number B149133, and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by ----- ###### Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Responsibilities of the réviseur d'entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ----- ###### — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. — Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the “réviseur d'entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

A transaction in which a parent company contributes its ownership interests or the net assets of a wholly owned subsidiary to the capital reserves of another subsidiary, falls into the definition of a business combination under common control. A common-control transaction is similar to a business combination for the entity that receives the net assets or equity interests. However, as there is no change in control of the net assets from the perspective of the ultimate parent or the controlling shareholder level, such a transaction is not governed by IFRS 3 and there is no other specific guidance in the IFRSs. Hence, management needs to use judgement to develop an accounting policy, that provides relevant and reliable information in accordane with IAS 8. Interpretation of IFRSs adresses the accounting for common control transactions from the perspective of the entity that receives the net assets or equity interests and requires the receiving entity to recognise the assets and liabilities transferred either at their fair value or at their carrying amounts in the financial statements of the entity that transfers the net assets on the date of transfer (‘predecessor value method’), rather than at fair value. The consolidated financial statements for the combined group can then be prepared as a continuation of the accounting acquirer’s financial statements, without the recognition of an additional goodwill, through a retrospective restatement of comparative financial information, as if the combination had occured at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.

Control is considered to be transferred when the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them. CABB primarily generates income from the sale of goods. Within the product group “Exclusives and Specialities”, revenue from specific customer contracts is recognised over time. In these cases CABB’s performance obligation consists in the creation of an asset without an alternative use to CABB and CABB has an enforceable right to payment for the performance obligation completed to date. These contractually enforcable rights are recognised and disclosed within ‘Contract assets’. Certain customer contracts within the product group ‘Exclusives and Specialties’ provide for nonrefundable capital expenditure fees, paid by the customer at the beginning or during the project. These advance payments are disclosed within ‘Contract Liabilities’ and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in proportion to the performance used by the customer during the contract period. The outstanding performance obligation is disclosed in the balance sheet item ‘Contract ----- liabilities’ at each reporting date. It is possible that the performance obligation at a given point in time is in a contract asset or a contract liability position. If a customer contract does not meet these criteria, the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in time, and the corresponding sales revenue is hence recognised at a specific point in time. Determination of the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the goods occurs in the context of an overall assessment of the circumstances which considers the existence of a present claim to payment, the legal title to the goods, actual physical possession of the goods, the transfer of risks and rewards as well as customer acceptance. The transfer of risks and rewards takes into account the underlying terms of delivery (especially Incoterms) and is of particular practical significance. According to these principles, sales revenue from the sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised in the amount of the consideration the Group expects to receive in exchange for goods or services when control of the agreed-upon goods or services and the benefits obtainable from them is available to the customer. This is done on the basis of customer contracts and the performance obligations contained therein, which are individually identified. The transaction price is then determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract. Finally, revenue is recognised for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service is provided and the customer gains control either over time or at a point in time. Control lies with the customer if the customer can independently determine the use of and consume the benefit derived from a product or servies. Revenues from products are recognized at a point in time based on an overall assessment of the existence of a right of payment, the allocation of ownership rights, the transfer of physical possession, the transfer of risks and rewards, and acceptance by the customer; this is generally the case upon delivery. Within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, revenues for the product group “Exclusives”, are recognised over time, whereby for certain contracts within the product group “Exclusives”, the performance obligation consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities in exchange of a fixed remuneration, which is classified as a “stand ready obligation”. Within the business unit Acetyls, customer contracts generally only give rise to a single performance obligation in each case, which is to be fulfilled at a certain point in time based.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straightline-method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: (a) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; (b) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and (d) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. From 1 January 2021, where the basis for determining future lease payments changes as required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rate that reflects the change to an alternative benchmark interest rate. Leases in which CABB is a lessee mainly relate to transportation and technical equipment as well as land and buildings. The corresponding right-of-use assets are included in within ‘Property, plant and equipment’ or ‘Other intangible assets’ and the lease liabilities within ‘Other (non-current/ current) financial liabilities’ in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for low-value assets, and recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease contracts in which CABB acts as a lessor are exclusively operating leases, as these contracts do foresee the transfer of substantially all risks and rewards of utilising the underlying assets to the lessee.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, when CABB becomes a party of a financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash equivalents, and derivatives with positive fair values. Financial assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when CABB becomes a party to a financial instrument. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. The amount at which a financial asset is initially recognised comprises its fair value and in most cases the transaction costs. The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow condition (the “solely payments of principal and interest” criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset portfolios. Based on these two criteria, the following measurement categories are applicable: _Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash_ flow are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition established in IFRS 9. At CABB, derivatives are allocated to this measurement category, for example. CABB does not generally exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of financial instruments not to be measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances. _Financial assets measured at amortised cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to_ cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow conditions in IFRS 9, to the extent that the asset is held with the intention of collection the expected contractual cash flows over its term. At CABB, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivables that are not eligible for factoring, as well as miscellaneous assets and certain securities. A financial asset or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not a FVTPL, transactions costs that are directly attributable to is acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured amortised costs using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss. Initial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value, which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement effects are recognized in income using the effective interest method. Impairments are recognised for expected credit losses in both initial and subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence of any default event for financial assets measured at amortised costs and contract assets. If the counterparty is considered as having defaulted, an individual valuation allowance is generally recognised for the financial assets measured at amortised cost. In addition, a write-off must be recognised when the contractual conditions that form the basis for the receivable are changed through renegotiation in such a way that the present value of the future cash flows decreases. The extend of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period, impairments are generally only recognised for the 12-month expected credit losses. By contrast, under the simplified ----- approach for determining expected credit losses permitted by IFRS 9, impairments for receivables such as trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable concerned. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due. At CABB, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal information and external rating information on the respective counterparts. A significant increase in the counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The significance of the increase in the credit risk is not reviewed for trade accounts receivable. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have increased significantly. Regional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and expectations are taken into account when assessing the need for a valuation allowance as part of the calculation of expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances. In addition, CABB uses internal and external ratings and the assessments of credit insurers, when available. Individual valuation allowances are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks. Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortised costs, are likewise considered when calculating valuation allowances. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an immaterial extent. Expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances are only calculated for those receivables that were not covered by insurance or other collateral. The valuation allowances for receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognised in excess of the amount of the deductible. A decrease in valuation allowances due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after the valuation allowance is recorded in profit or loss. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets measured at amortised cost are credit impaired. This is the case if one or more events that have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the debtor, a breach of contract such a default or being more than 90 days past due; if it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. Loss allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For individual customers, the Group has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 180 days past due based on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets. The Group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. Financial assets are classified based on the group`s business model for managing the financial assets and on their contractual cash flow characteristics. The carrying amounts of the trade receivables are assumed to equal their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. Due to the short maturity of these receivables, the transaction price represents their fair value. Trade receivables sold under the securitisation programme, as well as the related liabilities are recognized to the extent of the credit risk retained (continuing involvement). _Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include all assets with_ contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9, to the extent that the asset is not just held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows of its term, but also generating cash flows from the sale of a portfolio. At CABB the eligible trade receivables for factoring fulfil these criteria. Assets measured at fair valued through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value, which usually corresponds to the nominal value of the securities, allocated to its category at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the time value are ----- recognised in other comprehensive income and the delta reclassified to the statement of income when the asset is disposed of. Impairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortised cost and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The following measurement categories are used for financial liabilities: _Financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided_ these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent measurement is recognised in profit or loss at amortised cost using the effective interest method. At CABB, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. _Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities._ These are likewise measured at the value of initial recognition. The latter also represents the measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently measure financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or has expired. Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument. If IFRS requires separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host contract and measured at fair value. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: ###### • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived form prices) ###### • Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) CABB uses the following valuation technique for determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities: Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves. This valuation technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and relies as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. There were no transfers between the different levels of fair value hierarchies in the financial reporting periods ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021.

Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill.

The resulting obligations are discounted by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate fixed rate bonds with an AA rating that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from periodic recalculation are recognised in other comprehensive income. They result from the variance between the actual development in pension obligations and pension assets and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year as well as the updating of actuarial assumptions. The calculation of pension provisions is based on actuarial reports. The current service costs which are associated with the work carried out in the reporting period are shown as personnel expenses in the costs of those functions in which the employees are operating, except where included in the cost of an asset. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets both at the beginning of the year. This cost is included in financial expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

Provisions are recognised for environmental protection measures and risks if, as a result of a past event, there is a current legal or constructive obligation to carry out measures. The probable settlement amount of non-current provisions is discounted, if the discounting effect is of a material nature.

The increase of the discounted amount resulting from the passage of time and the effect deriving from any change in the discount rate are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and classified as financial income or expense. Provisions for service anniversary payments are mainly calculated in accordance with actuarial principles. For semi-retirement agreements which have been concluded, the wage and salary payments to be made during the passive phase of the semi-retirement arrangement are accumulated in instalments, approved supplemental payments are accrued in instalments until the end of the exemption phase at the latest. Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.

Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of the future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by the Group also use statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions.

The goodwill impairment test is performed on the basis of cash-generating units (CGUs) by comparing the recoverable amount with the carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is calculated based on the fair value less costs to sell approach. The underlying cash flow projections are based on past experiences, current results and on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. Market assumptions, such as the development of the overall economy and the market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific information sources. The required discounting of cash flows for impairment testing is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital rate after tax, which is determined using the capital asset pricing model. It comprises a risk-free interest rate, a makret risk premium, and a spread for credit risk based on the respective industry-specific peer group. The fair value measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair value. On November 17, 2021, the Group announced a reorganisation of its group structure to become a fully integrated contract development and manufacturing company under a centralised “One CABB” organisation managing sales, procurement, production and administration. As part of the change, the former business units Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls were combined into one and the internal management reporting to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) was aligned accordingly in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2021. Consistent with the new internal management and reporting structure, the following three cash generating units have been identified: (i) CDMO – Europe, (ii) CDMO – North America, (iii) Non - CDMO. The CGUs reflect the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The existing goodwill was allocated to the new CGUs in accordance with the purchase price allocation in 2014 for the CGU CDMO – Europe and the CGU Non – CDMO resp. 2019 for the CGU CDMO – North America.. The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2021. Due to the changed segment reporting and the consecutive changes of the CGUs two sets of impairment tests were performed: one for the former CGU structure (Acetyls and Custom Manufacturing) and one for the new CGU structure (CDMO – Europe, CDMO – North America and Non – CDMO). The financial projections were approved by management and consist of a detailed planning period of five years. The following table provides an overview of the goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and of the calculation parameters used for the new CGU structure: ----- As of December 31, 2021, the recoverable amount of all cash-generating units exceed their carrying amounts, so that no goodwill impairment is indicated. Until the third quarter of the financial year 2021, the group’s internal management reporting to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) was organised by business units (BU’s): (i) BU Custom Manufacturing, comprising CABB AG, Pratteln (Switzerland); CABB Oy, Kokkola (Finland) and Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation, Galena, Kansas (USA). (ii) BU Acetyls, comprising CABB GmbH, Gersthofen (Germany) and CABB Jinwei Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co. Ltd. (PRC). The Acetyls and Custom Manufacturing units were identified as cash-generating units constituting the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill was monitored for internal management purposes.

In the financial year 2021, the total actual income from plan assets amounted to kEUR 16,968 (2020: kEUR 8,824), thereof in Switzerland kEUR 17,374 (2020: kEUR 6,953) and in Finland kEUR -406 (2020: kEUR 1,871). In 2021, additional employer contributions of kEUR 5,230 (2020: kEUR 4,702) were made into statutory pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans). Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant: - If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligaton would decrease by kEUR 14,341 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 17,113) (increase by kEUR 15,955; December 31, 2020: kEUR 19,071). - If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 13,080 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 14,829) (decrease by kEUR 12,194; December 31, 2020: kEUR 13,707). - If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 980 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 1,128) (decrease by kEUR 955, December 31, 2020: kEUR 1,093). The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position. The Group expects to make a contribution of kEUR 3,924 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 3,538) to the defined benefit plans during the next financial year. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Group’s overall risk management seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. In November 2019, the Group joined a factoring contract of one of its customers, in the course of which trade receivables due from a major customer are settled through a bank. Since June 2020, the Group sells without recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured entity under an asset-backed securitisation programme. The financing volume is committed to a maximum amount of kEUR 30,000. The structured entity is not controlled by CABB and therefore not consolidated by the Group. The special purpose entity obtains its funding primarily from capital markets through the issuance of commercial papers and has mandated the Group to service the receivables in return for an at arm’s-length fee. The structured entity has the contractual right to terminate this service agreement and may appoint as substitute servicer any other person. The Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a revolving basis at their nominal value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is presented as part of other financial receivables and represents the Group’s right to receive this amount once the trade receivables sold have been settled by the customers. To the extend to which the credit risk is retained by the Group (continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and corresponding other financial liabilities are recognised. The carrying amount of trade receivables transferred under the securitisation programme amounted to kEUR 24,288 as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 23,844), of which kEUR 23,662 have been derecognised (December 31, 2020: kEUR 23,285); and kEUR 3,325 (December 31, 2020: kEUR 3,036), representing the retained reserve, is presented as part of other current financial receivables.

These notes bear a nominal interest rate equal to the 3 month EURIBOR plus 5.250%, whereby if the 3m EURIBOR is less than zero, such rate is deemed to be zero.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2020, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (“Law of 23 July 2016”) and with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the “Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (“CSSF”). Our responsibilities under the Law of 23 July 2016 and ISAs are further described in the « Responsibilities of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements » section of our report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA Code”) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other information The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the consolidated management report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” thereon. ----- ###### Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Responsibilities of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé for the audit of the consolidated financial statements The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: ##### — Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial ###### statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ##### — Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit ###### procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. ----- ##### — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of ###### accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors. ##### — Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of ###### accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of “Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. ##### — Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial ###### statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ##### — Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the ###### entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.

The Company’s sole shareholder is Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., Luxembourg, an entity which is beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds. On October 7, 2019, Monitchem S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) (the “Contributor”), a wholly owned subsidiay of Permira Funds, and Monitchem Midco S.à r.l., the direct parent company of Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., entered into a contribution agreement, pursuant to which the Contributor transferred the entire shares of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg), to Monitchem Midco S.à. r.l. (Luxembourg), which in turn contributed such shares to the capital reserves of its indirect subsidiary Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. (Luxembourg), through a contribution in kind without issue of shares. The shares were then contributed down the chain of subsidiaries, such that Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. (Luxembourg) is ultimately held by CABB Europe GmbH (Germany). As this transaction involved only entities, which are ultimately controlled by Permira funds, the Group decided to account for this transaction by applying the predecessor value method through a retrospective restatement of comparative financial information, as if the transaction had occurred in the financial year 2018. CABB is one of the leading European producers of customised active ingredients, advanced intermediates and diversified specialty chemicals with a focus on the agrochemical industry. Our business operations are organized in two business units, the Custom Manufacturing business unit and the Acetyls business unit. The Custom Manufacturing business unit focuses on the production of exclusives and intermediates. Exclusives are active ingredients and advanced intermediates customised for individual customers operating in the agrochemicals, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries. Our exclusives are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides in the agrochemicals industry and range from pilot scale to large-volume commercial operations. Our intermediates are products manufactured for multiple customers and include acid chlorides, chemical building blocks and various base chemicals. They are to a large extent used in agrochemical applications but also in other diverse end-uses, such as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and dyestuffs for textile application. The Group is one of the leading custom manufacturing suppliers in the European agrochemicals market by revenues, serving the major global agrochemicals companies and holds strategic supplier status with the largest, European-based agrochemical companies for their agrochemicals business. Our customised products are highly integrated in our key customers’ supply chains (often protected by solesupplier relationships for major products) and we are closely aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination. Our key agrochemicals customers are active in a structurally growing global market driven by population growth, improving living standards and changing dietary trends especially in emerging markets. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we operate complementary multipurpose production facilities in Pratteln (Switzerland), Kokkola (Finland) and Galena (USA). The Acetyls business unit is focused on the production of monochloroacetic acid (MCA), acetyl derivatives and co-products, which have a variety of applications in the agrochemicals, food, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. Our key customers’ end-markets follow different demand patterns and demonstrate different levels of cyclicality, leading to a diversified market exposure for ----- CABB and as such demonstrated relative resilience versus economic downturns. We produce MCA in different purity grades (ultra-pure, high pure, technical global and technical local) for different applications and regional markets and in different trade forms (flakes, solution, molten and sodium monochloroacetic acid) to enable longer distance transportation based on the customer’s preference and location. We also offer our customers a range of derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid and trichloroacetic acid, among others. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and are sold to customers or used captively in subsequent processes and production steps. We are one of the principal suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas. The Acetyls business unit operates three production facilities globally: two in Germany and one in China through our cooperation with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd..",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at of before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straightline-method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: (a) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; (b) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and (d) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a ----- change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘loans and borrowings’ in the statement of financial position. The Group has elected to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for low-value assets, and recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on straight-line basis over the lease term. Assets used by the Group as lessee under operating lease arrangements are not capitalised. The lease payments to be made are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. A finance lease is defined as a lease in which essentially all risks and rewards of an asset which are associated with ownership of the asset are transferred to the lessee. Assets used under finance lease arrangements are shown at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of minimum lease payments. The lease payment to be made is broken down into repayment of principal and an interest component. The repayment of principal reduces the liability, whereas the interest component is reported as interest expense. Depreciation is recognised over the economic useful life or the shorter life of the lease. The payment obligations resulting from the future lease instalments are shown under financial liabilities. Details of the leases are set out in the notes (17).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, when CABB becomes a party of a financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash equivalents, and derivatives with positive fair values. Financial assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when CABB becomes a party to a financial instrument. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. The amount at which a financial asset is initially recognised comprises its fair value and in most cases the transaction costs. The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow condition (the “solely payments of principle and interest” criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset portfolios. Based on these two criteria, the following measurement categories are applicable: _Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash_ flow are not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition established in IFRS 9. At CABB, derivatives are allocated to this measurement category, for example. CABB does not generally exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of financial instruments not to be measure at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances. _Financial assets measured at amortised cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to_ cash flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest ----- on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow conditions in IFRS 9, to the extent that the asset is held with the intention of collection the expected contractual cash flows over its term. At CABB, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivables, as well as miscellaneous assets and certain securities. Initial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value (except for trade accounts receivables, which are measured at their transaction price), which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of acquisition. Impairments are recognised for expected credit losses in both initial and subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence of any default event for financial assets measured at amortised costs and contract assets. If the counterparty is considered as having defaulted, an individual valuation allowance is generally recognised for the financial assets measured at amortised cost. In addition, a valuation allowance must be recognised when the contractual conditions that form the basis for the receivable are changed through renegotiation in such a way that the present value of the future cash flows decreases. The extend of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, expected credit losses are generally recognised over the lifetime of the asset. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period, impairments are generally only recognised for the 12-month expected credit losses. By contrast, under the simplified approach for determining expected credit losses permitted by IFRS 9, impairments for receivables such as trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable concerned. The Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due. At CABB, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal information and external rating information on the respective counterparts. A significant increase in the counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The significance of the increase in the credit risk is not reviewed for trade accounts receivable. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have increased significantly. Regional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and expectations are taken into account when assessing the need for a valuation allowance as part of the calculation of expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances. In addition, CABB uses internal and external ratings and the assessments of credit insurers, when available. Individual valuation allowances are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks. Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortised costs, are likewise considered when calculating valuation allowances. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an immaterial extent. Expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances are only calculated for those receivables that were not covered by insurance or other collateral. The valuation allowances for receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognised in excess of the amount of the deductible. A decrease in valuation allowances due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after the valuation allowance is recorded in profit or loss. Reversals of valuation allowances may not exceed amortised cost, less any expected future credit losses. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets measured at amortised cost are credit impaired. This is the case if one or more events that have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: significant financial difficulty of the debtor, a breach of contract such a default or being more than 90 days past due; if it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation or the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. Loss allowances are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For individual customers, the Group has a policy of writing off the gross carrying amount when the financial asset is 180 days past due based on historical experience of recoveries of similar assets. The Group expects no significant ----- recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due. _Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include all assets with_ contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9, to the extent that the asset is not just held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows of its term, but also generating cash flows from its sale. At CABB, no contract incurred throughout the financial year 2020, which fulfils the criteria of described measurement category. CABB does not exercise the option to subsequently measure equity instruments through other comprehensive income. Assets measured at fair valued through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value, which usually corresponds to the nominal value of the securities, allocated to its category at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the time value are recognised in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of income when the asset is disposed of. Impairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortised cost and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The following measurement categories are used for financial liabilities: _Financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided_ these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent measurement is recognised in profit or loss at amortised cost using the effective interest method. At CABB, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. _Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities._ These are likewise measured at the value of initial recognition. The latter also represents the measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently measure financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or has expired. Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument. If IFRS requires separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host contract and measured at fair value. If IFRS 9 does not provide for separation, the hybrid instrument is accounted for at fair value in its entirety. CABB uses the following valuation techniques for determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities: Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte Carlo simulation. For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is calibrated such that the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (Bourse de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing model also considers the risk-free interest rate as another paramater. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. ----- If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. As in prior year there were no transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchies in the financial reporting period ended December 31, 2020. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set-off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The deferred taxes on income are accrued on the basis of the current or substantively enacted local tax rate expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the forseeable future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. A combined tax rate of 24.94% is used in Luxembourg. Country-specific tax rates are used for the other companies.

The resulting obligations are discounted by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate fixed rate bonds with an AA rating that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from periodic recalculation are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of the future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by the Group also use statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions.

For the financial year 2020, the actual income from plan assets amounted to kEUR 6,954 (2019: kEUR 15,745) in Switzerland and to kEUR 1,872 (2019: kEUR 2,681) in Finland. In 2020, additional employer contributions of kEUR 4,702 (2019: kEUR 4,590) were made into statutory pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans). Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant: - If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligaton would decrease by kEUR 17,113 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 16,873) (increase by kEUR 19,071; December 31, 2019: kEUR 18,803). ----- - If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 14,829 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 14,600) (decrease by kEUR 13,707; December 31, 2019: kEUR 13,485). - If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 1,128 (December 31, 2019: KEUR 1,178) (decrease by kEUR 1,093, December 31, 2019: kEUR 1,151). The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.

Similar contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transations in similar instruments. - **Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves. - **Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte Carlo simulation. For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is calibrated such that the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (Bourse de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing model also considers the risk-free interest rate as another paramater. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. There are no financial instruments, which require a determination of fair values based on unobservable inputs (level 3). Derivative financial instruments (embedded derivatives in the indenture and interest rate swaps not included in a designated hedging relationship) are categorised as “at fair value through profit or loss” in accordance with IFRS 9. They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). The value of the embedded derivatives is affected by the interest of the comparable market instrument on each potential exercise date and will rise if the relevant interest rate declines and vice versa. Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “at amortised cost” under IFRS 9 as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference date are approximately equivalent to the fair value. Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the interest income and expense, the amortisation of arrangement fees, bank fees and other fees, the result from the translation of foreign currencies and other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss which are not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9. ----- Net gains and losses from financial instruments by valuation categories are as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

The Group’s overall risk management seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. In November 2019, the Group joined a reverse factoring contract of one of its customers, in the course of which trade receivables due from a major customer are settled through a bank. Since June 2020, the Group sells without recourse a portion of its trade receivables to a structured entity under an asset-backed securitisation programme. The financing volume is committed to a maximum amount of kEUR 30,000. The structured entity is not controlled by CABB and therefore not consolidated by the Group. The special purpose entity obtains its funding primarily from capital markets through the issuance of commercial papers and has mandated the Group to service the receivables in return for an at arm’s-length fee. The structured entity has the contractual right to terminate this service agreement and may appoint as substitute servicer any other person. The Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the trade receivables on a revolving basis at their nominal value less a retained reserve in exchange for cash. The net amount is presented as part of other financial receivables and represents the Group’s right to receive this amount once the trade receivables sold have been settled by the customers. To the extend to which the credit risk is retained by the Group (continuing involvement), sold trade receivables and corresponding other financial liabilities are recognised. The carrying amount of trade receivables transferred under the securitisation programme amounted to kEUR 23,844 as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0), of which kEUR 23,285 have been derecognised (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0); and kEUR 3,036 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0), representing the retained reserve, is presented as part of other current financial receivables. The carrying amount of trade receivables (classified as trade receivables) and the other financial liability resulting from the continuing involvement amounted to kEUR 559 as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: kEUR 0).",N/A,as_expected,2023,544

While these risks are relevant to the financing activities of the Group (long term notes), they are not of significant importance for the Group’s operating activities. Borrowings issued at variable interest rates exposes the Group cash flow interest rate risks. On October 7, 2019, the Group has refinanced the existing Floating Rate Notes by issuing Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes in an amount of kEUR 175,000. These notes bear a nominal interest rate equal to the 3 month EURIBOR plus 5.250%, whereby if the 3m EURIBOR is less than zero, such rate is deemed to be zero. Given the currrent and prospective short term interest rate environment, the Group did not enter into new interest rate swaps during the reporting period. The existing floating-to-fixed interest rate swap, which mitigated to a large extent the cash flow interest rate risks under the former variable interest rate financing agreements matured on June 15, 2019. ----- The following table shows the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments and the exposure to the interest rate risk:",N/A,as_expected,2023,544
