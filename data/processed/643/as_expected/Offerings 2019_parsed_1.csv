The review revealed that the separation criteria of an embedded derivative had been applicable in the financial statements since 2014. As a consequence, we recognized embedded derivatives related to early redemption options in the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not consider the effect of this separation to be a material error with respect to the financial statements adjustment for the financial year ended December 31, 2017, nor for any of the financial statements prior to 2017; however, in order to increase transparency and to provide better communication to the markets, the errors have been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior years 2015 and 2016 by applying IAS 8.42 et seq. by analogy in the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The correction resulted in an increase of other long-term financial assets and long-term notes liability as well as in changes to interest expenses, other financial income/expenses and deferred taxes on income. There was no impact on operating, investing or financing cash flows due to this correction. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Prior period _restatement impacting the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements” and Note 24 to the 2017 Audited_ Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Transition effects are recognized cumulatively in equity as of the date of initial application without restating prior-period information, which is presented in accordance with previous rules. In accordance with IFRS 15.C7, only contracts that had not yet been completed as of the date of initial application were transitioned to the new standard. Contract modifications arising prior to the date of first-time application (IFRS 15.C7 A(b)) did not have to be accounted for. As part of the xiv ----- adoption of the new standard, the items “contract assets” and “contract liability” were added to the balance sheet. Advance payments received in connection with product deliveries were previously included within trade accounts payable. With the introduction of IFRS 15, these advance payments received are presented as contract liabilities. Within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, revenue for certain products within the exclusives product group are now recognized over time rather than at a certain point in time. Revenue for these products are now recognized when payments become unconstrained, leading to an earlier revenue recognition as compared to revenue recognition under IAS 18. As of January 1, 2018, this change led to the recognition of contract assets in an amount of €5.5 million and to a reduction of inventories in an amount of €3.6 million. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of €1.5 million increasing retained earnings were recognized as of January 1, 2018. For certain contracts within the exclusives product group, the performance obligation consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities (“stand ready obligation”) within the contract period, leading to a deferred revenue recognition as compared to revenue recognition under IAS 18. As of January 1, 2018, this change led to the recognition of contract liabilities in an amount of €3.8 million. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of €3.1 million reducing retained earnings were recognized. Within the Acetyls business unit, the transition to IFRS 15 had no impact on the timing of revenue recognition, as customer contracts refer to standardized products, which generally only give rise to a performance obligation, which is to be fulfilled at a certain point in time. In total, as of January 1, 2018, due to the changed timing of revenue recognition, we recognized contract assets of €5.5 million, a decrease in inventories of €3.6 million and contract liabilities of €3.8 million. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of €1.6 million decreasing retained earnings were recognized as of January 1, 2018. The introduction of IFRS 15 led to a €0.1 million increase in net sales and a €0.9 million decrease in cost of sales in the financial year 2018, resulting in a €0.2 million increase in deferred tax expense in 2018 as compared to revenue recognition under IAS 18.

IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for lease contracts, subject to limited exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. At transition, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at January 1, 2018. Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. The Group applied this approach to all leases. The application of IFRS 16 did not lead to any impacts on retained earnings. In conjunction with the transition to the new accounting standard, right-of-use assets of €10.2 million and lease liabilities of €10.2 million were recognized as of January 1, 2018.

We define “capital expenditure” as expenditures relating to facility upgrades and capacity expansion projects, optimization and de-bottlenecking projects and maintenance projects, as well as expenditures on intangible assets, including information and communications technology, research and development.

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Business Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading European producer of customized active ingredients, advanced intermediates and diversified specialty chemicals with a focus on the agrochemicals industry. Our business operations are organized into two business units, Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls, which accounted for 59.6% and 40.4%, respectively, of our total revenue for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 on a like-for-like basis. Our Custom Manufacturing business unit focuses on the production of exclusives and intermediates. Exclusives are active ingredients and advanced intermediates customized for individual customers operating in the agrochemicals, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries. Our exclusives (74% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018) are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides in the agrochemicals industry and range from pilot scale to large-volume commercial operations. Our intermediates (26% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018) are products manufactured for multiple customers and include acid chlorides, chemical building blocks and various base chemicals. They are to a large extent used in agrochemical and pharmaceutical applications, but also in other diverse end-uses such as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and dyestuffs for textile application. Our Acetyls business unit focuses on the production of monochloroacetic acid, or MCA, acetyl derivatives and co-products, which have a variety of applications in the agrochemicals, food, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. MCA, the business unit’s main product, accounted for 61% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. Derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid and trichloroacetic acid, accounted for 19% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and accounted for 20% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. The end uses for our agrochemicals are spread across a number of crops, with 46% of agrochemicals revenue attributable to corn, 9% to cereal, 6% to soy, 5% to food and vegetables and 34% to other products for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Agrochemicals revenue are also spread across different applications, with 68% attributable to herbicide applications, 29% to fungicides and 3% to insecticides for the same period. Following the Contribution, we believe we would be the second largest European custom manufacturing supplier in the global agrochemicals market by sales. We are also one of the four principal suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas. Our key agrochemicals customers are active in a structurally growing global market driven by population growth, improving living standards and changing dietary trends, especially in emerging markets, as well as growing demand for biofuels and yield improvements. We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from positive long-term growth trends in the agrochemicals market and are investing in capacity and yield improvement to support the growth of our business. Headquartered in Germany, we operate production facilities in Germany, Switzerland, Finland and China. In Custom Manufacturing, we operate two large production facilities, in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland). In Acetyls, we operate three technologically-advanced production facilities: in Gersthofen and Knapsack (Germany) and in Jining, Shandong Province (China) through our majority-owned joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd. We benefit from the cost advantage of operating large-scale, highly integrated production facilities strategically located near key customers and suppliers as well as transportation networks. 1 ----- For the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019, we generated total revenue of €470.6 million and Group Adjusted EBITDA of €93.8 million, while Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $12.6 million and Combined Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €104.8 million. For the same period, our Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls business units accounted for 60.6% and 39.4% of our total revenue, respectively.

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Industry Overview,9.2.1,,"The global agrochemicals industry has been one of the main drivers of agricultural productivity increases over the past decades. Industry research firm Phillips McDougall estimates that the global crop protection industry accounted for approximately $57.6 billion in sales in 2018, having grown at a CAGR of 2.9% per annum from 2016 to 2018. The growth of custom manufacturing is driven by the major global agrochemicals players’ use of outsourcing as a source of additional production capacity in order to serve the steadily increasing global demand for agrochemicals. In recent years, agrochemicals companies have allocated a larger share of production to external custom manufacturers, which provide flexible multi-purpose and multi-product capacity. Outsourcing reduces agrochemical companies’ asset intensity, limits the risks associated with large, upfront investments and allows them to deploy capital with a stronger focus on their core capabilities, such as research and development as well as marketing and distribution. This trend is supported by new molecules becoming increasingly complex and more active, often based on multi-step synthesis, which requires demanding technical capabilities. Custom manufacturers typically work in close co-operation and often on an exclusive or near-exclusive basis for select products with agrochemical companies in order to set up scalable manufacturing units and efficient production processes. This production know-how, combined with often lengthy product registration, generally results in low customer churn and high contract renewal rates in custom manufacturing. For Acetyls, according to Tecnon OrbiChem, the global MCA market in 2018 was approximately 1.867kt. Global MCA trade flows are often characterized by regional supply and demand due to the corrosive nature of MCA and relatively high transportation costs, which encourage proximity to customers. CABB and Nouryon (formerly Akzo Nobel) are currently the only large-scale producers of high-purity grade MCA, which is mostly used in developed markets and has high-end applications.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.1,Leading market positions globally supported by high barriers to entry,"We have leading market positions in the Western European and, after giving effect to the Contribution, the U.S. markets in which we operate. Following the Contribution, we believe we would be the second largest European custom manufacturing supplier in the global agrochemicals market by sales. We serve four of the top five global agrochemicals companies, which accounted for approximately 61% of the global agrochemicals market by revenue in 2018, according to Phillips McDougall. We believe that three of these global agrochemical companies regard us as a strategic supplier for their agrochemicals business. We also have a foothold in non-agrochemical end-markets, such as life-sciences and flavors and fragrances. Our customized products are highly integrated in our key customers’ supply chains (often protected by “key supplier” relationships for major products) and we are closely aligned in demand planning and coordination. We have flexible, multi-purpose custom manufacturing plants that allow for optimized downtimes between different product campaigns and change-overs. We believe we are the largest MCA supplier in Europe and the second largest MCA supplier globally based on production capacity. We attribute our strong market positions to the high quality of our products, our long-standing customer relationships, our proprietary MCA purification technology, our cost advantageous hydrogenation production technology and backward integrated electrolysis technology. We are one of the few MCA manufacturers capable of producing the highest purity grades in different application forms. 2 ----- Our strong market positions in both custom manufacturing and acetyls are supported by high barriers to entry, preventing new competitors from easily entering these markets. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we possess strong technical experience and process design capabilities, which are important for securing new contracts. We believe that a new market-entrant seeking to replicate our facilities in Pratteln and Kokkola would face large capital investment costs. We are also protected by high switching costs for our customers due to our high integration into our customers’ supply chains and their participation in capital expenditures related to the developments of new products. In the Acetyls business unit, we believe that our production plants would require large capital investments to replicate. The acetyls market is regional in nature due to specific product characteristics such as corrosiveness, which encourage proximity to customers and involve complex logistical planning. In addition, both the custom manufacturing and acetyls industries are subject to European Union regulations, including the REACH regulation and lengthy registration and approval processes, which limit the risk of new entrants.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.2,Resilient megatrends driving attractive growth in agrochemicals,"The agrochemicals industry is our key end-market with 65% of Custom Manufacturing business unit sales in 2018 attributable to this sector. Although the global agrochemicals market declined after 2014 due to decreased crop commodity prices and subsequently lower net cash farm income, lower pest pressure and recession in South America, the market has recently shown signs of recovery, with agrochemicals players reporting year-on-year growth in early 2019 until severe North American weather conditions led to a temporary downturn due to limited crop planting in this region. Key drivers of historical growth in the agrochemicals industry include global trends in population growth, increasing meat consumption and rising demand for crops and food, while the food, personal care and cosmetics end-markets have historically been relatively resilient to changes in general economic conditions. Overall, the crop protection industry grew at a CAGR of 5.3% per annum from 2008 to 2014, declined at a rate of 2.6% from 2014 to 2017 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2017 to 2023, according to the industry research firm Phillips McDougall. Another trend we benefit from is the outsourcing of manufacturing processes in the crop protection market. Due to increasing product complexity, potential to achieve additional cost savings or to improve returns and sector consolidation, certain agrochemical players choose to focus on key elements of their value chain (research and development and marketing) over manufacturing. We believe that this trend has resulted in a steadily increasing share of outsourced manufacturing. According to third-party information, the outsourcing share of the crop protection sector represented a market of $4-5 billion in 2017. Moreover, as major agrochemical players focus more on research and development (for example, molecule discovery), they require partners with know-how on how to bring lab processes to plant scale. In line with this trend, we launched a new service called “ChemCreations” which offers our customers production process development services such as process research and development. This additional service allows us to participate in the early stages of our clients’ product development, which increases the likelihood that their production processes will be outsourced to us at later stages.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.3,Long-standing blue-chip customer base with high visibility of revenues,"We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers. Based on revenue in 2018, approximately 80% of our top ten customer relationships exceed ten years and approximately 50% extend to more than 30 years. We are a trusted partner to many leading agrochemicals and specialties companies who rely on our solutions and significant expertise for their products and applications. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, typical customer contracts range in length from three to five years, which provides us with good revenue visibility. For example, more than 50% of our revenue from our top 14 agrochemicals exclusives in 2018 was generated by contracts with a term of three or more years. Together with the revenue visibility such longer-term contracts provide, our customers’ long-term commitments are supported by a track record of co-investments in production facilities through upfront capital expenditure or top-up pricing over the term of the contract. Our customer base in custom manufacturing reflects the concentration of the crop protection market, with the top six customers by revenue accounting for approximately 78% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. We are a “key supplier”, supplying over 90% of the customers’ supply, of select active ingredients and advanced intermediates for certain customers. For example, approximately 70% of our revenue from our top 14 agrochemical exclusives revenue was generated under key supplier agreements in the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Our customer base includes four of the top five global agrochemicals companies with whom we work 3 ----- in close cooperation in terms of process development and planning. In addition, while agrochemicals are a key end market for our Custom Manufacturing products (representing 65% of revenue of the business unit in 2018), we are diversifying into other applications, such as high-value intermediates, pharmaceuticals and specialties (representing 26%, 8% and 1% of revenue of the business unit in 2018, respectively). In the Acetyls business unit, our MCA revenue is well-diversified among end-markets including home and personal care, agrochemicals, food and pharmaceuticals, among others. We currently expect these end-markets to exhibit growth rates from the low to mid single digits (pharmaceuticals) to the mid single digits (personal care and packaged food) in the coming years. Diversified applications allow our acetyls business to be exposed to favorable growth prospects in a wide range of industries, such as crop protection, packaged food and personal care.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.4,High visibility on lifecycle and returns with attractive product pipeline and strategic partnerships in custom manufacturing,"Our Custom Manufacturing business unit has developed strategic partnerships with well-known companies, including some of the largest global agrochemicals producers. Due to our high level of integration with our customers’ product development and long contract terms, we have high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Our long-term contracts often provide for guaranteed volumes in the initial period, contributing to a high contract renewal rate and low customer churn. Moreover, our customers often pay part of the capital expenditures related to new product developments, while minimum contract terms provide payback of the capital expenditures incurred directly by us. We have a strong track record of securing strategic launch projects with the top four agrochemical majors. We estimate based on publicly available information that such customers inquired with us regarding more than half of their public product launches during the years from 2015 to 2018, and that we won 43% of those products inquired about. A typical payback period on our projects is three to four years, and we have an attractive pipeline of growth projects. Between 2017 and the end of the year 2019, we expect to have spent approximately €22 million on capital expenditures for growth projects, and we expect to spend more than €55 million on further growth projects with our customers in the future. In addition, we believe that the Contribution has tangible synergy potential and will contribute to our future growth. Additionally, we believe that Jayhawk has state-of-the-art facilities with standalone high single digit growth potential based on its existing portfolio and the ramping up of new products. Jayhawk’s attractive end-market exposure is complementary to ours and includes industries such as specialties, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (representing approximately 65%, 19% and 16% of Jayhawk revenues in 2018, respectively). We believe that the Contribution of the Target would provide us with an opportunity to gain additional U.S. exposure and target further fine chemicals customers beyond the agrochemicals market.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.5,Highly efficient integrated production footprint and logistics set up,"We believe that our efficient and technologically advanced production facilities, combined with our integrated operations, process development expertise and proprietary hydrogenation technology, enable us to maintain leading market positions. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we operate complementary multi-purpose production facilities in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland) with combined batch reactor capacity of approximately 800 cubic meters (large batch volume production capabilities in Kokkola and full scale-up capabilities in Pratteln). We produce on-site a substantial amount of the raw materials required for production at our Pratteln facility, and the facility’s backward integration enables many by-products to be recycled for internal use, thereby reducing waste and helping us to maintain a competitive cost structure. In addition, through systematic optimization of process parameters, improvement of maintenance service and change-over scheduling as well as Lean Six Sigma tools training, we are aiming to increase our production further in the coming years. Our Acetyls business unit’s production facilities in Germany and our Chinese site use our proprietary hydrogenation technology for the production of MCA, which provides significant production cost and product quality advantages over the alternative crystallization technology. Our Gersthofen facility uses backward-integrated electrolysis technology for captive chlorine production, while our Knapsack facility and our Chinese facility source chlorine on-site via a pipeline from adjacent third-party PVC chlorine plants, which repurchase the hydrochloric acid generated during the production of MCA. We believe that the high level of capital investment required to develop integrated and efficient production facilities, combined with the technological expertise required for the production processes, are key factors to our operating success and the limited number of new competitors entering our markets. 4 ----- Moreover, we consider our logistics capabilities as a key differentiator from our competitors. We currently have a large in-house managed leased fleet to transport high corrosion materials required in our production processes, and we are also modernizing our fleet with leased titanium railcars to transport MCA. These titanium railcars are 40% lighter than regular railcars and can capture 30% more product volumes. In addition, we are in the process of rolling out GPS tracking for all railcars across our fleet to allow for constant information flow to customers and rapid action in case of delays. Finally, our logistics team is in most cases capable of finding alternative routes for deliveries in case of unexpected events.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Our Group Adjusted EBITDA has grown from €88.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €93.8 million for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019. After taking into effect the Contribution of Jayhawk, which had Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 million, our Combined Adjusted EBITDA would be €104.8 million for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019. Over the same period, our Group Adjusted EBITDA margin has increased from 19.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 19.9% for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019. We believe our limited exposure to fluctuations of raw materials prices through backward integration, pass-through clauses in the majority of our customer contracts by sales and direct supply of raw materials by customers under longer-term agreements, as well our high utilization rates and economies of scale, have supported our margins as we seek to grow our production volumes. In addition, we believe our working capital management and the recent investments in increased reliability, capacity and efficiency will increase returns as well as customer satisfaction, which could lead to additional projects. Our Acetyls business has shown that despite an increasing overall German cost basis, the business can increase profitability by increasing efficiency and utilization.

Jayhawk, located in the United States, produces customized agricultural, pharmaceutical, and specialty chemicals and offers the potential for standalone growth from its existing pipeline portfolio and production of new products as well as proximity to customers in the Americas. In addition, we believe our Pratteln and our Kokkola sites will benefit from cooperation with Jayhawk and the possibility for customers to have two sources to ensure reliability, which is a key requirement for customers in our agrochemicals and specialties markets. Moreover, we believe that the addition of process development services (such as ChemCreations) allows us to capture potential business opportunities at earlier stages, and we are planning to promote these services to non-agrochemical customers. We believe that the acquisition of Jayhawk opens up the possibility to generate synergies with our custom manufacturing business unit through joint customer development and growth driven by expansion projects 5 ----- and new product introductions. Our timeline for realizing the synergies is to first, among others, realize initial overhead savings, review our product portfolios and assess if our sites can produce raw materials for Jayhawk and generate joint purchasing savings. In the mid-term, among others, we aim at bundling our strengths to further explore opportunities in North America, regionally expand our specialty anhydrites business outside of the United States, optimize our production network, share our logistics capabilities and benefit from the removal of structural overlaps. In our Acetyls business unit, we continue to focus on high capacity utilization as the key success factor for sustainable development as well as optimized logistics solutions such as the addition of our leased titanium fleet of railcars which will allow for the delivery of more product with less railcars due to its lower weight and better loading factor.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

To comply with regulations that required the phase-out of mercury technology by the end of 2017, we introduced electrolysis membrane technology in Pratteln in 2016 to replace our mercury-based technology, reduce our energy costs and minimize safety risks associated with the transport of chlorine necessary for our production processes. We are committed to implementing industry-leading global health, safety and environmental standards at all of our productions sites and for the benefit of all of our employees, in many cases going beyond local regulations and requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

In 1997, Hoechst Specialty Chemicals business was acquired by Clariant. 6 ----- Several years later, in 2003, CABB was founded as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clariant before being acquired by Gilde Investment Management in 2005 and then by AXA Private Equity in the following year. In 2007, we acquired SF Chem, including our production facility in Pratteln (Switzerland), which allowed us to expand into custom manufacturing. In 2011, we were acquired by Bridgepoint, the same year we acquired KemFine from 3i and commenced production at our facility in Kokkola, Finland, to further expand our custom manufacturing capabilities. In 2013, we expanded our footprint to Asia through the establishment of a joint venture with Jining Jinwei Gold Power to acquire Jinwei Huasheng Chemicals. We hold a 67% stake in the joint venture entity CABB-Jinwei Specialty Chemicals (Jining) Co., Ltd. In 2014, we were acquired by Permira Funds and have since invested in an electrolysis plant in Pratteln, capacity expansions and debottlenecking in most facilities as well as in a new waste water facility in China.

The Contribution is expected to be completed on or about the Issue Date, but in any event, within five business days following the Issue Date. We expect to commence the liquidation of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. in 2020, which would leave its direct subsidiary, Kansas HoldCo, Inc., as a direct subsidiary of CABB Europe GmbH. The Target consists of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries, including Jayhawk, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals products with a production facility in Galena, Kansas in the United States. The Contribution will provide us with an established platform for operations in the U.S. specialty chemicals market, a segment and geography in which we currently only have a presence by way of our sales office in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Contribution will also provide us with an existing base of customers and contracts in the region. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, Jayhawk generated revenues of $22.4 million and $26.4 million and Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively. For the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, Jayhawk generated revenues of $51.4 million and $50.8 million and Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 million and $11.9 million, respectively. For the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, Jayhawk made capital expenditures of $7.8 million (of which $4.9 million was related to maintenance and $2.9 million was related to expansion) and $6.6 million (of which $3.5 million was related to maintenance and $3.1 million was related to expansion), respectively. For the financial year ended December 31, 2018, Jayhawk’s specialty anhydrides business accounted for approximately 46% of its revenues and Jayhawk’s custom manufacturing business accounted for approximately 54% of its revenues. Jayhawk’s end-market exposure is complementary to ours and includes industries such as specialties, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (representing approximately 65%, 19% and 16% of Jayhawk revenues in 2018, respectively). On a regional basis, Jayhawk derived approximately 62% of its revenue from North America, 19% from the EMEA region and 19% from Asia in 2018. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, Jayhawk had an average of 120 employees. While Jayhawk has maintained levels of net working capital that amount to approximately half its sales in each of the financial 7 ----- years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 and the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019, we believe this is primarily due to the stocking of a key product with high margins.

This information has been prepared by management and is based on assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties. We caution you that the following information has not been audited, reviewed, verified or subject to any procedures by our auditors, and you should not place undue reliance on it. We believe the estimates underlying the financial information presented below may provide investors with a helpful indication of the development of our results of operations following June 30, 2019. Our actual results for our first reporting period following the issuance of the Notes may differ materially from the trends included herein and may not be indicative of our future results. Such actual results remain subject to our normal review process, including the adjustments required to present this accounting information in accordance with IAS 34 (Interim Financial Reporting). Those procedures have not been completed. Because this information is preliminary, it is subject to change and those changes could be material. The information set forth below should not be regarded as an indication, forecast or representation regarding our financial results for the months of July and August, 2019 or for the year ending December 31, 2019. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a discussion of certain factors that could affect our future performance and results of operation._ Based on preliminary results derived from unaudited management monthly accounts and other information currently available, we estimate that our Group revenue for the two months July 2019 and August 2019 increased to approximately €65.1 million from approximately €62.5 million for the two months July 2018 and August 2018, representing an estimated increase of approximately 4% compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of products for agrochemicals applications within the Custom Manufacturing business unit particularly from our Kokkola site, partially offset by lower sales volumes for MCA in the Acetyls business unit as a result of a reduced output from our Knapsack site due to temporary repair work and summer shutdowns of some key customers in the Acetyls business unit. We estimate that our Group Adjusted EBITDA for the two months July 2019 and August 2019 increased to approximately €10.5 million from approximately €7.6 million for the two months July 2018 and August 2018, representing an estimated increase of approximately 37% compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of high margin products for agrochemicals applications within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, partially offset by the lower sales volume for MCA in the Acetyls business unit, as mentioned above. We estimate that Jayhawk revenues for the two months July 2019 and August 2019 increased to approximately $11.2 million from approximately $9.7 million for the two months July 2018 and August 2018, representing an estimated increase of approximately 15% compared to the same period in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by continuing high sales from our agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and specialities business, partially offset by lower specialty anhydrides sales. We estimate that Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA for the two months July 2019 and August 2019 increased to approximately $2.6 million from approximately $2.3 million for the two months July 2018 and August 2018, representing an estimated increase of approximately 12% compared to the same period in 2018 mainly due to a volume driven increase in revenues. 8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

(g) Run rate adjustments for our Custom Manufacturing business unit for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 include adjustments for the forecasted contribution from an increase in volumes of a product manufactured by Jayhawk (based on anticipated volumes and estimated prices), as a result of a customer’s increase in demand for the product due to a new technology developed by the customer utilizing this product. Run rate adjustments for our Custom Manufacturing business unit for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019 include adjustments for the forecasted contribution from: (i) a new product manufactured by the Group, based on anticipated volumes and the price we have contractually agreed with a customer; and (ii) an increase in volumes of a product manufactured by Jayhawk (based on anticipated volumes and estimated prices), as a result of a customer’s increase in demand for the product due to a new technology developed by the customer utilizing this product.

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,We are dependent on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue.,"We derive a substantial portion of our sales from several large customers. For the financial year ended December 31, 2018, our top six customers in our Custom Manufacturing business unit accounted for approximately 78% of the business unit’s total revenue (of which the top two accounted for approximately 56% of the business unit’s total revenue) and our top fifteen customers in our Acetyls business unit accounted for approximately 54% of the total revenue of the business unit. Our inability to maintain our customer relationships with key customers or otherwise retain their business at current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may lose customers because of, among other things, industry consolidation, customer dissatisfaction, competition or our customers’ products becoming obsolete. Our sales would be adversely affected if customers who currently outsource manufacturing of certain products to us decide to source such products internally or manufacture such products themselves. Since certain of our products are difficult and expensive to transport over long distances, if local or regional customers were no longer to buy such products, we may have difficulty finding replacement buyers, which could lead to a decrease in our sales. We supply certain customers without formal supply agreements, which results in lower switching costs for our customers and reduces our ability to predict our sales to such customers over a longer time-horizon. Several of our key customers require us to undergo a manufacturer certification process for new products in connection with the registration they undergo when registering a new product or formulation. This may involve an inspection by the customer’s own testing team of the product itself, focusing on quality testing, and of our manufacturing process by conducting plant audits. These manufacturer certifications are essential, because no sales to these customers can occur without such certifications. The testing is rigorous and can be time-consuming. We currently hold many certifications from key customers, but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience difficulty in obtaining new certifications as and when necessary. Failure to obtain such new certifications may result in the loss of such customers. Any loss of, or significant reduction in demand from, one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The agrochemicals industry is driven primarily by global trends, such as population growth resulting in increasing meat consumption, in particular in emerging markets, and requiring higher feed production to feed livestock, as well as the increased use of corn and sugarcane for biofuels. Since 2014, the agrochemicals market has declined considerably due to decreased crop commodity prices and subsequently lower net cash income for farmers, lower pest pressure and recession in South America. Such market trends, which are outside of our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. The pharmaceuticals industry is more directly affected by general economic conditions and real GDP. Changes in general economic conditions also directly impact consumer confidence and consumer spending as well as the general business climate and levels of business investment, all of which may directly affect our customers in the food, personal care and cosmetics industries and suppliers who operate in the PVC industry. 32 ----- Continued elevated levels of political and economic uncertainty, including increased trade protectionism, could have unpredictable consequences and may lead to a global economic downturn. In Europe, potential future changes to monetary policy, continued doubts about the future of the Eurozone (as well as questions about the European Union more generally in the wake of the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” referendum), insufficient deleveraging in the private and public sectors, a halt in implementing structural and financial reforms and an elevated level of political uncertainty could adversely affect our operations. In the United States, uncertainties associated with the policies pursued by the current administration, both nationally and internationally, have led to market volatility and political uncertainty, including most recently in connection with the implementation of trade tariffs and the risk of a “trade war” with China. Should such developments lead to a global economic downturn it may reduce demand for goods that incorporate our products and, in turn, our customers’ demand for our products, which would negatively impact our sales and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

These potential risks of disruption include, but are not necessarily limited to: - unplanned production or power disruptions; - failure of mechanical, process safety and pollution control equipment; - pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures; - explosions and fires; - inclement weather and natural disasters; - terrorist attacks; - political turmoil; - chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; - exposure to toxic chemicals; and - other accidents. These hazards could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations, expose employees, customers, the community and others to toxic chemicals and other hazards, contaminate the environment, damage property, result in personal injury or death, damage our reputation and adversely affect the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or our business operations as a whole, and result in the need for remediation, governmental enforcement, regulatory shutdowns, the imposition of government fines and penalties and claims brought by governmental entities or third parties. Legal claims and regulatory actions could subject us to both civil and criminal penalties, which could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability. We have comprehensive environmental, health and safety compliance and management systems to prevent potential risks and emergency response and crisis management plans in place to mitigate potential risks. If disruptions occur, alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take significant time to start production. Each of these scenarios could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. If any of our production facilities is unable to manufacture our products for an extended period of time, our sales may decline due to the disruption and we may not be able to manufacture sufficient volumes of products to meet our customers’ needs. For example, in 2018, we produced and delivered lower volumes of chlorine, caustic soda and chlorine co-products than contractually agreed with our customers due to the disruption caused by a defective cooling element sourced from a third-party provider. This disruption negatively impacted our EBITDA in the financial year ended December 31, 2018, only part of which was recovered in compensation. Any inability to recover from a third-party any or all of compensation related to a disruption could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, any inability to meet our customers’ needs could cause them to seek other suppliers. Furthermore, to the extent a disruption occurs at a production facility that has been operating at or near full capacity, the resulting shortage of our product 33 ----- could be particularly harmful because production at the facility may not be able to reach levels achieved prior to the disruption. For example, we experienced a transformer outage in 2018 at our plant in Switzerland which negatively impacted sales of our Custom Manufacturing business unit by approximately €6.4 million and negatively impacted Group Adjusted EBITDA by approximately €4.0 million. Further, shutdowns, strikes, weather or other disruptions affecting our upstream supply chain, such as our adjacent chlorine suppliers at our Knapsack and Jining Facilities, or our utilities or logistics providers, could have a negative impact on our business. There can be no assurance that such disruptions and the resulting repercussions will not adversely impact our reputation, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Many of our current contracts with customers allow us to pass on the majority of the cost of key raw materials typically with a time lag of three to six months. When our current contracts with customers expire, we may not be able to negotiate new contracts that allow us to pass costs of inputs on to our customers and this may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We obtain a significant portion of our raw materials in our Acetyls business unit, namely acetic acid, acetic anhydride and chlorine, from a limited number of suppliers. In certain exceptional cases, such as where the supply of raw materials to our production site requires a specific infrastructure such as a pipeline, we may also depend on a single supplier. For example, our plants in Knapsack and Jining depend on adjacent suppliers to supply chlorine via a pipeline. If any of our suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials and may not be able to increase prices for our products. Therefore, volatility in raw material prices or interruptions in supply could place increased pressure on our margins and reduce our cash flows. If we fail to maintain our relationships with our current suppliers, our suppliers offer pricing and other terms that are not satisfactory to us or a supplier fails to supply raw materials that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements, we may be unable to fill our customers’ orders on a timely and costeffective basis or in the required quantities, which could result in order cancellations, decreased sales or loss of market share and damage to our reputation. Each of these factors could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our business operations require our participation and reliance on contracts with customers, suppliers and other third-parties. Consequently, we may incur risks that deficiencies in those contracts, such as a misstatement or misapplication of a price formula, or any disagreement with respect to the interpretation of a price formula, could result in unintended effects on our business or financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

For the financial year ended December 31, 2018, our energy costs recognized in cost of sales amounted to €34.1 million, or 7.5% of our revenue. Energy costs are affected by various factors, including the availability of supplies of particular sources of energy, energy prices and regulatory decisions. In particular, prices for oil, gas and electricity have been volatile in recent years and such volatility may continue as a result of geopolitical instability. In addition, electricity prices for industrial consumers in Germany and Switzerland are generally higher than in several neighboring countries. Any significant increase in market prices, transportation costs, grid fees or taxes (including by reduction of tax benefits) associated with the supply of energy would increase our operating costs and, thus, may negatively affect our results of operations if we are not able to pass the increased costs on to our customers. Any deficiencies in our contracts with our customers, such as a misstatement or misapplication of a price formula, or any disagreement with respect to the interpretation of a price formula, could result in an inability to pass on increases in energy costs to our customers.

Changes in our customers’ products or processes may result in our customers reducing the volume of products they outsource to us or otherwise purchase from us, or even make our products unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative chemicals or processes that no longer require our products. For example, should a customer decide to use a different active ingredient or intermediate due to price, performance or other considerations, we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer’s new requirements. In some instances, we are the key supplier to our customers with respect to select key products. Consequently, the success of our products depends, to a significant extent, on the success of our customers’ own products in the relevant end-market. For example, if genetically modified organisms reduced or replaced the need for insecticides or other agrochemicals products, this could reduce demand for our customers’ end-products and, in turn, demand for our active ingredients and other products. We are also dependent on our customers’ continuous development of new products and need for our production and technical expertise.

As many of our products are critical to, or enhance the performance of, our customers’ applications and products, our customers rely on us for providing them with products that meet their specifications and quality requirements. Our quality control systems and in-process production controls provide for regular inspection of our products. However, there can be no assurance that our products will meet agreed specifications or quality requirements, will not contain impurities or be mistakenly co-mingled with other products (for example, due to mislabeling) when initially produced. In the past, prior to distribution to the customer, our controls have identified completed products which have failed to meet customer specifications. In such instances, we have been required to re-run the manufacturing process to achieve the proper specifications, which has resulted in loss of revenue due to the need to deliver replacements at our own expense, reduction in sales volume due to the loss of diverted production capacity and delayed delivery of product to customers. Our contracts with our customers require our products to meet agreed specifications or quality requirements and therefore we may face similar consequences if we fail to detect such quality deficiencies in the first instance or otherwise deliver products which do not meet these requirements. In the event our quality systems identify issues only after shipping, we could further face the possibility of a recall, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial additional work or destruction of material.

We continue to focus on efficiency improvement initiatives to optimize our asset base, improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategies or that implementing these strategies will sustain or improve, and not harm, our results of operations. In particular, we may not be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency or asset utilization or achieve other cost savings, such as the operational efficiency measures we are currently implementing in our Swiss and German production facilities. In addition, the costs involved in implementing our strategies may be greater than we currently anticipate. For example, our ability to complete capacity expansions in our production facilities in Europe and in China may be delayed or interrupted by the need to obtain environmental and other regulatory approvals, the availability of labor and materials, unforeseen hazards, such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Moreover, the capital expenditure that we estimate for use in such capacity expansion projects may be insufficient to cover the actual cost. We may experience cost overruns, and the cost of capacity expansion projects could have a negative impact on our financial results until capacity utilization is sufficiently high to absorb the incremental costs associated with the expansion. Furthermore, our production processes and supply chains are highly integrated and any disruptions to such production processes or supply chains may negatively impact the sales of our product. For example, we experienced a transformer outage at our Pratteln site in 2018 which affected not only our custom manufacturing business unit but also, as a result of our integrated production network, our acetyls business unit. As the production of one of the key intermediates manufactured at the Pratteln site depends on MCA sourced from our Knapsack and Gersthofen facilities, we were required to divert sales of this MCA, at reduced prices, to other customers during the outage due to the reduced demand at Pratteln while production capacity was down. Our business strategies, in particular our production capacity expansion plans, are based on assumptions about future demand for our products and on our ability to optimize utilization of our existing and future production facilities. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our strategy of optimizing utilization of assets in accordance with our plans or at all. For example, the frequency and length of facility maintenance and turnarounds (scheduled outages of a production facility in order to perform necessary inspections, tests to comply with industry regulations and any maintenance activities that may be necessary) and unplanned outages have had, and may in the future have, an impact on our operating results.

For example, PCC Rokita in Poland entered the European market in 2016, leading to increased supply in the market and downward pressure on prices. We may face increased competition in the future from other potential new entrants in our markets. Competition is based on several key criteria, including technology and technological capabilities, product quality, innovation and performance, production capacity, price, geography and security of supply and responsiveness to product development in cooperation with customers. Some of our competitors are larger than we are, may have greater financial resources and may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry, fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and energy and changes in general economic conditions. Additionally, competitors’ pricing decisions could compel us to lower our prices, which could adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Further, our competitors may undertake to expand their production capacity, which could lead to a shift in supply and negative pricing impacts on our products. For example, in 2018 PCC Rokita announced that it would more than double its production capacity of MCA. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume, focusing on higher margin chemical products and improving efficiency 36 ----- of operations through innovation.

Further, seasonal fluctuations including adverse weather conditions may adversely affect certain of our markets and customers. For example, in early 2019 severe North American weather conditions led to a temporary downturn due to limited crop planting in that region. In addition, we and other chemical companies, including certain of our suppliers and customers, generally schedule repairs of machinery and production facility turnarounds (scheduled shutdowns of production units or facilities for maintenance) in the summer months, which may result in lower sales in the second and particularly the third quarters relative to the first and fourth quarters of a given year.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

We are highly regulated and may incur significant costs to maintain compliance with, or address liabilities under, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business.","Like other chemical producers, we are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate or do business, including those governing licenses and permits, air emissions, energy efficiency, water discharge, the use, management, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, the protection and restoration of plants, wildlife, natural resources and public health and safety, product safety and content, the investigation and remediation of contaminated land, and worker and product related health and safety, as well as numerous related reporting and record keeping requirements. See “Regulation, Environmental, Health and Safety _Matters.”_ In addition, we are required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in relation to our production and distribution processes, and the relevant regulatory authorities carry out regular inspections to ascertain our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. The demands of compliance may require us to incur substantial costs, including capital requirements, cleanup costs, fines or penalties, and/or may restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably, and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also lead to public reprimand, fines or other sanctions, loss of sales and damage to our goodwill and reputation. Further, such laws and regulations are subject to change, often become stricter with time, and may result in substantial additional future compliance costs. We cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, the European Directive No. 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions (“IED Directive”) sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities and includes rules aimed at reducing emissions into air, water and land, as well as preventing the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall environmental protection. Although the IED Directive and its implementation provide transitional provisions, once a new industry standard becomes binding, existing permits, which are not in compliance with such standard can become invalid. We have in the past incurred, and will in the future incur, significant cost for capital and operating expenditures to obtain and maintain necessary permits. However, we cannot ensure that we will also in the future be able to obtain and finance all permits which we require for our business operations. Any such failure or any violation of the terms and conditions of such permits or revocation of existing permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our results of operations are also influenced by the evolving nature of regulations impacting the industries in which our customers operate. In particular, certain customers in our Custom Manufacturing business unit produce pharmaceuticals subject to good manufacturing process (“GMP”) requirements. GMP requirements have become increasingly more extensive and complex and as a result of these increased requirements, we made a strategic decision to phase out our services and products in the pharmaceuticals sector that require GMP procedures, which as a consequence contributed to a decrease in our revenue for the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.

Our inability to maintain our existing classification registration in member states of the European Union under the REACH legislation, or comparable legislation in other countries in which we operate or do business, may affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain products.","To operate a chemical manufacturing business and to sell and distribute chemical products involves safety health and environmental risks. As part of our business, we store, handle, transport and use certain substances or components that may be considered toxic or hazardous. If operational risks—such as fires, leaks, releases and explosions—materialize, they could result in injury or loss of life, damage to the environment or loss of production. This may in turn make it difficult to meet customer needs and, 42 ----- therefore, may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We must comply with a broad range of regulations related to the testing, manufacturing, registration, labeling and safety analysis of our products or the products of our suppliers. In some countries, including the Member States of the European Union, these types of regulatory controls and restrictions have become increasingly demanding and we expect this trend to continue. For example, our products and raw materials produced or imported into the European Union are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analysis of the substances contained in them. The European Union Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006), (“REACH”), imposes significant obligations on the chemicals industry as a whole with respect to the testing, evaluation, assessment and registration of basic chemicals and chemical intermediates. The review and update of existing registrations are expensive and time consuming and lead to increased production costs and reduced operating margins for chemical products. We also cannot exclude with certainty that the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) may not designate some of our other products as “substances of very high concern” and thereby require authorization and a strict safety evaluation for them under REACH. Moreover, under the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012 we have to apply for approval of active substances at ECHA and for product authorization before placing a biocidal product on the market. In connection with REACH or the EU Classification, Labeling and Packaging Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008), some key raw materials, chemical or substance, including our products, could be reclassified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, on users of our products, or on our employees. In addition, the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) mandates that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) conduct safety evaluations for all chemicals in active commerce and require new chemicals and significant new uses of chemicals to be deemed likely to be safe before entering the market. With respect to any facilities we operate or may operate in the United States, and with respect to any products we sell or may in the future sell in the United States, classification or reclassification of one or more of our raw materials or products could affect our ability to manufacture or market our products, result in a ban on purchase or sale of our products or raw materials, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification, labelling, handling, or other requirements. These and other regulatory requirements affecting our products that have been adopted or may be adopted in future could negatively affect the availability or marketability of the raw materials or products we use, result in a restriction or ban on their purchase or sale, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification labelling or handling requirements. Because some of these regulations have only recently been enacted or proposed, we are not in a position to predict with certainty their expected cost impact with specificity. In addition, as some of our products are sold into markets in which the correct classification is at the discretion of the legal regime applicable to those substances, we cannot exclude that competent authorities or third parties could question or contest our classification.

Changes in the law or the price of emission allowances, or other climate related regulatory requirements, may affect our business.","In the European Union, regulations attempt to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to establish a mechanism for trading in carbon dioxide emission allowances. Under the EU Emission Trading System (“ETS”), the overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge has been significantly reduced for the second trading and third trading periods (2008 through 2012 and 2013 through 2020). The quantity of such emission allowances are generally reduced from 80% of total allowances in 2013 to 30% in 2020. Starting with the third trading period, there are no longer any national allocation plans, but an EU-wide cap set by the European Commission and uniform allocation rules for all member states. Under the currently applicable ETS, the EU-wide cap is lowered annually by a linear factor of 1.74% of the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU in the second trading period. Beginning in the fourth trading period (2021-2030), the cap will be lowered by 2.2% per year to achieve the target of cutting EU emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2030, as agreed upon by the European Council in October 2014 as part of the 2030 climate and energy framework. In addition, from 2013 onwards, the auctioning of emission allowances has been introduced for the manufacturing sector. Although we have not been required to date to acquire emission allowances for our covered operations, as the amount of our emissions does not exceed the thresholds that cause the applicability of the ETS, we cannot predict with certainty whether those thresholds may not be decreased and/or what applicable thresholds in the future may be. If we were required in the future to purchase emission allowances in the amount required for our production purposes, it could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the United States, the EPA is engaged in ongoing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) rulemaking. In light of legislative and judicial challenges to EPA action, significant uncertainty currently exists as to how GHG regulations will in the future impact large stationary sources, including any facilities we operate or in the future may operate in the United States, and what costs or operational changes these regulations may require. In addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a significant number of U.S. states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, including through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG gas cap-and-trade programs. It is difficult to predict the form for such regulation that the U.S. Congress or U.S. states may adopt in the future (such as a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such requirements. For example, with respect to facilities we operate or may operate in the United States, we could be required to install emissions control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer and manage our GHG emissions program, or address other regulatory obligations, which may adversely impact our operations and financial condition. Additional future regulation of GHGs in the United States could result from future international treaty obligations, regulatory changes under the CAA or other existing legislation, or federal, state or regional adoption of GHG regulatory schemes.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements.

In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration 47 ----- of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture provides a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer could cause an independent financial advisor to determine an appropriate successor rate, and make certain adjustments to such rate, including applying a spread thereon to make such successor rate substantially comparable to EURIBOR, which upon certification by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to each of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation to the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee. This would mean that interest on the Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial advisor, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any.

Following the Completion Date, we expect the directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuers and the non-U.S. Guarantors to be non-residents of the United States, and substantially all of their assets will be located outside the United States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers and the non-U.S. Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Germany, Finland, Luxembourg and Switzerland. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Germany, Finland, Luxembourg and Switzerland of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in Germany, Finland, Luxembourg and Switzerland of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in Germany, Finland, Luxembourg or Switzerland would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations.

The OECD published its final reports in relation to its Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) on October 5, 2015, which were endorsed at the G20 summit in November 2015, and the multilateral instrument to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent BEPS was published on November 24, 2016. As part of this commitment, an Action Plan has been developed to address BEPS with the aim of securing tax revenue by realigning taxation with economic activities and value creation by creating a single set of consensus based international tax rules. As part of the BEPS project, new rules dealing with the operation of double tax treaties, the definition of permanent establishments, interest deductibility and the taxation of hybrid instruments and hybrid entities have already been introduced and will continue to be introduced in relevant tax legislation of participating OECD countries. Depending on if and how these proposals are implemented, they may result in material changes to tax laws which can impact the tax treatment of income and gains arising at the level of the Issuers, intermediate companies and portfolio companies, which may adversely impact how the returns to investors are taxed Such implementation may also give rise to additional reporting and disclosure obligations for the Issuers, intermediate companies, and investors. As part of the global OECD BEPS project, Luxembourg has signed (together with 88 jurisdictions) the so-called multilateral instrument (“MLI”) that will transpose anti-BEPS measures into some of the treaties that Luxembourg has concluded. Luxembourg ratified the MLI through the law dated March 7, 2019 and has deposited its instrument of ratification on April 9, 2019 with the OECD. As a result, the MLI will enter into force in Luxembourg on August 1, 2019 for double tax treaties concluded with countries which would also deposit their ratification instruments before the end of April 2019 (such as, among others, Austria, France, Guernsey, Ireland, Jersey, Malta, Netherlands and the United Kingdom). For all countries which ratify the MLI after Luxembourg, its dates of application should be calculated on an individual basis. The MLI notably introduces a “principal purpose test” (“PPT”) denying tax treaty benefits to companies when obtaining such benefits was “one of the principle purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in” these benefits, unless granting these benefits under the given circumstances would be “in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions” of the tax treaty. Whether a Luxembourg entity relying on tax treaty benefits can be construed as being part of such type of arrangement will predominantly depend on source state views.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The ATAD 1 grants EU member states certain options in the implementation of the directive into their domestic laws. Luxembourg implemented the ATAD 1 into its national law effective January 1, 2019, while exit taxation provisions will apply as from January 1, 2020. On February 21, 2017, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the EU reached political agreement on amendments to ATAD 1 to neutralize hybrid mismatch structures involving non-EU countries (Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of 29 May 2017, “ATAD 2”). While ATAD 1 contains rules combatting certain hybrid mismatches between EU Member States, ATAD 2 introduces more detailed rules to neutralize hybrid mismatched and extends the scope to (i) a variety of other mismatches between EU Member States and (ii) mismatches between EU Member States and third countries. The more extensive anti-hybrid rules in the ATAD 2 replace the initial rules to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements set out in the ATAD 1. ATAD 2 provisions must be implemented by EU Member States into domestic law by December 31, 2019, such that the rules apply no later than January 1, 2020. As an exception, implementation of a specific provision targeting so-called reverse hybrids can be postponed by EU Member States until December 31, 2021, and applicable by January 1, 2022. 62 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The Contribution will be completed on or about the Issue Date, but in any event, within five business days following the Issue Date. We expect to commence the liquidation of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. in 2020, which would leave its direct subsidiary, Kansas HoldCo, Inc., as a direct subsidiary of CABB Europe GmbH. The Target consists of Monitchem Kansas S.à r.l. and its subsidiaries, including Jayhawk, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals products with a production facility in Galena, Kansas in the United States. The Contribution will provide us with an established platform for operations in the U.S. specialty chemicals market, a segment and geography in which we currently only have a presence by way of our sales office in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Contribution will also provide us with an existing base of customers and contracts in the region. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, Jayhawk generated revenues of $22.4 million and $26.4 million and Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 million and $5.9 million, respectively. For the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, Jayhawk generated revenues of $51.4 million and $50.8 million and Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 million and $11.9 million, respectively. For the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, Jayhawk made capital expenditures of $7.8 million (of which $4.9 million was related to maintenance and $2.9 million was related to expansion) and $6.6 million (of which $3.5 million was related to maintenance and $3.1 million was related to expansion), respectively. For the financial year ended December 31, 2018, Jayhawk’s specialty anhydrides business accounted for approximately 46% of its revenues and Jayhawk’s custom manufacturing business accounted for approximately 54% of its revenues. Jayhawk’s end-market exposure is complementary to ours and includes industries such as specialties, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (representing approximately 65%, 19% and 16% of Jayhawk revenues in 2018, respectively). On a regional basis, Jayhawk derived approximately 62% of its revenue from North America, 19% from the EMEA region and 19% from Asia in 2018. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, Jayhawk had an average of 120 employees. While Jayhawk has maintained levels of net working capital that amount to approximately half its sales in each of the financial years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 and the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019, we believe this is primarily due to the stocking of a key product with high margins.

As a result, Jayhawk, as a lessee, has recognized right-of-use assets representing its right to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments. Under the modified retrospective approach, the cumulative effect of initial application is recognized in accumulated deficit at January 1, 2019. At January 1, 2019, the right-of-use asset equaled the lease liability. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated.

They are to a large extent used in agrochemical and pharmaceutical applications, but also in other diverse end-uses such as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and dyestuffs for textile application. Our Acetyls business unit focuses on the production of monochloroacetic acid, or MCA, acetyl derivatives and co-products, which have a variety of applications in the agrochemicals, food, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. MCA, the business unit’s main product, accounted for 61% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. Derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid and trichloroacetic acid, accounted for 19% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and accounted for 20% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. The end uses for our agrochemicals are spread across a number of crops, with 46% of agrochemicals revenue attributable to corn, 9% to cereal, 6% to soy, 5% to food and vegetables and 34% to other products for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Agrochemicals revenue are also spread across different applications, with 68% attributable to herbicide applications, 29% to fungicides and 3% to insecticides for the same period. Following the Contribution, we believe we would be the second largest European custom manufacturing supplier in the global agrochemicals market by sales. We are also one of the four principal suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas. Our key agrochemicals customers are active in a structurally growing global market driven by population growth, improving living standards and changing dietary trends, especially in emerging markets, as well as growing demand for biofuels and yield improvements. We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from positive long-term growth trends in the agrochemicals market and are investing in capacity and yield improvement to support the growth of our business. 71 ----- Headquartered in Germany, we operate production facilities in Germany, Switzerland, Finland and China. In Custom Manufacturing, we operate two large production facilities, in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland). In Acetyls, we operate three technologically-advanced production facilities: in Gersthofen and Knapsack (Germany) and in Jining, Shandong Province (China) through our majority-owned joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd. We benefit from the cost advantage of operating large-scale, highly integrated production facilities strategically located near key customers and suppliers as well as transportation networks. For the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019, we generated total revenue of €470.6 million and Group Adjusted EBITDA of €93.8 million, while Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $12.6 million and Combined Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €104.8 million. For the same period, our Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls business units accounted for 60.6% and 39.4% of our total revenue, respectively.

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Industry Overview,17.2.1,,"The global agrochemicals industry has been one of the main drivers of agricultural productivity increases over the past decades. Industry research firm Phillips McDougall estimates that the global crop protection industry accounted for approximately $57.6 billion in sales in 2018, having grown at a CAGR of 2.9% per annum from 2016 to 2018. The growth of custom manufacturing is driven by the major global agrochemicals players’ use of outsourcing as a source of additional production capacity in order to serve the steadily increasing global demand for agrochemicals. In recent years, agrochemicals companies have allocated a larger share of production to external custom manufacturers, which provide flexible multi-purpose and multi-product capacity. Outsourcing reduces agrochemical companies’ asset intensity, limits the risks associated with large, upfront investments and allows them to deploy capital with a stronger focus on their core capabilities, such as research and development as well as marketing and distribution. This trend is supported by new molecules becoming increasingly complex and more active, often based on multi-step synthesis, which requires demanding technical capabilities. Custom manufacturers typically work in close co-operation and often on an exclusive or near-exclusive basis for select products with agrochemical companies in order to set up scalable manufacturing units and efficient production processes. This production know-how, combined with often lengthy product registration, generally results in low customer churn and high contract renewal rates in custom manufacturing. For Acetyls, according to Tecnon OrbiChem, the global MCA market in 2018 was approximately 1.867kt. Global MCA trade flows are often characterized by regional supply and demand due to the corrosive nature of MCA and relatively high transportation costs, which encourages proximity to customers. CABB and Nouryon (formerly Akzo Nobel) are currently the only large-scale producers of high-purity grade MCA, which is mostly used in developed markets and has high-end applications.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.3.1,Development of the agrochemicals market,"With our strong focus on custom manufacturing of active ingredients and advanced intermediates for the agrochemicals industry, our results of operations are affected by changes in the global agrochemicals market and the demand for our products by our customers. Our customers include four of the top five global agrochemicals companies. According to the industry research firm Phillips McDougall, the top five global agrochemicals companies accounted for approximately 61% of the global agrochemicals market by revenue in 2018. From 2008 to 2018, the crop protection market grew at a CAGR of 2.9% per annum from $43.2 billion to $57.6 billion, supported by structural global trends including global population growth, increasing meat consumption, in particular in emerging markets, and increased use of corn and sugar cane for biofuels. However, since 2014, the agrochemicals market has declined considerably due to decreased crop commodity prices and subsequently lower net cash income, lower pest pressure and recession in South America. Agrochemicals such as herbicides, fungicides and insecticides, for which we supply advanced intermediates and active ingredients, play an essential role in crop protection and result in higher productivity per acre (higher crop yields). In 2018, herbicides, the biggest single market in crop protection, accounted for approximately 43% of the global conventional crop protection market by sales; 72 ----- in 2018, a significant majority of sales in our Custom Manufacturing business unit also related to products used in the production of herbicides. Fungicides accounted for approximately 28% and insecticides approximately 25% of the global market by sales in 2018, and a similar proportion of sales of our Custom Manufacturing unit is also from fungicide applications. Given our strategic focus on customized products for the agrochemicals industry and our strategic supplier status with four of the top five global agrochemicals companies, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.3.2,"Volume, product mix and pricing","Production volumes and margins are important variables of our results of operations and critical to maintaining and enhancing our profitability. We believe we occupy strong market positions in both business units, being among the top two custom manufacturing players in the European agrochemicals market by sales after giving effect to the Contribution and one of the four principal suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas. These market dynamics contribute to attractive margins across our product portfolio. The primary products we manufacture in our Custom Manufacturing business unit are used in the production of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. Demand for these agrochemicals, and therefore the volumes that we sell, may vary from year to year based on weather conditions in different parts of the world and prevailing crop prices, which in turn impact our absolute margins in our Custom Manufacturing business unit. However, as our key agrochemicals customers are active on a global scale and our sales to them are typically based on longer-term contracts of three to five years, we believe we enjoy good visibility on future sales across the product portfolio. Moreover, custom manufacturing is a service business. Many of our products are tailored to an individual customer’s specific requirements based on its intellectual property and, therefore, critical to the production or performance of our customers’ products. We benefit from the critical nature of certain of our exclusive active ingredients and advanced intermediates to the performance of our customers’ products as well as our high integration into our customers’ value chain, including often being the key supplier of certain key products. In our Acetyls business unit, which is characterized by a number of products each sold to a range of customers, our business operations are generally more influenced by the balance of supply and demand and plant utilization rates, which, in 2018, were 84%, 96% and 66%, respectively, for our Knapsack, Gersthofen and Shandong production facilities. Historically, demand for MCA has grown broadly in line with GDP in Europe across various end-markets, which has contributed to our utilization rates. Furthermore, proximity to customers and supply chain expertise are critical due to relatively high transportation costs of distributing MCA. We generate a significant majority of our sales of MCA from customers in Europe, where we are one of three principal producers, and in the Americas, which lacks a sizeable MCA producer for the merchant market. Our results of operations are also influenced by the price of caustic soda, which is produced by our chlor-alkali electrolysis process, the price of which has fluctuated significantly in the past. For example, in 2017, the average price we realized for caustic soda was €427 per ton, compared to €622 per ton in 2018. In the first half of 2018, the average price we realized was €612 per ton compared to €625 per ton in the first half of 2019. Caustic soda is sold to a large commodity market, which is mainly driven by capacity utilization of the PVC industry producing chlorine and where we have limited influence on the market price. In 2018, we sold approximately 46 kt of caustic soda. Similar to MCA, the transportation costs for the distribution of caustic soda are relatively high, thereby limiting the sale of caustic soda to customers in close proximity to the production facility, typically within 300 kilometers.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.3.3,Raw materials,"Raw material and energy prices are key components of our cost of sales and therefore significantly affect our gross profit, particularly in our Acetyls business unit. The main raw materials in Acetyls are acetic acid, acetic anhydride and chlorine, representing 60%, 21% and 9% of MCA sales, respectively. Approximately half of our Acetyls customer contracts by sales include price formulas that allow for an effective pass-through of price variations in acetic acid and, to a lesser extent, acetic anhydride. These pass-through provisions help to limit significant fluctuations in our cost of sales but typically include a time lag of up to three months. In 2013, we diversified our supplier base of acetic acid by testing and qualifying new suppliers in order to source at more competitive prices and reduce our dependency on a single source who had previously supplied us with the majority of our annual consumption of acetic acid. In Gersthofen, we produce chlorine for captive use in our chlor-alkali electrolysis based on membrane technology, which primarily requires salt and electricity as input factors. As a substantial electricity consumer, we have been 73 ----- largely exempt from the EEG-levy at our Gersthofen facility’s electrolysis plant and at our Knapsack plant, which may not be available to us in the future. At our Knapsack and Jining facilities, we source chlorine via pipeline under supply contracts from suppliers whose chlorine production facilities are adjacent to our plants, leading to efficiencies for both companies that would be difficult to replace. In our Custom Manufacturing business unit, raw materials for production are to a significant extent either provided by our customers and, therefore, not recorded in our cost of sales, or customer contracts include pass-through clauses to protect against fluctuations in prices of raw materials, helping to protect against margin fluctuations. For example, approximately 95% of sales from our top 14 agrochemicals exclusives products in Custom Manufacturing for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 were not exposed to raw material price fluctuations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

However, we need to schedule shutdowns of our facilities from time to time in order to carry out required maintenance activities, perform necessary inspections and tests or accommodate for shutdowns of key suppliers, such as our suppliers of chlorine in Knapsack and Jining. We refer to these scheduled outages as turnarounds. The number and length of such turnarounds carried out in any given period impact our operating results and the level of our capital expenditures. Our production facilities undergo regular maintenance which requires the outage of a production unit or the entire facility for a period of two to four weeks. Repair and maintenance costs in connection with such regular maintenance can be up to several millions. Our Gersthofen facility underwent a regular maintenance turnaround in 2016 and is scheduled to undergo its next turnaround of approximately three weeks in December 2019. Our Knapsack facility and adjacent chlorine supplier completed a scheduled maintenance turnaround in May 2019 and are scheduled to undergo their next maintenance turnaround of approximately two weeks in April 2020. Our Pratteln production unit regularly has turnaround phases for parts or all of the plant which can last from one day to several weeks. Our Jining facility and adjacent chlorine supplier completed a one-week maintenance turnaround at the end of May 2019 and are scheduled to undergo their next maintenance turnaround of approximately one week in summer 2020. In our Custom Manufacturing multi-purpose plants, where a significant portion of the products we manufacture are customized for a specific customer, we need to factor in ‘switch-over’ times to clean the reactor vessels when changing production from one product to another in multi-purpose facilities.

Further, seasonal fluctuations including adverse weather conditions may adversely affect certain of our markets and customers. For example, in early 2019 severe North American weather conditions led to a temporary downturn due to limited crop planting in that region. In addition, we and other chemical companies, including certain suppliers and customers, generally schedule repairs of machinery and facility turnarounds (scheduled shutdowns of production units or facilities for maintenance) in the summer months, which may result in lower sales in the second and third quarters relative to the first and fourth quarters of a given year.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The review revealed that the separation criteria of an embedded derivative have been applicable in the financial statements since 2014. As a consequence, we recognized embedded derivatives related to early redemption options in the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not consider the effect of this separation to be a material error with respect to the financial statements adjustment for the financial year ended December 31, 2017, nor for any of the financial statements prior to 2017; however, in order to increase transparency and to provide better communication to the markets, the errors have been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior years 2015 and 2016 by applying IAS 8.42 et seq. by analogy in the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Group applied IAS 18 until December 31, 2017. According to IAS 18, revenues are recognized when products are delivered or services are rendered and when ownership and risks have been transferred to the purchaser. The revenues comprise the fair value received for the sale of products and services, excluding sales taxes and taxes on consumption, less discounts and price reductions and after the elimination of internal sales with our Group. The Group applied IFRS 15 for the first time as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. According to IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when control of the agreed-upon goods or services and the benefits obtainable from them are transferred to the customer. The transfer of major risks and rewards of ownership of the goods is only one deciding factor amongst others. Revenue is 75 ----- measured at the amount of consideration specified in contracts with customers for goods and services. The new model for the determination of revenue recognition is based on five steps, whereby the contract with the customer and the individual performance obligations within the contract are initially identified. The transaction price is then determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract. Finally, revenue is recognized for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service is provided and the customer gains control. Within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, revenues for the exclusives product group are recognized over time; for certain contracts within the exclusives product group, the performance obligation consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities in exchange of a remuneration, which is classified as a “stand ready obligation”.

The increase in revenue was primarily due to a strong performance in both business units. Revenue in our Custom Manufacturing business unit increased by €14.9 million, or 11.2%, from €133.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €148.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to strong sales volumes of new agrochemical products in combination with strong demand for existing products. Sales of intermediates increased compared to the prior year, which was mainly driven by a different sales pattern and supported by continuous high caustic soda prices. Sales of specialties increased compared to prior year, due to a strong demand for existing products, while sales of our pharmaceutical products remained below prior year mainly as a result of a product phasing out in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. Revenue in our Acetyls business unit increased by €3.2 million, or 3.2%, from €98.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €101.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to sales in the MCA product group increasing on the back of positive pricing effects from the passing on of higher raw material prices incurred in prior periods with a time lag via a price formula and a strong demand throughout Europe and the Americas across all product categories. Sales of the derivatives product group increased compared to prior year due to positive pricing effects. Sales of co-products slightly decreased, mainly driven by lower volumes due to seasonality and phasing effects. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by €9.0 million, or 5.1%, from €176.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €185.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by higher sales volumes in our Custom Manufacturing business unit, rising energy costs and an increase in the cost of labor resulting from a new collective bargaining agreement in Germany, which were partially offset by lower costs of raw materials in the MCA product group. _Gross Profit_ Gross profit increased by €8.0 million, or 16.8%, from €47.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €55.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a strong performance in both business units, including positive effects from stable production in our Custom Manufacturing business unit. _Research and Development Expenses_ Research and development expenses remained unchanged, at €1.4 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019. _Distribution and Logistics Expenses_ Distribution and logistics expenses increased by €1.6 million, or 5.3%, from €30.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €31.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The increase in distribution and logistics expenses was primarily driven by higher volumes in South America, where our distribution and logistics expenses are greater. _General and Administrative Expenses_ General and administrative expenses decreased by €1.4 million, or 11.7%, from €12.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €10.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower non-recurring expenses incurred in conjunction with changes in the personnel composition of management functions. _Financial Result_ Financial result amounted to a net cost of €17.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, an increase of €0.1 million, from a net cost of €17.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018. Interest income and similar stayed flat at nil for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019. Interest expense and similar remained relatively stable at €19.7 million and €19.9 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, respectively. Other financial expenses decreased from €0.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €nil for the six-month period ended 78 ----- June 30, 2019. The decrease in financial expenses was primarily driven by a smaller decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivatives related to early redemption options of the Existing Notes. Other financial income increased from €0.2 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €0.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to the expiration of an interest rate swap. Foreign currency gains decreased from €2.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €1.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. _Taxes on Income_ Taxes on income decreased by €1.3 million, from a tax income of €0.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to a tax expense of €0.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in taxes on income was primarily due to a higher taxable income in Switzerland. _Net Profit (Loss) for the Period_ Due to the factors discussed above, net loss for the period decreased by €6.4 million, from a net loss of €12.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to a net loss of €6.1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. Net loss attributable to our shareholders decreased by €6.0 million from a loss of €11.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to a loss of €5.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019 and the non-controlling interest decreased by €0.3 million from a loss of €0.8 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to a loss of €0.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Comparability of 2018 financial information to prior year is ensured by a like-for-like presentation. 2018 like-for-like financial information has been adjusted, while 2017 like-for-like financial information is the same as that reported in the 2017 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and does not include any adjustments. See Note 5 of the 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to transition effects on our segment information. For the financial year ended December 31, 2018, including the effect of IFRS 15, revenue in our Custom Manufacturing segment were €271.9 million, revenue in our Acetyls segment were €197.5 million and inter-segment eliminations were €(15.8) million, resulting in total revenue of €453.6 million. (2) Represents predominantly sales of MCA from the Acetyls business unit to the Custom Manufacturing business unit. Revenue increased by €11.4 million, or 2.6%, from €442.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €453.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 on a like-for-like basis, primarily due to increased revenue in the Acetyls business unit, which were partly offset by decreased revenue in the Custom Manufacturing business unit. Revenue in our Custom Manufacturing business unit decreased by €4.3 million, or 1.6%, from €276.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €271.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 on a like-for-like basis. Revenue of agrochemical products declined moderately in comparison to the prior year, due to the timing of customer campaigns and the phase out of a specific product. Revenue of specialties products decreased compared to the prior year, due to overall lower demand in a more competitive market. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in revenue of intermediates products, mainly driven by price increases for caustic soda. As the production of certain intermediates depends on the overall production volume within the integrated production network (Verbund) in Pratteln, revenue of these products partially stayed below their potential, as they were impacted by lower output due to the transformer outage in the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue of our pharmaceutical products remained flat, despite lower demand from a blue-chip pharma customer. Revenue in our Acetyls business unit increased by €18.0 million, or 10.0% from €179.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €197.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 on a like-for-like basis. This increase was primarily a result of strong demand within our European markets across all product categories of derivatives and the MCA product group. Revenue of co-products increased as the phase out of mercury cell technology led to reduced production capacities and thus increased prices on selective products, such as caustic soda. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by €8.1 million, or 2.3%, from €350.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €358.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, mainly due to an increase of €9.1 million in costs of raw materials and supplies primarily as a result of an increase in sales volume within our Acetyls business unit and an increase in raw material prices for our MCA product group. This €9.1 million increase was partly offset by a €0.9 million decrease related to the transition to IFRS 15. _Gross Profit_ Gross profit increased by €3.5 million, or 3.8%, from €92.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €95.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to 80 ----- volume driven revenue increase within the Acetyls business unit. In addition, the transition to the new IFRS accounting standards increased gross profit for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 by €1.1 million. _Research and Development Expenses_ Research and development expenses increased by €0.3 million from €2.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €2.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a higher annual average number of employees in this division. _Distribution and Logistics Expenses_ Distribution and logistics expenses increased by €1.0 million, or 1.7%, from €59.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €60.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in distribution and logistics expenses was primarily attributable to higher depreciation and amortization costs, partly offset by lower transport costs. _General and Administrative Expenses_ General and administrative expenses decreased by €1.5 million, or 6.5%, from €23.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €21.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower non-recurring items, partly offset by an increase in legal and consultancy costs and higher personnel expenses. _Other Income_ Other income decreased by €0.5 million from €0.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €0.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. This was due to the recognition of the sale of all shares of CABB (India) Ltd. in 2017, by which sale we divested our former manufacturing site in India. _Other Expenses_ Other expenses decreased by €4.1 million from €4.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €0.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, due to the recognition in 2017 of impairment losses relating to the disposal of our manufacturing site in India and to the total impairment of a cash generating unit within our Chinese subsidiary. _Financial Result_ Financial result amounted to a net expense of €33.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of €21.7 million, or 39.1%, from a net expense of €55.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 mainly due to an improvement of the net foreign currency result, which increased by €19.6 million from a net loss of €14.2 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to a net gain of €5.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income and similar decreased slightly from €0.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €0.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense and similar increased by €0.6 million from €39.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €39.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by an increase in interest expenses on lease liabilities due to the transition to the new IFRS 16 accounting standard (€0.3 million), and by higher charges resulting from the amortization of transaction costs recognized over the term of the Existing Notes (€0.2 million). Other financial income remained unchanged. Other financial expenses decreased by €2.7 million, primarily due to a smaller decrease in the fair value of early redemption options of the Existing Notes. _Taxes on Income_ Taxes on income decreased by €5.5 million from a tax income of €6.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to a tax income of €0.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in taxes on income was primarily due to the impact of financial expenses, which are subject to restrictions under thin capitalization rules, for which no deferred tax assets are recognized. _Net Profit (Loss) for the Period_ Due to the factors discussed above, net loss for the period decreased by €23.4 million, from a net loss of €45.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to a net loss of €22.1 million for the financial 81 ----- year ended December 31, 2018. Net loss attributable to our shareholders decreased by €23.4 million from a loss of €44.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of €20.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 and the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests remained relatively stable at €1.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 and €1.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Revenue decreased by €5.7 million, or 1.3%, from €447.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €442.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to decreased sales in the Custom Manufacturing business unit, which were partly offset by increased sales in the Acetyls business unit. 82 ----- Revenue in our Custom Manufacturing business unit decreased by €14.2 million, or 4.9%, from €290.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €276.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in each of our product segments. Sales of agrochemical products decreased due to lower demand for selected products, impacted by a continued weak market environment driven by high agricultural commodity stock levels, low crop prices and reduced farmer incomes. Sales were further negatively impacted by a product phase out and a temporary closure of a railway track used to transport our products in mid-August to early October, impacting our and our customers’ production and hence sales volumes. Sales of pharmaceutical products decreased compared to the prior year, due to lower demand and a product phase out. Sales of specialties decreased compared to the prior year, due to a lower demand for an active ingredient for the detergent market. Sales of intermediates decreased year-on-year, due to a different product portfolio mix as well as lower production volume of certain intermediates, as these are dependent on the overall production volume within the integrated production network (Verbund) in Pratteln. Revenue in our Acetyls business unit increased by €7.4 million, or 4.3% from €172.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €179.5 million, primarily as a result of strong demand throughout Europe, with sales in all product segments increasing compared to the prior year. Co-products performed particularly well due to caustic soda prices increasing on the back of the phase out of mercurybased chlorine production. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by €4.0 million, or 1.2%, from €346.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €350.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to negative topline scale effect and lower asset availability and production output in our Swiss manufacturing site within the Custom Manufacturing business unit. _Gross Profit_ Gross profit decreased by €9.7 million, or 9.5%, from €101.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €92.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to negative topline scale effect and lower asset availability and production output in our Swiss manufacturing site within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, partially offset by positive product mix effects, realized costs savings and an increased positive contribution from the Acetyls business unit. _Research and Development Expenses_ Research and development expenses remained unchanged, at €2.6 million for the financial years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017. _Distribution and Logistics Expenses_ Distribution and logistics expenses remained largely unchanged, decreasingly slightly by €0.2 million, or 0.3%, from €59.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €59.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. _General and Administrative Expenses_ General and administrative expenses increased by €1.8 million, or 8.5%, from €21.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €23.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher non-recurring expenses incurred in conjunction with strategic market studies and business development projects as well as to costs incurred in conjunction with changes in personnel composition of management functions. _Other Income_ Other income increased by €0.5 million from €0.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €0.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017, due to the recognition of the sale of all shares of CABB (India) Ltd. in 2017, by which sale we divested our former manufacturing site in India. _Other Expenses_ Other expenses decreased by €1.4 million from €5.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €4.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in other expenses was 83 ----- primarily due to a decrease in the amount of impairment losses recognized in connection with the business operations at our former manufacturing site in India, partially offset by the recognition in the financial year ended December 31, 2017 of impairment losses relating to a cash generating unit within our Chinese subsidiary. _Financial Result_ Financial result amounted to a net expense of €55.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of €19.4 million, or 53.7%, from a net expense of €36.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016, mainly due to foreign currency translation losses on euro-denominated intragroup loans with CABB AG. Primarily as a result of these losses, net foreign currency result decreased from a gain of €0.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of €14.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. Interest income and similar and interest expense and similar remained unchanged. Other financial income decreased by €2.6 million from €3.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €0.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the subsequent measurement of the fair value of financial instruments embedded in the Existing Notes, which led to an income of €3.1 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2016. In the financial year ended December 31, 2017, other financial income included a decrease in the negative fair value of an interest rate swap. Other financial expenses increased by €1.8 million from €1.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €2.9 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in other financial expenses was primarily due to the subsequent measurement of the financial instruments embedded in the Existing Notes. In the financial year ended December 31, 2016, other financial expenses increased due to the recognition of the negative fair value of an interest rate swap. _Taxes on Income_ Taxes on income increased by €2.8 million from tax income of €3.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to tax income of €6.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher tax income from the derecognition of deferred tax liabilities. _Net Profit (Loss) for the Period_ Due to the factors discussed above, net loss for the period increased by €26.0 million, from a net loss of €19.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to a net loss of €45.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. Net loss attributable to our shareholders increased by €25.5 million from a loss of €18.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of €44.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 and the non-controlling interest increased by €0.5 million from a loss of €1.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to a loss of €1.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The increase was driven by a strong performance in both business units. Group Adjusted EBITDA allocated to our Custom Manufacturing business unit increased by €3.6 million, or 12.5%, from €28.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €32.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The increase was mainly driven by a sales volume driven topline increase of new products and growth from the existing portfolio. Intermediates outperformed the prior year’s period due to positive pricing trends and positive product mix effects in combination with stable production. The product group benefitted from continuous high caustic soda prices. Our specialties slightly outperformed the prior year’s period, while our pharmaceutical products remained stable year-on-year. Group Adjusted EBITDA allocated to our Acetyls business unit increased by €2.7 million, or 16.6%, from €16.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to €19.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The increase was mainly driven by the MCA product group, which benefited from decreasing raw material prices (acetic acid and anhydride) in combination with continuing positive pricing effects resulting from the pass on of higher raw material prices incurred in prior quarters, charged on to a 84 ----- large extent with a time lag via formula sales prices. The Adjusted EBITDA contribution of derivatives slightly increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to positive pricing effects. Adjusted EBITDA of our co-products decreased year-on-year, driven by lower volumes and higher electricity prices, partially offset by continued high caustic soda prices. Group Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €0.9 million, or 1.1%, from €81.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €80.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 on a like-for-like basis, primarily due to decreased revenue in Custom Manufacturing as a result of the temporary outage of a transformer at our production site in Switzerland, partially offset by increased revenue in Acetyls. Group Adjusted EBITDA allocated to our Custom Manufacturing business unit decreased by €2.1 million, from €56.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €54.0 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 on a like-for-like basis. The decrease was driven by unfavorable product mix effects in our agrochemical products, in combination with temporary production difficulties, leading to higher cost of goods sold. Sales volumes of our pharmaceutical products and specialties remained below prior year’s performance, while the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of intermediates increased moderately due to positive pricing effects. Group Adjusted EBITDA allocated to our Acetyls business unit increased by €1.7 million from €28.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 to €30.5 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 on a like-for-like basis. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in our derivatives and co-products, with co-products particularly strong on the back of increased caustic soda prices, partially offset by a decline in the MCA product group, due to increased raw material prices (acetic acid and anhydride). Group Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €7.1 million, or 8.0%, from €88.4 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €81.3 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the sales development of our Custom Manufacturing business. Group Adjusted EBITDA allocated to our Custom Manufacturing business unit decreased by €11.1 million, from €67.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €56.1 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a moderate decline in the revenue contribution of agrochemical products primarily driven by negative product mix effects in combination with temporary production difficulties, leading to higher cost of goods sold, as well as decreased revenue contributions for pharmaceutical products and specialties as compared to the prior year. The revenue contribution of intermediates remained largely unchanged. Group Adjusted EBITDA allocated to our Acetyls business unit increased by €3.2 million, from €25.6 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2016 to €28.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the release of a provision in the amount of €2.3 million provided for potential reimbursements of electricity network charges and an increase in the revenue contribution of our co-products, driven by positive volume and pricing impacts, including the phase out of mercury cell technology in Europe, which led to reduced production capacity and thus increased prices on selective products, such as caustic soda. The Adjusted EBITDA contributions of MCA and derivatives remained slightly below prior year due to the impact on market prices from the recent new entrant to the European market, PCC Rokita, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Group Adjusted EBITDA for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2019 apply IFRS 9 Financial _Instruments, IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16 Leases as of January 1, 2018,_ using modified retrospective methods.

The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd. The calculations of the assets and liabilities recognized with regard to these facilities are based on statistical and actuarial calculations. In particular, the present value of the defined benefit obligation depends on assumptions such as the discount rate and the pension growth rate used for calculating the present value of the future pension obligations. Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by us also use statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions.

IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets. Transition effects are recognized cumulatively in equity as of the date of initial application without restating prior-period information, which is presented in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: _Recognition and Measurement. Transition effects from the first-time adoption of IFRS 9, which were not_ material, primarily resulted from the recognition of additional impairments in accordance with the expected loss model. See Note 2 to the 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 91 ----- _IFRS 15_ We adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS 15”) on January 1, 2018, by following the modified retrospective method. Transition effects are recognized cumulatively in equity as of the date of initial application without restating prior-period information, which is presented in accordance with previous rules. In accordance with IFRS 15.C7, only contracts that had not yet been completed as of the date of initial application were transitioned to the new standard. Contract modifications arising prior to the date of first-time application (IFRS 15.C7 A(b)) did not have to be accounted for. As part of the adoption of the new standard, the items “contract assets” and “contract liability” were added to the balance sheet. Advance payments received in connection with product deliveries were previously included within trade accounts payable. With the introduction of IFRS 15, these advance payments received are presented as contract liabilities. Within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, revenue for certain products within the exclusives product group are now recognized over time rather than at a certain point in time. Revenue for these products are now recognized when payments become unconstrained, leading to an earlier revenue recognition as compared to revenue recognition under IAS 18. As of January 1, 2018, this change led to the recognition of contract assets in an amount of €5.5 million and to a reduction of inventories in an amount of €3.6 million. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of €1.5 million increasing retained earnings were recognized as of January 1, 2018. For certain contracts within the exclusives product group, the performance obligation consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities (“stand ready obligation”) within the contract period, leading to a deferred revenue recognition as compared to revenue recognition under IAS 18. As of January 1, 2018, this change led to the recognition of contract liabilities in an amount of €3.8 million. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of €3.1 million reducing retained earnings were recognized. Within the Acetyls business unit, the transition to IFRS 15 had no impact on the timing of revenue recognition, as customer contracts refer to standardized products, which generally only give rise to a performance obligation, which is to be fulfilled at a certain point in time. In total, as of January 1, 2018, due to the changed timing of revenue recognition, we recognized contract assets of €5.5 million, a decrease in inventories of €3.6 million and a recognition of contract liabilities of €3.8 million. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of €1.6 million decreasing retained earnings were recognized as of January 1, 2018. The introduction of IFRS 15 led to a €0.1 million increase in net sales and a €0.9 million decrease in cost of sales in the financial year 2018, resulting in a €0.2 million increase in deferred tax expense in 2018 as compared to revenue recognition under IAS 18. See Note 2 to the 2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. _IFRS 16_ We adopted IFRS 16 Leases (“IFRS 16”) on January 1, 2018, by following the modified retrospective method, without a restatement of comparative information, which is presented in line with the previous rules under IAS 17. IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right-of-use asset for lease contracts, subject to limited exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. At transition, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at January 1, 2018. Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. The Group applied this approach to all leases. The application of IFRS 16 did not lead to any impacts on retained earnings. In conjunction with the transition to the new accounting standard, right-of-use assets of €10.2 million and lease liabilities of €10.2 million were recognized as of January 1, 2018.

According to the industry research firm Phillips McDougall, the global agrochemicals industry accounted for approximately $57.6 billion in sales of crop protection products in 2018, as compared to $54.3 billion in 2017, indicating that the market has returned to growth after a compound annual decline of 2.6% from 2014 to 2017. The global crop protection market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 5.3% from 2008 to 2014 to a historic peak level of $58.7 billion in 2014. From 2014, the agrochemicals market declined considerably due to decreased crop commodity prices and subsequently lower net cash income, lower pest pressure and recession in South America, before returning to growth in 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Agrochemicals products fall into three principal categories: (i) herbicides for the control of weeds, (ii) insecticides for the control of insects and (iii) fungicides for the control of fungi and molds with products focused on the protection of fruits and vegetables, cereals, soybean, corn, rice, cotton and rape. We estimate that such products represent more than 88% of the global agrochemicals industry in terms of sales with herbicides representing the largest share of agrochemicals used globally. Seed treatment with insecticides and fungicides for the protection of seeds at planting, often considered as part of the agrochemicals market, is not a market that we focus on. In 2018, herbicides comprised approximately 43% of the global agrochemicals industry by sales and were used against various kinds of crop weeds, such as blackgrass, wild oats, cleavers and common chickweed. Insecticides accounted for approximately 25% of the global agrochemicals industry by sales, which were used to protect crops against pests, such as aphids, whitefly and leafrollers. Fungicides, which are used against various types of crop fungi, such as powdery mildew, blight, apple scab, botrytis and eyespot, accounted for approximately 28% of sales. Crop protection products other than herbicides, insecticides and fungicides accounted for approximately 4% of the global agrochemicals industry by sales in 2018. In 2017, according to Phillips McDougall, North America and Central & South America accounted for 20% and 23%, while Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East & Africa accounted for approximately 30%, 21% and 4% of sales of the agrochemicals industry, respectively. Demand for agrochemicals products is largely dependent on weather. Wet weather tends to encourage growth of molds and fungi and therefore increases demand for fungicides, but it does not provide ideal conditions for insects and as a result potentially lowers demand for insecticides. Strong winds, especially hurricanes, help spread diseases, notably mold and fungi spores, while good weather generally encourages more weed pressure. Symptoms of climate change, such as rising temperatures or extreme weather events such as strong droughts or excessive rain, can impact harvests and therefore impact both farm incomes and crop plant decisions. The use of agrochemicals products is also partly influenced by potential farmer 93 ----- income. The higher the crop prices (or the value of the crop in the ground), the more likely a farmer is to pay for greater amounts of higher-quality agrochemicals products to protect the crop. In 2009, crop prices declined from their peak as the global economy experienced a downturn, which, coupled with a major reduction in prices for glyphosate (a non-selective, lower value herbicide not part of our product portfolio) due to increased supply from Chinese companies, resulted in a decline in the overall value of the global agrochemicals industry. Since 2009, the global agrochemicals industry experienced growth due to generally high crop demand, growth in developing markets and strong biofuel demand against a backdrop of high oil prices. The global agrochemicals market declined in 2015 due to weaker demand for products resulting from generally high inventory levels of farmers, reduced crop prices and weaker glyphosate prices, while weather anomalies such as the El Niño and Monsoon effects had further adverse impacts on farmer income and the global agrochemicals industry. In 2018, the agrochemicals market rebounded, as yields remained generally strong, glyphosate prices improved and traders started to destock. Demand for agrochemicals products is expected to continue to benefit from continued long-term trends, driven primarily by global population growth, less arable land availability, increased meat consumption (in particular in emerging markets), the increased use of corn and sugar cane for biofuels and generally higher yield requirements for farmers. Increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in a number of markets, notably the EU, and growing resistance of pesticides against established crop protection products have led to the phase-out and replacement of older agrochemicals products and incentivized agrochemical companies to invest in the development of new active ingredients. In the first half of 2019, the agrochemicals industry saw various challenges, including customer destocking and historic flooding in the United States, resulting in significantly late planting and an overall reduction in acreages, as well as severe droughts in Australia and Indonesia, while farmers continue to face challenges with trade disputes between the United States and China. Demand volume in Latin America improved compared to 2018, partly due to the return of inventories for crop protection products in Brazil to normal levels.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.3,Competitive landscape of global agrochemicals players,5.3.1,Overview of agrochemicals custom manufacturing,"Our customers in the agrochemicals industry manage their crop protection supply chain globally and on a product-by-product basis, from raw materials through delivery to the customer, in order to maximize cost and capital efficiency and responsiveness to customer demands. Agrochemical companies partially outsource the manufacture of a wide range of raw materials, from commodities through fine chemicals to dedicated intermediates and active ingredients. Growth of active ingredients and advanced intermediate custom manufacturing is primarily driven by the major global agrochemicals players’ use of agrochemicals custom manufacturers as a source of additional production capacity in order to serve the global demand for agrochemicals products. While, historically, agrochemicals companies invested in in-house capacity by setting up dedicated large-volume plants, they have, for the last few years, increasingly committed to an outsourcing strategy allocating a larger share of production to external custom manufacturers, which provide flexible multi-purpose and multi-product capacity. This trend is supported by the development of new molecules, which are becoming increasingly complex and more active and are often based on multi-step synthesis, which requires demanding technical capabilities. Custom manufacturers typically run scalable operations, offer the required expertise in order to achieve high productivity and are well advanced on the production learning curve. As a result, they are able to produce active ingredients and advanced intermediates more cost-effectively and offer higher operational flexibility than in-house production of agrochemicals. Due to the clear production and chemical process development focus, agrochemicals custom manufacturers also distinguish themselves by their technical and process capabilities, which, in combination with high reliability of delivery time and product quality, enable custom manufacturers to provide an enhanced service level to agrochemicals suppliers. Outsourcing reduces the asset intensity of agrochemicals companies, limits the risks associated with otherwise large upfront investments and allows them to deploy capital with a stronger focus on their core capabilities and key elements of the value chain, for instance research and development as well as marketing and distribution. Custom manufacturers typically work in close cooperation with and often on an exclusive basis for select products with agrochemicals suppliers in order to set up scalable manufacturing units and efficient production processes. This production process know how, combined with required product registration undertaken by agrochemicals companies, results in low levels of customer churn and relatively high contract renewal rates in custom manufacturing. According to Phillips McDougall, the global agrochemicals industry was worth approximately $57.6 billion in sales of crop protection products in 2018. According to industry sources, the manufacturing of active ingredients and advanced intermediates (including all synthesis steps but excluding the manufacturing of base intermediates) that is in principal addressable to agrochemicals custom manufacturers had a value of approximately $10.0 billion to $11.0 billion in 2018. According to industry sources and our estimates, approximately 40% of this market is currently outsourced by agrochemicals players to agrochemicals custom manufacturers. We believe that the current trend toward outsourcing to custom manufacturers within the agrochemicals industry will continue given the growth of the agrochemicals industry, the limited in-house capacity of agrochemicals players that are running at high capacity utilization levels and the limited incremental in-house capacity coming on stream in a market that has strongly consolidated over the last years, and in which competitors seek to focus on research, development and marketing.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.3,Competitive landscape of global agrochemicals players,5.3.2,Competitive landscape in agrochemicals custom manufacturing,"We believe that the top three European agrochemicals custom manufacturers, which are considered strategic suppliers to the agrochemicals industry, are CABB, Saltigo and Lonza Agro Ingredients. Other players in custom manufacturing include ESIM Chemicals and Weylchem in Europe, Lianhetech in China, as well as Albemarle in North America. We believe that we would hold a global number two position in custom manufacturing for the agrochemicals industry by estimated revenue after the integration of Jayhawk. These strategic players, including us, are typically highly integrated into the supply chain of the global agrochemicals players (often accompanied by co investments of agrochemicals suppliers into capacity build ups), offer broad and flexible technological capabilities, ensure high quality process and product standards and comply with strict regulatory and IP protection requirements of agrochemicals suppliers. Historically, the agrochemicals custom manufacturing industry has been more fragmented, with additional players being active in the space. Consolidation has increased over the past few years, resulting in the top 95 ----- five companies accounting for a larger share of the total agrochemicals custom manufacturing industry, primarily driven by mergers and acquisitions activity (e.g., the acquisitions of KemFine and Jayhawk by CABB or its controlling shareholder and Allessa by Weylchem) and the increased importance of strategic partnerships between suppliers and customers. Strategic suppliers are usually invited to bid for new projects or additional volumes of existing products. We believe that strategic suppliers will continue to benefit from the growth of the agrochemicals industry and grow faster than the overall agrochemicals custom manufacturing industry due to their relationships with key customers and their scalable operations. For example, Saltigo completed a major investment program of €60 million into the renovation and expansion of its synthesis capacity in Germany in late 2017 with the aim of accommodating further customer projects. In China, we expect further contraction of capacity, as China’s thirteenth Five Year Plan and its focus on environmental issues calls for major closures and relocations of chemical industrial parks. We expect this to benefit us, as they tend toward reduced competition in custom manufacturing, while at the same time our customers continue to expand into China, which we would expect would increase demand for our products.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The purity grade of MCA is determined by the content of dichloroacetic acid (DCA). The highest purity grade is Ultra Pure grade, which is mainly used in personal care/cosmetics and in pharmaceutical products. High Pure grade MCA is used in food, personal care/cosmetics and in PVC additives. The Technical Global grade is mainly used in agrochemicals and in the synthesis of CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) for applications such as detergent formulations, oil drilling muds and paper coating. The lowest purity grade is Technical Local, which has lower specifications and therefore is mainly sold to regions demanding lower value, for example in China. Asian producers mainly base their production on the traditional sulphur process, batch chlorination (versus continuous operations) and batch crystallization (versus hydrogenation), resulting in significant waste volumes and lower purity levels of MCA. 96 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.5,Illustrative MCA value chain,5.5.2,,"The predominant method of production of MCA is chlorination of acetic acid with chlorine gas. Acetic acid anhydride serves as a co-catalyst in the chlorination process. Purification can be achieved by two different processes, recrystallization and hydrogenation, which result in different purity grades. According to industry research, Nouryon, formerly Akzo Nobel Specialty Chemicals, and we are the only companies using hydrogenation technology, which enables the production of High Purity MCA. Chlorine gas and caustic soda are produced by electrolysis of sodium chloride salt. A by-product of the reaction of acetic acid and chlorine gas reaction is hydrochloric acid. Caustic soda can be combined with acetic acid to produce sodium acetate. We are, to our knowledge, currently the only MCA manufacturer globally providing the full range of MCA trade forms as well as essential derivatives, i.e., liquid, molten, flakes, esters and salt. Flakes consist of dry MCA and allow shipment over long distances, after which they are dissolved into solution locally; however, this trade form requires special handling expertise and is relatively labor-intensive. Second, MCA can be supplied as an aqueous or alcoholic solution (typically with titers of between 70% and 90%), which can be transported by road, rail and sea and avoids manual handling of this hazardous material. Third, a convenient and cost efficient trade form is molten.

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.6,Overview of MCA purity grades and applications,5.6.1,Global supply and demand balance and trade flows,"Global MCA trade flows are often characterized by regional supply and demand due to the corrosive nature of MCA and relatively high transportation costs. European MCA supply and demand is relatively balanced, with some excess volumes being exported to North and South America and select customers requiring Ultra Pure or High Pure grade MCA (e.g., in South-East Asia or Australia). Asian suppliers (e.g., China) export only smaller volumes of lower-quality MCA to NAFTA customers. According to IHS Markit, aggregate demand and supply operating rates for MCA are expected to moderately increase from 80% in 2017 to 83% in 2022 for Western and Central Europe, while in China operating rates are expected to increase more significantly from 76% in 2017 to 87% in 2022. According to IHS Markit, global production capacity for MCA is concentrated in Asia, with China accounting for approximately 66% of global MCA capacity in 2017. However, production in China primarily relates to Technical Global and Technical Local grade MCA and primarily targets domestic consumers due to significantly lower quality requirements vis-à-vis other regions and relatively high transportation costs. Nouryon is the only other supplier in China producing Ultra Pure, High Pure and Technical Global grade MCA based on hydrogenation technology and serving Chinese consumers as well as exports. As China represents the largest region in terms of MCA use globally with attractive historic growth rates we entered the Chinese market by establishing a joint venture in 2013 with Jining Jinwei Gold Power in Jining, Shandong Province, North China, with a view to constructing a new MCA facility based on our proprietary hydrogenation technology to serve domestic and multi-national customers with High Purity grade MCA. In 2016, we began series production of MCA in China. Despite the sizeable installed production capacity in China, supply and demand is characterized by regional disparities with the majority of capacity located in Eastern China and limited capacity in North China. Although the Chinese market today is dominated by Technical Global and Technical Local grade MCA, we believe that the domestic demand will shift toward Ultra-Pure and High Pure grade MCA as a result of increasing customer awareness and movement toward a relatively stricter regulatory environment. 97 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

To our knowledge, we and Nouryon are the only two suppliers which have the technological know-how in purification technology (hydrogenation) and the production facilities necessary to produce Ultra Pure and High Pure grade MCA in significant volumes. Our MCA production facilities in Gersthofen and Knapsack produce Ultra Pure, High Pure and Technical Global grade MCA, and our production facility in Jining, Shandong Province, China is increasingly focused on High Purity MCA. MCA is used in a broad array of end uses resulting in overall low volatility of demand. The key applications for MCA are CMC food additives, personal care, paper, agrochemicals for herbicides, betaines for surfactants, TGA (thioglycolic acid) for hair care and plastic additives, and other specialty chemical applications such as personal care and pharmaceuticals. There are different regional profiles that influence global MCA use. In Europe, which accounted for approximately 13% of global MCA consumption in 2017, the focus is on Ultra Pure and High Pure grade MCA with personal care, food and to a lesser extent agrochemicals being the most relevant end use applications.

MCA esters are reactive intermediates used in organic synthesis primarily for Vitamin A, fungicides and in contrast media (X-ray diagnoses). Glycolic acid is produced by the reaction of MCA with caustic soda and subsequent re-acidification. It is used, for example, in personal care, detergents and medical sutures, but also in the oil and gas industries. TCA is produced by chlorination of MCA and is used in oligonucleotide-synthesis (anti-cancer pharmaceuticals) and agrochemical (herbicides) applications. Acetyl derivatives are typically highly specialized products manufactured for only a select number of customers for whom these derivatives represent critical input factors in their production processes.

We make use of these co-products by using them in subsequent production steps or by selling them to customers. Caustic soda is the main co-product and is produced in the chlor-alkali electrolysis together with chlorine. Caustic soda is a base chemical used in a variety of chemical processes and applications and is mainly sold to external customers and, to a smaller extent, used to produce the downstream product sodium acetate, which is mainly used in the food industry. Another co-product is hydrochloric acid, which emerges during the MCA production process and is typically sold as a base chemical in a wide range of applications. The supply and demand for caustic soda and hydrochloric acid is relatively regional in nature due to high logistics and transportation cost, and these co-products are typically sold within a radius of 200 km to 300 km around a production facility. While both caustic soda and hydrochloric acid are commodity products 98 ----- with large supply and demand volumes, we are a comparatively small player. Generally, caustic soda supply is largely driven by chlorine demand rather than end-market demand, which itself is highly dependent on activity levels of the broader PVC industry. As a result, the price development of caustic soda is often counter-cyclical. For instance, an economic slowdown would typically affect the PVC industry, leading to lower chlorine production and hence, lower caustic soda volumes, which subsequently would lead to a price surge of caustic soda. Comparing historical prices, we believe prices around €550/dmt are close to break-even levels for caustic soda importers asking for overseas shipping of caustic soda, which is a lengthy process and entails significant costs for freight, distribution and working capital management costs for importers. However, we believe such importers are aware of the pricing risks they face during the shipment of products. Sodium acetate is used as a buffering agent in a wide range of industries such as food (as an additive as well as for barbecue sauce), pharmaceutical (products for treatment of diabetes, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and infusions) and agrochemicals (pH-stabilizer). In addition, sodium acetate is also used in applications such as rubber, manufacturing, construction, paper and other industrial applications. Sodium acetate is sold directly to end users across industries without a defined regional focus.

Our Custom Manufacturing business unit focuses on the production of exclusives and intermediates. Exclusives are active ingredients and advanced intermediates customized for individual customers operating in the agrochemicals, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries. Our exclusives (74% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018) are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides in the agrochemicals industry and range from pilot scale to large-volume commercial operations. Our intermediates (26% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018) are products manufactured for multiple customers and include acid chlorides, chemical building blocks and various base chemicals. They are to a large extent used in agrochemical and pharmaceutical applications, but also in other diverse end-uses such as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and dyestuffs for textile application. Our Acetyls business unit focuses on the production of monochloroacetic acid, or MCA, acetyl derivatives and co-products, which have a variety of applications in the agrochemicals, food, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. MCA, the business unit’s main product, accounted for 61% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. Derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid and trichloroacetic acid, accounted for 19% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and accounted for 20% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. The end uses for our agrochemicals are spread across a number of crops, with 46% of agrochemicals revenue attributable to corn, 9% to cereal, 6% to soy, 5% to food and vegetables and 34% to other products for the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Agrochemicals revenue are also spread across different applications, with 68% attributable to herbicide applications, 29% to fungicides and 3% to insecticides for the same period.

We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from positive long-term growth trends in the agrochemicals market and are investing in capacity and yield improvement to support the growth of our business. Headquartered in Germany, we operate production facilities in Germany, Switzerland, Finland and China. In Custom Manufacturing, we operate two large production facilities, in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland). In Acetyls, we operate three technologically-advanced production facilities: in Gersthofen and Knapsack (Germany) and in Jining, Shandong Province (China) through our majority-owned joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd. We benefit from the cost advantage of operating large-scale, highly integrated production facilities strategically located near key customers and suppliers as well as transportation networks. For the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2019, we generated total revenue of €470.6 million and Group Adjusted EBITDA of €93.8 million, while Jayhawk Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $12.6 million and Combined Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €104.8 million. For the same period, our Custom Manufacturing and Acetyls business units accounted for 60.6% and 39.4% of our total revenue, respectively.

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.10,Industry Overview,5.10.1,,"The global agrochemicals industry has been one of the main drivers of agricultural productivity increases over the past decades. Industry research firm Phillips McDougall estimates that the global crop protection 100 ----- industry accounted for approximately $57.6 billion in sales in 2018, having grown at a CAGR of 2.9% per annum from 2016 to 2018. The growth of custom manufacturing is driven by the major global agrochemicals players’ use of outsourcing as a source of additional production capacity in order to serve the steadily increasing global demand for agrochemicals. In recent years, agrochemicals companies have allocated a larger share of production to external custom manufacturers, which provide flexible multi-purpose and multi-product capacity. Outsourcing reduces agrochemical companies’ asset intensity, limits the risks associated with large, upfront investments and allows them to deploy capital with a stronger focus on their core capabilities, such as research and development as well as marketing and distribution. This trend is supported by new molecules becoming increasingly complex and more active, often based on multi-step synthesis, which requires demanding technical capabilities. Custom manufacturers typically work in close co-operation and often on an exclusive or near-exclusive basis for select products with agrochemical companies in order to set up scalable manufacturing units and efficient production processes. This production know-how, combined with often lengthy product registration, generally results in low customer churn and high contract renewal rates in custom manufacturing. For Acetyls, according to Tecnon OrbiChem, the global MCA market in 2018 was approximately 1.867kt. Global MCA trade flows are often characterized by regional supply and demand due to the corrosive nature of MCA and relatively high transportation costs, which encourage proximity to customers. CABB and Nouryon (formerly Akzo Nobel) are currently the only large-scale producers of high-purity grade MCA, which is mostly used in developed markets and has high-end applications.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.11,Our Strengths,5.11.1,Leading market positions globally supported by high barriers to entry,"We have leading market positions in the Western European and, after giving effect to the Contribution, the U.S. markets in which we operate. Following the Contribution, we believe we would be the second largest European custom manufacturing supplier in the global agrochemicals market by sales. We serve four of the top five global agrochemicals companies, which accounted for approximately 61% of the global agrochemicals market by revenue in 2018, according to Phillips McDougall. We believe that three of these global agrochemical companies regard us as a strategic supplier for their agrochemicals business. We also have a foothold in non-agrochemical end-markets, such as life-sciences and flavors and fragrances. Our customized products are highly integrated in our key customers’ supply chains (often protected by “key supplier” relationships for major products) and we are closely aligned in demand planning and coordination. We have flexible, multi-purpose custom manufacturing plants that allow for optimized downtimes between different product campaigns and change-overs. We believe we are the largest MCA supplier in Europe and the second largest MCA supplier globally based on production capacity. We attribute our strong market positions to the high quality of our products, our long-standing customer relationships, our proprietary MCA purification technology, our cost advantageous hydrogenation production technology and backward integrated electrolysis technology. We are one of the few MCA manufacturers capable of producing the highest purity grades in different application forms. Our strong market positions in both custom manufacturing and acetyls are supported by high barriers to entry, preventing new competitors from easily entering these markets. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we possess strong technical experience and process design capabilities, which are important for securing new contracts. We believe that a new market-entrant seeking to replicate our facilities in Pratteln and Kokkola would face large capital investment costs. We are also protected by high switching costs for our customers due to our high integration into our customers’ supply chains and their participation in capital expenditures related to the developments of new products. In the Acetyls business unit, we believe that our production plants would require large capital investments to replicate. The acetyls market is regional in nature due to specific product characteristics such as corrosiveness, which encourage proximity to customers and involve complex logistical planning. In addition, both the custom manufacturing and acetyls industries are subject to European Union regulations, including the REACH regulation and lengthy registration and approval processes, which limit the risk of new entrants. 101 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.11,Our Strengths,5.11.2,Resilient megatrends driving attractive growth in agrochemicals,"The agrochemicals industry is our key end-market with 65% of Custom Manufacturing business unit sales in 2018 attributable to this sector. Although the global agrochemicals market declined after 2014 due to decreased crop commodity prices and subsequently lower net cash farm income, lower pest pressure and recession in South America, the market has recently shown signs of recovery, with agrochemicals players reporting year-on-year growth in early 2019 until severe North American weather conditions led to a temporary downturn due to limited crop planting in this region. Key drivers of historical growth in the agrochemicals industry include global trends in population growth, increasing meat consumption and rising demand for crops and food, while the food, personal care and cosmetics end-markets have historically been relatively resilient to changes in general economic conditions. Overall, the crop protection industry grew at a CAGR of 5.3% per annum from 2008 to 2014, declined at a rate of 2.6% from 2014 to 2017 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.5% from 2017 to 2023, according to the industry research firm Phillips McDougall. Another trend we benefit from is the outsourcing of manufacturing processes in the crop protection market. Due to increasing product complexity, potential to achieve additional cost savings or to improve returns and sector consolidation, certain agrochemical players choose to focus on key elements of their value chain (research and development and marketing) over manufacturing. We believe that this trend has resulted in a steadily increasing share of outsourced manufacturing. According to third-party information, the outsourcing share of the crop protection sector represented a market of $4-5 billion in 2017. Moreover, as major agrochemical players focus more on research and development (for example, molecule discovery), they require partners with know-how on how to bring lab processes to plant scale. In line with this trend, we launched a new service called “ChemCreations” which offers our customers production process development services such as process research and development. This additional service allows us to participate in the early stages of our clients’ product development, which increases the likelihood that their production processes will be outsourced to us at later stages.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.11,Our Strengths,5.11.3,Long-standing blue-chip customer base with high visibility of revenues,"We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers. Based on revenue in 2018, approximately 80% of our top ten customer relationships exceed ten years and approximately 50% extend to more than 30 years. We are a trusted partner to many leading agrochemicals and specialties companies who rely on our solutions and significant expertise for their products and applications. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, typical customer contracts range in length from three to five years, which provides us with good revenue visibility. For example, more than 50% of our revenue from our top 14 agrochemicals exclusives in 2018 was generated under contracts with a term of three or more years. Together with the revenue visibility such longer-term contracts provide, our customers’ long-term commitments are supported by a track record of co-investments in production facilities through upfront capital expenditure or top-up pricing over the term of the contract. Our customer base in custom manufacturing reflects the concentration of the crop protection market, with the top six customers by revenue accounting for approximately 78% of the business unit’s revenue in 2018. We are a “key supplier”, supplying over 90% of the customers’ supply, of select active ingredients and advanced intermediates for certain customers. For example, approximately 70% of our revenue from our top 14 agrochemical exclusives revenue was generated under key supplier agreements in the financial year ended December 31, 2018. Our customer base includes four of the top five global agrochemicals companies, with whom we work in close cooperation in terms of process development and planning. In addition, while agrochemicals are a key end market for our Custom Manufacturing products (representing 65% of revenue of the business unit in 2018), we are diversifying into other applications, such as high-value intermediates, pharmaceuticals and specialties (representing 26%, 8% and 1% of revenue of the business unit in 2018, respectively). In the Acetyls business unit, our MCA revenue is well-diversified among end-markets including home and personal care, agrochemicals, food and pharmaceuticals, among others. We currently expect these endmarkets to exhibit growth rates from the low-to-mid-single-digits (pharmaceuticals) to the mid-single-digits (personal care and pharmaceuticals) in the coming years. Diversified applications allow our acetyls business to be exposed to favorable growth prospects in a wide range of industries, such as crop protection, packaged food and personal care.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.11,Our Strengths,5.11.4,High visibility on lifecycle and returns with attractive product pipeline and strategic partnerships in custom manufacturing,"Our Custom Manufacturing business unit has developed strategic partnerships with well-known companies, including some of the largest global agrochemicals producers. Due to our high level of 102 ----- integration with our customers’ product development and long contract terms, we have high visibility on the lifecycle and returns on our products. Our long-term contracts often provide for guaranteed volumes in the initial period, contributing to a high contract renewal rate and low customer churn. Moreover, our customers often pay part of the capital expenditures related to new product developments, while minimum contract terms provide payback of the capital expenditures incurred directly by us. We have a strong track record of securing strategic launch projects with the top four agrochemical majors. We estimate based on publicly available information that such customers contacted us regarding more than half of their public product launches during the years from 2015 to 2018, and that we were successful in securing 43% of those product launches. A typical payback period on our projects is three to four years, and we have an attractive pipeline of growth projects. Between 2017 and the end of the year 2019, we expect to have spent approximately €22 million on capital expenditures for growth projects, and we expect to spend more than €55 million on further growth projects with our customers in the future. In addition, we believe that the Contribution has tangible synergy potential and will contribute to our future growth. Additionally, we believe that Jayhawk has state-of-the-art facilities with standalone high single digit growth potential based on its existing portfolio and the ramping up of new products. Jayhawk’s attractive end-market exposure is complementary to ours and includes industries such as specialties, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (representing approximately 65%, 19% and 16% of Jayhawk revenues in 2018, respectively).

In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we operate complementary multi-purpose production facilities in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland) with combined batch reactor capacity of approximately 800 cubic meters (large batch volume production capabilities in Kokkola and full scale-up capabilities in Pratteln). We produce on-site a substantial amount of the raw materials required for production at our Pratteln facility, and the facility’s backward integration enables many by-products to be recycled for internal use, thereby reducing waste and helping us to maintain a competitive cost structure. In addition, through systematic optimization of process parameters, improvement of maintenance service and change-over scheduling as well as Lean Six Sigma tools training, we are aiming to increase our production further in the coming years. Our Acetyls business unit’s production facilities in Germany and our Chinese site use our proprietary hydrogenation technology for the production of MCA, which provides significant production cost and product quality advantages over the alternative crystallization technology. Our Gersthofen facility uses backward-integrated electrolysis technology for captive chlorine production, while our Knapsack facility and our Chinese facility source chlorine on-site via a pipeline from adjacent third-party PVC chlorine plants which repurchase the hydrochloric acid generated during the production of MCA. We believe that the high level of capital investment required to develop integrated and efficient production facilities, combined with the technological expertise required for the production processes, are key factors to our operating success and the limited number of new competitors entering our markets. Moreover, we consider our logistics capabilities as a key differentiator from our competitors. We currently have a large in-house managed leased fleet to transport high corrosion materials required in our production processes, and we are also modernizing our fleet with leased titanium railcars to transport MCA. These titanium railcars are 40% lighter than regular railcars and can capture 30% more product volumes. In addition, we are in the process of rolling out GPS tracking for all railcars across our fleet to allow for constant information flow to customers and rapid action in case of delays.

Products manufactured for customers in the pharmaceutical market segment include commodities, portfolio products and bespoke multi-stage chemical building blocks. Products manufactured for customers in specialties segments include a variety of end-market applications, including personal care, cosmetics, feed and textiles. 106 ----- _Intermediates_ Intermediates are chemical products which are not produced for one specific customer but are sold to a range of customers. Our intermediates are comprised of base chemicals, which are co-products of chemical core processes on the Pratteln site, reagents for chlorination and sulphonation and portfolio products such as ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate (CAE) and a variety of acid chlorides. Intermediates are used in agrochemical as well as in pharmaceutical and specialty applications such as X-ray contrast media, automotive, detergents and vitamins for animal feed. We currently manufacture twelve acid chloride and chloride products, eight building block and nine base chemicals at our production facility in Pratteln, Switzerland. Key acid chlorides include chloroacetyl chloride (CAC), used in agrochemical applications as well as in pharmaceutical applications (e.g., pain relievers, X-ray contrast media) and octanoylchloride (OCC), used for the synthesis of silica reinforced energy saving “green tires” as well as in agrochemical applications. Various additional acid chlorides and chlorides products are used in agrochemical synthesis and are also applied in the synthesis of organic peroxides, paper sizing agents, flavor and fragrance, high blood pressure medications, antibiotics and animal feed stock additives. Key building block products based on chlorination and sulphonation processes include sulfuryl chloride (SC), thionyl chloride (TC), CAE, acid chlorides, and chlorosulphonic acid (CSA), all of which are sales products and also precursors to the production of higher integrated intermediates. Ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate (CAE) is the main downstream product of sulfuryl chloride and is used in nutrition products. Thionyl chloride (TC) is used as a chlorination agent in the synthesis of various derivatives such as acid chlorides, chlorides and chloromethyl ethers. CHS is a sulphonation agent produced by reacting sulphur oxides with hydrogen chloride. It is used primarily in the synthesis of selected sulphonated surfactants and resins applied in detergents, dyes and water treatment. Our base chemical products include primarily various by-products generated in large volumes from our chlor-alkali electrolysis and chlorination processes. Chlor-alkali electrolysis yields two main products, chlorine and caustic soda. In various chlorination processes, approximately half of the chlorine is utilized in the process and the other half is transformed into hydrogen chloride and hydrochloric acid as solution.

We offer customers four different purity grades of MCA: (i) ultra-pure grade, (ii) high pure grade, (iii) technical global grade and (iv) technical local grade. The purity of MCA is determined by the content of dichloroacetic acid. Different purity grades are used in different applications and regional markets. For example, technical local grade MCA is more commonly sold in emerging markets, such as China, whereas the leading personal care players mainly require high pure grade or ultra-pure grade for use in their end-products. Technical global grade MCA, which has a higher content of dichloroacetic acid, is primarily used in the production of herbicides and agrochemicals as well as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), which is used as a binding agent and stabilizer. For the financial year ended December 31, 2018, our MCA revenue consisted of 10% from ultra-pure grade, 39% from high pure grade, 43% from technical global grade and 8% from technical local grade MCA. We also produce SMCA, which is used for applications similar to those of MCA. SMCA is produced through a reaction of MCA and sodium carbonate and improves the storage stability of the product. 107 ----- We produce MCA as molten liquid and flakes, the latter of which enables longer distance transportation based on the customer’s preference and location. _Acetyl Derivatives_ We also offer our customers a range of derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid, dichloroacetic acid/dichloroacetylchloride, trichloroacetic acid, and sodium acetate, among others. Methyl and ethyl esters can be manufactured from MCA and either methanol or ethanol. The reactivity of the ester is more selective than that of the free acid and makes it suitable for many synthesis applications, including pharmaceuticals (vitamin A) and crop protection agents (dimethoate). Dichloroacetylchloride and trichloroacetic acid are produced from the chlorination of MCA and continue to be used in agrochemical applications such as herbicides and safeners. Dichloroacetic acid is used as an intermediate in pharmaceutical applications, including in the latest generation of antisense drugs. Sodium acetate is used as a buffering agent in various industry applications in the pharmaceutical and textiles industries as well as a preservative or flavor enhancer in the food industry. Glycolic acid is one of our other primary derivatives. It is produced by the reaction of MCA with sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), followed by re-acidification. Due to its capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid has many applications in skin care and personal care products as well as medical sutures. It is also used in detergents, as a complexing agent in the semiconductor industry and in the food industry as a preservative and flavoring agent. _Co-products_ Various co-products arise or result from our production of chlorine and the chlorination of acetic acid in the MCA production process. We sell such co-products to customers or make use of them in subsequent processes and production steps. The primary co-product from the production of chlorine is caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), a base chemical used in a wide range of chemical applications. We sell the caustic soda produced by our chlorine electrolysis process to the market or, to a lesser extent, use it for our own production. Sales of caustic soda are typically made to customers and other third parties through distributors, with the majority of purchasers located within 300 kilometers of our Gersthofen site due to transportation costs. Other co-products include hydrochloric acid and hydrogen. Hydrochloric acid is typically sold back to suppliers, distributors or end-industry customers.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.18,Sources and Availability of Raw Materials,5.18.1,,"Purchases of raw materials primarily consist of acetic acid, acetic anhydride, chlorine and energy. The chlorine production process based on chlor-alkali electrolysis at our Gersthofen and Pratteln production facilities requires significant amounts of electricity. In 2013, we diversified our supplier base in order to realize cost savings and reduce reliance on a single supplier of acetic acid and acetic anhydride, who had previously supplied us with the majority of those raw materials required for our production process. At our Knapsack plant, we purchase chlorine via pipeline pursuant to a long-term supply contract from Vinnolit, whose chlorine production facility is adjacent to ours. Similarly, our joint venture in China sources its chlorine requirements from our joint venture partner, who operates an adjacent, modern chlorine production facility. In our Acetyls business unit, roughly half of our customer contracts by sales include price formulas that allow for an effective pass-through of price variations in acetic acid and, to a lesser extent, acetic anhydride. These pass-through provisions help to limit significant fluctuations in our cost of sales but typically include a time lag of three months. The remaining revenue in our Acetyls business unit is contracted at spot prices that reflect current prices for raw materials, which mitigates our exposure to fluctuations in raw materials prices. In our Custom Manufacturing business unit, raw materials for production are to a significant extent either provided by our customers or, where we are responsible for the procurement of raw materials, our customer contracts typically include pass-through clauses for raw materials, thereby providing a significant degree of protection from fluctuations in prices of raw materials. For the financial year ended December 31, 2018, we estimate that approximately 95% of revenue from our top 14 agrochemicals exclusives in Custom Manufacturing, which represented approximately 54% of our total revenue in Custom Manufacturing, were not exposed to raw material price fluctuations. As part of our quality management procedures, we maintain long-term relationships with suppliers. We also conduct ongoing performance assessment and benchmarking as part of our supplier selection process. In the event of supply shortages, we may seek to purchase raw materials or other products from our competitors. From time to time, we also enter into product swap agreements with key competitors to guarantee that our customers can be supplied at all times, even during facility maintenance or turnarounds.

The EU requires control of the use of chemical products within its borders, requiring all affected industries to ensure and demonstrate the safe manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. REACH is the Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006), which came into effect on June 1, 2007, and which has been fully applicable since June 1, 2009, requiring the registration of all chemical substances or preparations manufactured in, or imported into, the EU. Its main objectives include improving the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals and ensuring the free circulation of substances on the internal market of the EU. In principle, under REACH, all manufacturers and importers of chemicals must identify and manage risks linked to the substances they manufacture and market. For substances produced or imported in quantities of one ton or more per year per company, manufacturers and importers need to demonstrate that they have appropriately done so by means of a registration dossier, which shall be submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). ECHA may then check that the dossier is compliant with REACH and will evaluate testing proposals to ensure that the proposed assessment of the chemical substances will not result in unnecessary testing, especially on animals. Where appropriate, authorities may also select substances of concern for a broader evaluation. REACH requires formal documentation of the relevant data required for hazard assessments for each substance registered as well as development of risk assessments for their registered uses. Under certain circumstances, the performance of a chemical safety assessment is mandatory and a chemical safety report assuring the safe use of the substance must be submitted. If there is no registration of the substance, it is impermissible to produce this chemical in, or import it into, the EU (i.e., the “no data no market” principle). Existing registrations need to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated with respect to new scientific knowledge. Furthermore, purchasers of registered chemicals must inform their sellers about the intended use of the chemicals, as the importer or producer must add this information to its documentation. 114 ----- REACH also provides for an authorization system aiming to ensure that substances of very high concern are adequately controlled and progressively substituted by safer substances or technologies or only used where society benefits overall from using the substance. These substances are prioritized and gradually listed on the so-called candidate list for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV to REACH. Once they are included, the industry has to submit applications to ECHA on authorization for continued use of these substances which are otherwise prohibited. In addition, EU authorities can impose restrictions on the manufacture, use or placing on the market of substances causing an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. Manufacturers and importers must provide their downstream users with the risk information they need to be able to use the substance safely. This is done via the classification and labeling system and Safety Data Sheets (SDS). Therefore, the REACH Regulation was accompanied by legislation providing for a comprehensive system on the classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 and related European legislation). We produce and use considerable quantities of substances that are subject to the REACH regulation. We believe that we have complied with our current obligations under REACH. As part of a large consortium, the Group is a co-registrant of registrations for chlorine, glycolic acid, MCA, SMCA and sodium hypochlorite. None of our products affected by substances of very high concern (“SVHC”) are listed in the official SVHC-List of the ECHA. Our biocidal business is particularly regulated by the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012 (“BPR”), which entered into force on September 1, 2013. Biocidal products are used to protect humans, animals, materials or articles against harmful organisms, like pests or bacteria. Under the BPR, the approval of active substances takes place at the EU level and the subsequent authorization of the biocidal products at the EU member state level. Companies have to apply for the approval of an active substance by submitting a dossier to the ECHA. Following the approval of an active substance, companies wishing to place biocidal products on the market in a EU member state have to apply for product authorization. We carefully monitor our compliance with the BPR and are not aware of any infringements in connection with our operations or products. _Germany_ We are, inter alia, subject to various notification and labeling requirements and have to comply with certain safety obligations arising under the German Chemicals Act (Chemikaliengesetz), which mainly reflects and accompanies REACH at the national level, but which also establishes further national requirements. As the production and handling of chemicals is the Group’s core business, these obligations are of significant importance for its operations. The Ordinance on Information Requirements relating to Poisonous Substances (Giftinformationsverordnung) was released under the German Chemicals Act. It requires persons who market certain chemical products, in particular biocidal products, to provide information needed for precautionary safety and curative measures and emergency situations. The Ordinance on the Prohibition of Certain Hazardous Substances (Chemikalien-Verbotsverordnung) bans or restricts the marketing of dangerous materials, preparations, and products. This ordinance contains requirements that must be complied with when marketing dangerous materials, such as proof of competence and notification, information and recording duties. _Switzerland_ We are subject to various notification, labeling and marketing requirements under Swiss law and must comply with certain safety obligations arising under, among others, the Federal Chemicals Act (Chemikaliengesetz), the Ordinance on Hazardous Substances (Verordnung über Schutz vor gefährlichen _Stoffen und Zubereitungen, Chemikalienverordnung) and the Ordinance on Biocide Products_ (Biozidprodukteverordnung). Only certain registered biocide products are permitted to be placed on the market. _Finland_ We are, inter alia, subject to notification and labeling requirements and have to comply with certain safety obligations arising under the Finnish Chemicals Act (Kemikaalilaki). This legislation mainly reflects and accompanies REACH at the national level in Finland, but also establishes further national requirements. 115 ----- _United States_ The Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) imposes requirements on persons and companies that manufacture, process, distribute, use or dispose of regulated chemicals. Among other things, under the TSCA the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has the authority to: (i) require testing of chemicals; (ii) undertake pre-market review and impose restrictions upon new chemicals; (iii) limit or prohibit the manufacture, use, distribution and disposal of chemical substances; (iv) impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements; and (v) regulate the export and import of chemical substances. In recent years, the EPA has also undertaken efforts to more stringently and comprehensively enforce the TSCA. For example, the EPA has issued “chemical action plans” and, in 2014, has identified an updated work plan for further review and risk assessment of additional chemicals over the next several years. The EPA may impose civil and criminal liability for TSCA violations. In June 2016, legislation significantly amending the TSCA was enacted into law, entitled the “Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act”. The legislation mandates that the EPA conduct safety evaluations for all chemicals in active commerce and requires new chemicals and significant new uses of chemicals to be deemed likely to be safe before entering the market. While the full impact of these amendments to the TSCA remains uncertain, it is possible that they could trigger risk screening of certain of our products by the EPA, and this risk screening could lead to new or more stringent regulatory obligations and/or restrictions, including, potentially, prohibitions on manufacture and sale of certain products. On December 19, 2016, the EPA published a list of ten chemical substances that are the subject of the EPA’s initial chemical risk evaluations, as required by the TSCA, and more such lists are slated to be published in the future. Such regulations could result in key raw materials, chemicals, or other substances being classified or reclassified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, users of our products, or our employees. Such reclassification of one or more of our raw materials or products could affect its availability or marketability, result in a ban on its purchase or sale, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with notification, labelling, or handling requirements. In addition, numerous state, local and industry groups have implemented so-called green chemistry or similar chemicals focused initiatives to identify, prioritize, and restrict existing chemicals. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) recently phased in a hazard communication regulation intended to harmonize the U.S. system of Material Safety Data sheet hazard information with the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. OSHA has also indicated an intent to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in December 2019, which would initiate an update to the Hazard Communication Standard. These or other similar future changes to chemicals regulation in the U.S. could place additional substantial regulatory burdens on the industry. Food Ingredients and Feed Additives _European Union_ With regard to our business on vitamins, we are subject to European and national law on food safety providing for special obligations on the production, marketing, sale and labeling of food ingredients. For example, Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 sets out the general principles of EU food ingredient law and requires, among other things, that food and feed ingredients be traceable to their source. Detailed rules also exist for the authorization of novel foods within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 on novel foods as well as food ingredients based on genetically modified organisms within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed. In addition, there are a number of regulations relating to food improvement agents, including provisions and authorization procedures relating to food additives, food enzymes and flavoring, as well as food ingredients with flavoring properties. Specific limits exist for the use of pesticides and other contaminants, such as dioxins polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals and mycotoxins in foodstuffs, foods and food ingredients. Separate legislation regulates the additives that may be used in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. When used as food additives, our products may be required to comply with certain sector specific regulations, such as the European Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives objecting at a high level of consumer health protection by restricting the use of food additives. Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs sets out criteria for the measures and conditions necessary to control hazards and to ensure a sufficient state for human consumption of a foodstuff taking into account its intended use. Under the regulation, food business operators have to satisfy certain hygiene requirements by, among other things, notifying the competent authority, in the 116 ----- manner specified, of each establishment under its control that carries out any of the stages of production, processing and distribution of food, with a view to the registration of each such establishment. Moreover, each food business operator is obligated to put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures based on the “HACCP” (Hazard analysis and critical control points) principles. _Germany_ In addition to European regulations, EU member states may have enacted further national legislation on regulation of food and feed stuff. For example, the German Food and Feed Code (Lebensmittel- und _Futtermittelgesetzbuch) primarily aims to protect consumers from food and feed stuff related health risks. It_ also applies to the production and distribution of cosmetics. The German Ordinance on Animal Nutrition (Futtermittelverordnung) refers to this register and sets forth various specific rules. _Finland_ In addition to the applicable EU regulation, food and feed safety, food quality assurance, hygiene of food stuffs and food labelling are regulated by the Finnish Act on Food Stuffs (Elintarvikelaki) and the Decree of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on the Provision of Food Information to Consumers (Maa-ja _metsätalousministeriön asetus elintarviketietojen antamisesta kuluttajille). Switzerland_ The Federal Act on Foodstuffs and Utility Articles (Lebensmittelgesetz) aims, inter alia, to protect consumer health and provide consumer information. A detailed framework of ordinances is in place for food or nutrition, its components and additives. Cosmetics _European Union_ Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, which came into effect on July 11, 2013, requires producers to carry out a safety assessment of cosmetics and their ingredients prior to their sale on the market. The same regulation also contains lists of substances that are prohibited or restricted in connection with the manufacturing of cosmetics. _Germany_ In addition to applicable EU regulations, the German Food and Feed Code (Lebensmittel- und _Futtermittelgesetzbuch) described above also applies to articles of daily use, such as cosmetics. Finland_ In addition to applicable EU regulations, the Finnish Act on Cosmetic Products (Laki kosmeettisista _valmisteista) is also applicable to cosmetics. The Act mainly reflects the European Regulation, but also sets_ out further sanctions and criminal liability for breaches of the Act or the European Regulation. _Switzerland_ The Federal Act on Foodstuffs and Utility Articles (Lebensmittelgesetz), described above, also applies on articles of daily use, such as cosmetics.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.34,Regulation of Manufacturing Sites and Storage Sites,5.34.1,Emissions,"_European Union_ In many countries, the emission of air pollutants, noise, odors and vibrations is governed by specific laws and regulations. The operation of industrial facilities is typically subject to permits, and operators of these facilities are required to prevent impermissible emissions. Operators of facilities are required to maintain all installations in compliance with the respective permits in terms of the reduction of certain emissions and implementation of safety measures. In some cases, a continuous improvement or retrofitting of installations to maintain facilities at “state of the art” safety standards may be required. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and operators may be required to submit emission reports on a regular basis. Non-compliance with maximum emission levels may result in administrative fines. 117 ----- In January 2011, the European Directive 2010/75/EC on industrial emissions (“IED Directive”) entered into force. It sets out rules on the prevention and control of pollution from industrial activities and includes rules aimed at reducing emissions into air, water and land, as well as preventing the generation of waste in order to achieve a high level of overall environmental protection. Starting January 2013, EU member states had to comply with the emissions limits for certain industries. Under the IED Directive and its implementing law, inter alia, the chemical industry has to consider thresholds regarding various polluting substances, such as carbon monoxide and dust including fine particulate matter. Furthermore, the IED Directive amended European Directive 2008/1/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control which aimed to define best available techniques (“BAT”) as binding standards. In order to define BAT and the BAT-associated environmental performance at the EU level, the European Commission organizes an exchange of information with experts from Member States, industry and environmental organizations. This process results in the publication of BAT Reference Documents (“BREFs”). BAT is a dynamic concept and continues to evolve as new measures and techniques emerge, science and technologies develop and new or emerging industrial processes are introduced. In order to reflect such developments and the consequences of such developments for BAT, BREFs are subject to periodic review and update. That is why the IED Directive requires a periodical review of all conditions in existing permits and, if necessary, amendments of these conditions to ensure compliance with the IED Directive. We continuously monitor compliance with the IED Directive and relevant BREFs on an ongoing basis. For example, under the BREF for the production of chlor-alkali the mercury cell technology was phased out by the end of 2017 and we converted our mercury cell plant in Pratteln to a membrane cell plant in 2016. _Germany_ By way of amendments to member state laws, including, for example, the German Federal Emissions Control Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz), the German Federal Water Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz) and the German Act on Recycling (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz), the IED Directive has been implemented in the EU member states, resulting in thresholds, authorization requirements and supervisory obligations for new and existing facilities. Although the IED Directive and its implementation provide transitional provisions, under German law, once a new industry standard becomes binding, existing permits, which are not in compliance with such standard, will not be grandfathered but will be adjusted with respect to the new, binding standard. In order to meet stricter requirements, in particular for dust, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur monoxide and total organic carbon, we may need to incur capital expenditures in order to improve our filter systems and firing processes. _Finland_ The IED Directive was implemented in Finland by the renewal of the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Ympäristönsuojelulaki) in 2014. As a result of the implementation, certain stricter environmental obligations for polluters, more effective supervision of compliance and a supervision fee to be paid by parties holding an environmental permit were included in the Environmental Act. The Climate Change Act (Ilmastolaki) entered into force in June 2015, introducing the emission cuts agreed on in international treaties and regulated in EU legislation, mainly concerning emissions outside the emissions trading sector. The Climate Change Act also introduced a national Finnish commitment to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050. The Climate Change Act is, above all, intended as a law regarding the public administration’s planning of climate policy. It may, however, impact other Finnish legislation directly regulating the operations of the Finnish companies in the future. _Switzerland_ The Federal Environmental Protection Act (Umweltschutzgesetz) and implementing legislation aims to limit harmful impacts such as air and soil pollution, noise, vibrations, radiation, water pollution or other interference in water, caused by the construction and operation of installations, by the handling of substances, organisms or waste, or by the cultivation of the soil resulting, inter alia, in thresholds, authorization requirements and supervisory obligations for new and existing facilities. Our production plants emit dust, odors, and hazardous and non-hazardous substances into the air. We are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In particular, we believe that we hold all permits that are legally required to operate our sites. We may, however, be required to incur significant capital expenditures to upgrade production plants by installing or improving technical equipment to comply with maximum emission levels that may become applicable in the future. 118 ----- _United States_ The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and its implementing regulations, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations govern emissions of pollutants into the air and impose permitting and emission control requirements. Standards promulgated pursuant to the CAA may require that U.S. facilities install controls at, or make other changes to, facilities. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be significant. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements of the CAA and its implementing regulations could result in substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions. The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain permits for the construction, modification, and operation of our equipment, comply with permit requirements, and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our facilities. Measures may need to be taken to comply with various regulations specific to our operations, such as: National Ambient Air Quality Standards applicable to emissions of criteria pollutants such as particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds; the New Source Review Program requiring that new or modified sources install stringent control technology. We may incur substantial capital expenditures to maintain compliance with these and other air emission regulations that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.34,Regulation of Manufacturing Sites and Storage Sites,5.34.2,Climate Change and Emission Trading,"At the international level, many nations have agreed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the ‘‘Kyoto Protocol.’’ These GHGs include methane, a primary component of natural gas, carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products (among other sources). In December 2009, 27 nations signed the Copenhagen Accord, which includes a non-binding commitment to reduce GHG emissions. At the December 2015 Conference of Parties in Paris, certain members of the international community negotiated a treaty known as the “Paris Agreement”, which entered into force in November 2016 and will require developed countries to set targets for emissions reductions once the Agreement is adopted by those individual countries within their respective national or federal law. _European Union_ In 2003, the European Parliament adopted the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC which was transformed into national law at the level of the EU member states. Through the introduction of a trading system for emission allowances, the EU intends to considerably reduce the output of greenhouse gases. Industrial sites to which the EU Emission Trading System (“ETS”) applies receive a certain number of allowances to emit greenhouse gases and must surrender one allowance for each ton of greenhouse gases emitted. Sites that emit fewer tons of greenhouse gases than their allowances cover are allowed to sell their excess allowances in the open market, whereas those that emit more are required to buy additional allowances through the ETS. Participation in this system has been mandatory since 2005 for all industries with high energy consumption levels. Auctioning has been the principal method of allocating emission allowances since 2013. Starting with the third trading period (2013 through 2020), there are no longer any national allocation plans, rather an EU-wide cap set by the European Commission and uniform allocation rules for all member states. Under the currently applicable ETS, the EU-wide cap is lowered annually by a linear factor of 1.74% of the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU in the second trading period (2008 through 2012). Beginning in the fourth trading period (2021-2030), the cap will be lowered by 2.2% per year to achieve the target of cutting EU emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2030, as agreed upon by the European Council in October 2014 as part of the 2030 climate and energy framework. Emission allowance auctioning was introduced for the manufacturing sector beginning in 2013. Furthermore, the overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge has been significantly reduced for the second trading and third trading periods. The quantity of such emission allowances are generally reduced from 80% of total allowances in 2013 to 30% in 2020. Pursuant to the amended version of the ETS, as modified by the 2018 Directive (EU) 2018/410, the 30% of free allocations will be reduced after 2026 to 0% by 2030. As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed their emission allowances will have to purchase a significant, and steadily increasing, share of emission allowances in auctions, which may result in substantial additional cost for such companies. To date, the Group’s emissions have not exceeded the thresholds triggering the applicability of the ETS. However, we closely observe the emission trading and its legal amendments by the EU as the thresholds may be decreased by the European Union and the regime may become applicable to our operations in the future. 119 ----- _Germany_ In Germany, the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC has been implemented by the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz), which provides the basis of the German emission trading scheme. Moreover, plant operators are required to submit monitoring reports on a regular basis. _Finland_ In Finland the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC has been implemented by the enactment of the Finnish Emission Trading Act (Päästökauppalaki). Under the Act, certain plant operators have to apply for emissions allowances, monitor emission levels and fulfil reporting duties towards the relevant authorities. _Switzerland_ The Federal CO2 Emission Reduction Act (CO2-Gesetz), inter alia, provides for levies for the use of fossil fuels and energy sources for energy production as a measure to achieve the national greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Exemptions are available for companies in certain industries obliged or opting to participate in the Swiss emissions trading system or entering into emission reduction undertakings with the Federal Government. The Federal CO2 Emissions Reduction Act is currently undergoing a comprehensive revision which, if implemented as proposed, will, inter alia result in further streamlining of the Swiss emissions trading system with that of the EU with the aim of linking the two systems. _United States_ Regulation of GHGs in the United States is currently subject to complicated domestic and international political, policy and economic dynamics, and the regulatory landscape is rapidly changing. Current and prospective United States operations may result in emissions of GHGs and may be energyintensive and require the purchase or electricity, the generation of which often results in emissions of GHGs. The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment. In response, the EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA regulating emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants and industrial facilities. The EPA’s regulations require such sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) prior to construction or a major modification, as well as Title V operating permits. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits are required to implement ‘‘best available control technology,’’ which can include carbon efficiency standards, GHG emission concentration limits, specific technology requirements or other measures. In June 2019, the EPA implemented the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which provides for controls on emissions associated with power generation. Future changes could re-introduce stricter requirements (such as previously existed under the “Clean Power Plan”), which would increase our operating costs. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States on an annual basis. We may be required to monitor GHG emissions from prospective United States operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule and may also be required to ensure our monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.34,Regulation of Manufacturing Sites and Storage Sites,5.34.3,European Union Regulation of Hazardous Incidents,"With effect from June 1, 2015, operators of facilities storing hazardous goods in larger quantities are required to comply with safety standards set forth in Directive 2012/18/EU on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances (“Seveso III Directive”), successor of Council Directive 96/82/EC. The provisions are designed to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances (such as emissions, fires and larger explosions) and to limit detrimental consequences in the event of an accident. The degree of additional safety requirements depends on the amounts of various classes of hazardous substances stored in the relevant facility. For this purpose, the Seveso III Directive differentiates between “lower-tier establishments” and “upper-tier establishments” where dangerous substances are present in quantities equal to or in excess of the quantities listed in the Annex of the Seveso-III Directive. According to the Seveso-III Directive, the operator is obliged to take all necessary measures to prevent major accidents and to limit their consequences for human health and the environment. The operator has to send a notification to the competent authority, including information such as the immediate 120 ----- environment of the establishment, and factors likely to cause a major accident or to aggravate the consequences thereof including, where available, details of neighboring establishments, of sites that fall outside the scope of this directive, areas and developments that could be the source of or increase the risk or consequences of a major accident and of domino effects. The operator is required to document the establishment’s major-accident prevention policy (“MAPP”), ensure that it is properly implemented, periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated, at least every five years. The operator must also prepare an internal emergency plan and supply the competent authority with relevant information to prepare an external emergency plan. For upper-tier establishments, the operator has to produce a safety report for the purpose of demonstrating that a MAPP and an associated safety management system have been implemented and ensure that all persons likely to be affected by a major accident receive regularly and in the most appropriate form, without having to request it, clear and intelligible information on safety measures and requisite behavior in the event of a major accident. The EU member states have to ensure that appropriate safety distances between establishments covered by the Seveso-III Directive and residential areas, buildings and areas of public use, recreational areas, and, as far as possible, major transport routes are maintained. We may be subject to restrictions, for instance, in respect of site locations of new plants and expansions to our existing plants. At our sites and facilities, we frequently handle and use hazardous substances in the meaning of the national laws. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with the requirements, if insufficient protection against spills or uncontrolled release of substances are identified in the future, we could incur capital expenditures for technical improvements or maintenance to ensure future compliance. At some of our sites, asbestos has been used in the construction of buildings. Currently, we are not aware of any requirement under applicable environmental laws that requires the remediation of bound or encapsulated asbestos, and we are not aware of any friable asbestos on the Group’s sites. If, however, a building is to be demolished or refurbished, precautions may be necessary and the material must be properly disposed by licensed contractors. _Germany_ The provisions of former Directive 96/82/EC were mainly implemented into German law through the Federal Hazardous Incident Ordinance (Störfall-Verordnung). Although the Seveso-III Directive was required to be transposed into German law by May 31, 2015, the transposition took longer than expected, and the new law entered into force on January 14, 2017. This included amendments of the German Federal Emission Control Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz) and the German Environmental Impact Assessment Act (Gesetz über die Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung). Among other things, new permit, notification and information requirements have been introduced. _Finland_ The Act on Safe Handling of Dangerous Chemicals and Explosives (Laki vaarallisten kemikaalien ja _räjähteiden käsittelyn turvallisuudesta), the Government Decree on Supervision of Handling and Storage of_ Dangerous Chemicals (Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten kemikaalien käsittelyn ja varastoinnin _valvonnasta) and the Government Decree on Safety Obligations on Industrial Handling and Storage of_ Dangerous Chemicals (Valtioneuvoston asetus vaarallisten kemikaalien teollisen käsittelyn ja varastoinnin _turvallisuusvaatimuksista) contain provisions relating to on-site inspections by relevant agencies and the_ obligation to compile and regularly update safety, rescue and evacuation plans. _Switzerland_ The Ordinance on Hazardous Incidents (Störfallverordnung) aims at protecting populations and environments of damages resulting from hazardous incidents. Among other requirements, production facilities which exceed certain thresholds provided under the Ordinance on Hazardous Incidents must take appropriate measures to reduce the hazard potential, prevent accidents and limit their effects and file a report with the competent authority indicating the quantity of hazardous substances stored in excess of the relevant thresholds and the expected damage in the event of an incident. _United States_ Prospective United States manufacturing facilities are or may be subject to the EPA’s Risk Management Program (“RMP”) under the CAA, which requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute or store certain highly hazardous chemicals to develop a risk management plan and program for accidental 121 ----- releases of such chemicals. RMP also requires facilities to assess potential impacts to off-site populations in the event of a credible worst-case release and to document the policies, procedures, equipment and work practices in place to mitigate identified risks. Similar risk management requirements are imposed upon our facilities under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act “EPCRA”), which contains chemical emergency response planning, accident release and other reporting and notification requirements which may be applicable to our prospective U.S. manufacturing facility.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Its provisions on the collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste requires the EU member states to take appropriate measures for prevention of waste in the first place and to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health or causing harm to the environment. Under the Waste Framework Directive, the EU member states have to include permitting, registration and inspection requirements. In most jurisdictions where we operate, we are subject to statutory provisions regarding waste management. These provisions may govern permissible methods of, and responsibility for, the generation, handling, possession, discharge and recycling of waste depending, among other things, on the dangers posed by the waste. In particular, the discharge of waste is often restricted to licensed facilities. In many European jurisdictions, plants must use licensed contractors for the disposal of hazardous or nonhazardous waste. _Germany_ Under the German Act on Recycling (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz), generators, owners, collectors and transporters of waste must demonstrate to the competent authority and to other parties that they have properly disposed of hazardous waste (gefährliche Abfälle) by proof of waste disposal (Entsorgungsnachweis). Documentation requirements include certain details regarding the handling, type, amount and origin of hazardous waste. _Finland_ In Finland the Waste Framework Directive has been implemented through the enactment of the Finnish Waste Act (Jätelaki) and the Government Decree on Waste (Valtioneuvoston asetus jätteistä), which includes detailed regulations for the handling, labelling and transportation of waste. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable waste management laws and continuously attempt to reduce waste at our sites. Moreover, all of our sites comply with the requirements of ISO 14001 and the Eco- management and Audit Scheme. _Switzerland_ The general principles on the disposal of waste are outlined in the Federal Environmental Protection Act (Umweltschutzgesetz) and the Ordinance on Dealing with Waste (Verordnung über den Verkehr mit _Abfällen). The provisions on the federal level partially delegate duties to the cantons, and accordingly the_ respective cantonal laws on waste apply in addition. Hazardous waste (Sonderabfälle) is generally subject to specific prevention and disposal requirements. _United States_ The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) regulates the generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. Under the RCRA, persons may be liable at sites where the past or present storage, handling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where disposal occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the disposal occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under the RCRA is strict and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. 122 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.34,Regulation of Manufacturing Sites and Storage Sites,5.34.5,Regulation on the Use of Water Resources,"We are subject to several laws at the supranational and national levels relating to the use of ground and surface water in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The Water Framework Directive No. 2000/60/EC, establishing a framework for European Community action in the field of water policy, commits EU member states to achieving a good qualitative and quantitative status of all water bodies by 2015, a deadline that can be postponed to 2027 if various conditions in the legislation are applied. Its main goals include expanding the scope of water protection to all waters, including surface waters and groundwater, water management based on river basins, a “combined approach” of emission limit values and quality standards. According to the latest report from the European Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, dated 26 February 2019, full compliance with the objectives of EU water legislation before the final 2027 deadline is very challenging. The report states that, although further measures will be taken until 2021 by the EU member states, many others will be needed beyond 2021. In most of the EU member states, the use of water requires a permit and is strictly regulated to avoid any contamination of ground or surface water, such as through the disposal of sewage or waste water and the handling of potentially dangerous materials. For example, the discharge of any pollutant substances into the surface water may be subject to a permit whereas the discharge of any such substances into the ground water may generally be impermissible. Under the national law of some EU member states in which we operate, water permits may be granted for specific periods of time, or may be reviewed after a certain period, and, therefore, must be renewed frequently. In certain circumstances such water permits may be revoked without compensation. For these activities appropriate permits to use and discharge water must be obtained and maintained during the operation of our plants and sites. We currently hold all required water permits. However, such requirements, as well as the terms of the permits we hold, may materially affect our operations by restricting the discharge of pollutant substances and waste water exceeding certain temperatures and certain maximum levels, including storm-water run- offs, directly or indirectly into public waters. We have been, and will continue to be, required to incur significant capital expenditures and operating cost in order to maintain and upgrade our production sites and facilities to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits, and to obtain and maintain all necessary permits. In Switzerland, the Federal Act on Water Protection (Gewässerschutzgesetz) and the respective ordinance (Gewässerschutzverordnung) aims to protect ground and surface water from pollution and other harmful impact and hence, inter alia regulates the disposal of sewage or waste water and the handling of potentially dangerous materials and requires cantons to implement measures for groundwater protection Furthermore, the use of public waters generally requires a permit or concession by the competent authorities. _United States_ The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and subsequent amendments, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a CWA permit. The CWA also requires many facilities to develop and maintain plans for preventing and responding to spills of hazardous substances, called Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans, and certain high volume hazardous substance handling/storage facilities are required to prepare and maintain a more extensive plan called a Facility Response Plan. Breaches of the CWA can result in administrative, civil or criminal sanctions.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

In that respect, we are subject to national provisions that may impose obligations related to remediation measures or compensation on us. _Germany_ Under the German Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz) and several regulations promulgated thereunder, owners of land and operators of facilities are required to prevent any contamination of the soil by taking necessary precautions. If any soil contamination (schädliche _Bodenveränderung) has occurred, or where pollution was caused in the past (Altlasten, “past-pollution”),_ 123 ----- owners of land, operators of facilities, the party having caused the pollution or its universal successor (Gesamtrechtsnachfolger) and the previous owner if such owner transferred title to the real property after March 1, 1999 and knew, or should have known, of the contamination or past pollution, may be held responsible for investigation and remediation measures and cost thereof. In certain cases, a party may even be held liable for the entire cost of remediation, irrespective of its fault, the lawfulness of disposal or the actions of other parties. Non-compliance with the obligations under the applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative fines or, in certain cases, criminal liability. _Finland_ Under the Finnish Environmental Protection Act (Ympäristönsuojelulaki), the polluter is primarily responsible for remedying pollution to groundwater or soil. However, if the polluter cannot be determined or found or is unable or neglects to carry out its clean-up obligations, the current possessor (i.e., tenant or owner) of the contaminated site can be held liable for reasonable remedial measures if the possessor knew, or should have known, about the contamination at the time the site was acquired, or if the owner consented to the polluting activity. The Finnish Environmental Protection Act applies only to pollution that has occurred on or after January 1, 1994. For contamination that occurred before this date, liability is based on the then applicable Waste Act (Jätelaki) and Waste Management Act (Jätehuoltolaki) and, in certain cases, also the Water Act and the Health Care Act (Terveydenhoitolaki). _Switzerland_ The Federal Environmental Protection Act (Umweltschutzgesetz) and implementing legislation requires owners of land and operators of facilities to prevent soil contamination by taking necessary precautions. According to the Ordinance on the Remediation of Polluted Sites (Altlasten-Verordnung), sites which have, or which are expected to have, a harmful and adverse impact on soil, must be registered in a special cadaster and adhere to certain examination, monitoring and remediation measures. This is particularly relevant if the owner or operator intends to modify its facilities, which is generally permitted only if such modification would not lead to the requirement of remediation. If a facility does require remediation, such modification is only permitted if it is undertaken in connection with the facility’s remediation. _United States_ Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state laws, certain persons may be liable at sites where or from a release of hazardous substances has occurred or is threatened. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, retroactive and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

CABB’s obligations under it reach beyond the rule of German civil liability for ground water and soil contamination and cover environmental losses that may not be eligible for compensation under other laws. The obligations and liabilities under the German Environmental Damage Act constitute public law obligations to avoid or remedy environmental damage. In addition, non-governmental environmental organizations may institute legal proceedings in the event the relevant authority has failed to take the necessary steps for enforcement. _Finland_ The Finnish Act on Compensation for Environmental Damage (Laki ympäristövahinkojen korvaamisesta) establishes a compensatory damages regime for personal injuries, damage to property and in certain cases for financial losses sustained from pollution of water, air or soil as well as from noise, vibrations, radiation, light, heat, odor or from other similar nuisances. Furthermore, the act regulates compensation for clean-up 124 ----- costs as well as preventive and remediation measures. The person whose activity has caused the environmental damage, a person comparable to the person carrying out the activity causing the environmental damage, or the person to whom the activity which caused the environmental damage has been assigned, if the assignee knew or should have known, at the time of assignment, about the loss or the nuisance or the threat of the same, is liable to compensate for the damage. Furthermore, our Finnish companies are required to carry insurance to comply with the Finnish Environmental Damage Insurance Act (Laki ympäristövahinkovakuutuksesta) which establishes a complementary compensation scheme if the party liable for the environmental damage is insolvent or cannot be identified. _Switzerland_ Under the Federal Environmental Protection Act (Umweltschutzgesetz) the operator of an establishment or installation posing a particular risk to the environment is liable for any damage resulting from harmful impact as a result of the realization of that risk regardless of fault, unless loss or damage was caused by force majeure or by gross negligence on the part of the injured party or a third party.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

At the international level, the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road as of September 30, 1957 (Accord européen relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereuses par Route, “ADR”), as amended on January 1, 2019, includes provisions applicable to the carriage of dangerous goods on roads. Pursuant to the ADR, dangerous goods, as a general rule, may be carried internationally in road vehicles subject to compliance with a number of conditions, such as packaging and labeling requirements. Specific dangerous goods (e.g., goods which are poisonous and explosive at the same time) are excluded from carriage on the road. The ADR has been implemented and supplemented by many countries in which we operate. For example, in Germany the ADR is implemented by the Ordinance on Hazardous Goods for Road, Rail and Inland Shipping (Gefahrgutverordnung Straße, Eisenbahn und Binnenschifffahrt), an ordinance passed under the Hazardous Goods Act (Gefahrgutbeförderungsgesetz).

Under such laws and regulations, employers typically must establish the conditions and the flow of work in a manner that effectively prevents dangers to employees. In particular, employers must observe certain medical and hygienic standards and comply with certain occupational health and safety requirements, such as permissible maximum levels for noise at the work place, the use of personal protective equipment and requirements relating to maximum temperatures and air ventilation. _Switzerland_ The Federal Employment Act (Arbeitsgesetz) states that employers are responsible for taking appropriate measures to protect their employees’ health. Ordinance 3 to the Employment Act specifies the detailed duties, for instance regarding the construction of the buildings which are used by the employees, hygienic conditions, protective equipment and working clothes. _United States_ Any current and future United States operations are, or will be, subject to OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (“EPCRA”) and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Of particular relevance to any prospective United States manufacturing operations, OSHA’s standard on Process Safety Management (“PSM”) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals contains requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous chemicals. OSHA’s PSM regulations are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of unexpected releases of toxic, reactive, 125 ----- flammable or explosive liquids and gases in chemical processes. PSM covers facilities that deal with any of certain listed toxic and reactive chemicals and flammable liquids and gases in amounts over specified threshold quantities. PSM requires process hazard analysis, a systematic study of events that could cause hazardous substance releases and the safeguards to prevent them. Employers must perform an initial hazard analysis on all processes covered by the standard and update the analysis at least every five years. Among other things, PSM also mandates written operating procedures, employee training, pre-startup safety reviews, evaluation of mechanical integrity of equipment, written procedures for managing change, investigation of incidents involving releases or near misses of covered chemicals, emergency action plans and compliance audits.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The EEG 2014 specified the transition to an auction system for most technologies which has been finished with the current version EEG 2017. The remuneration for the generation of renewable energy is balanced by a levy that is imposed on the consumers of energy (“EEG-levy”). The EEG provides for certain exemptions from the EEG-levy, such as for energy intensive industries. The exemptions in the EEG have to meet the requirements established by the Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The EEG 2017 lowered the required electricity cost intensity for such exemptions from 17% to 14% as of 2017 for certain industries. However, in light of a recent judgment of the European Court of Justice of March 28, 2019, according to which the EEG 2012 did not constitute State aid, it is conceivable that the legal framework will further be revised by the German legislator taking into account that the strict requirements under State aid law do not apply to the German funding system. As we qualify as an energy intensive industry under the EEG, our German sites currently benefit from exemptions from the EEG-levy. Although we continue to benefit from this exemption, it is not known if the EEG will be amended in the future. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether we may have to pay the full EEG-levy in the future or whether certain of our production levels may be re-classified in the future, which could result in a partial loss of the EEG-levy.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will: - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid; - be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on,, and, commencing on, 2020; - be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on the,, and immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed on the aggregate principal amount outstanding.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes. 155 ----- “Determination Date” with respect to an Interest Period, means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. “EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page as of 11.00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the Eurozone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11.00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Eurozone interbank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.

If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. If, in any case, that rate determined in accordance with the above is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero. If the Issuer determines in good faith prior to any Determination Date, that: 1. there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR; 2. EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently; 3. there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR; 4. an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or 5. it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent of the Issuer to calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR, a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Floating Rate Notes (and any applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent, at least two Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall, in all cases, not be less than zero. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread). Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread). “Eurozone” means the region comprising member states of the European Union that adopt the euro. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include , 2020. 156 ----- “Rate Determination Agent” means an independent financial institution of international standing or an independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed by the Issuer at the expense of the Issuer. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (1) €1.0 million and (2) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Reuters Screen EURIBOR 01 Page” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Senior Secured Note outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Notes is permitted under any applicable law. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide 169 ----- certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the _Senior Secured Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:_ (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Note Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to, any Senior Secured Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this issuance of Senior Secured Notes) and limited solely in the case of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded from the obligation to pay an Additional Amount. The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such 170 ----- redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Senior Secured Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer. A Holder willing to tender Senior Secured Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of its election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once such tender has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall promptly credit the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes so tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Senior Secured Note from such Holder’s Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable) account. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict 171 ----- with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a change of control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Revolving Facility and would obligate the Senior Notes Issuer to make an offer to holders thereof to repurchase any Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on _Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value_ thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any EUR-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the EUR Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred or first committed (whichever yields the lower EUR Equivalent); provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than EUR, and such refinancing would cause the applicable EUR-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such EUR-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the EUR-Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date and (ii) of the Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Completion Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the EUR) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in EUR will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future (the “Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will: - be a general senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”; - be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor, including that Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Facility Agreement and in respect of certain cash management obligations, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes; - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior subordinated Indebtedness of that Guarantor; - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee; - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee or that is secured on a first-priority basis over property and assets that secure such Note Guarantee on a second-priority basis (including that Guarantor’s obligations under the Revolving Facility Agreement and in respect of certain cash management obligations, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such other Indebtedness or obligations; and - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors. 236 ----- The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Facility and the Senior Notes where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the benefit to the creditors, including the Holders of the Senior Notes, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee.

Although the Senior Notes Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Notes Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Notes Indenture.

Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a change of control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the Revolving Facility and would obligate the Issuer to make an offer to holders thereof to repurchase any Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s 250 ----- ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on _Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value_ thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). 254 ----- For purposes of determining compliance with any EUR-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the EUR Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred or first committed (whichever yields the lower EUR Equivalent); provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than EUR, and such refinancing would cause the applicable EUR-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such EUR-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the EUR-Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date and (ii) of the Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Completion Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the EUR) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in EUR will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless (a) in the case of the Issuer, such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes on substantially identical terms or (b) in the case of any Guarantor, such Indebtedness is pari passu in right of payment with the Note Guarantee of the Senior Notes; provided, _however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any_ other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.

Prior to taking any action under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Withholding Tax","For German tax residents (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control is located in Germany), interest payments will be subject to German withholding tax if the Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account with a German branch of a German or non-German bank or financial services institution, a German securities trading company or a German securities trading bank (each, a “Disbursing Agent,” auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%). For individual holders of the Notes who are subject to church tax, an electronic information system for church withholding tax purposes applies in relation to investment income, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the holders will be assessed for church tax. The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest”, Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period provided that the Notes have been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If similar Notes kept or administered in the same custodial account were acquired at different points in time, the Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold first for the purposes of determining the capital gains. Where Notes are acquired and/or sold or redeemed in a currency other than Euro, the sales/redemption price and the acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the foreign exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and the acquisition date respectively with the result that any currency gains or losses are part of the capital gains. If interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e. without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposal are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the collection of interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately. To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the 317 ----- actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries (e.g., Switzerland or Andorra). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must, also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs. In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die _Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be_ withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities. German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met. Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are held or administered in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen). In case of Definitive Registered Notes, payments might be also subject to German withholding tax if the Notes are presented for an over-the-counter-payment to a Disbursing Agent.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer- Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible. The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “—Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or of no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the 318 ----- disposal proceeds (rather than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Capital losses from the Notes held as private assets are tax-recognised irrespective of the holding period of the Notes. The losses may, however, not be used to offset other income like employment or business income but may only be offset against investment income subject to certain limitations. Losses not utilised in one year may be carried forward into subsequent years but may not be carried back into preceding years. The German Federal Ministry of Finance (Bundesministerium der Finanzen) in its decree dated 18 January 2016 (IV C 1 – S 2252/08/10004:017, the “Decree”) (as amended) has taken the position that a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall) and a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) shall, in general, not be treated as a sale, so that losses suffered upon such bad debt loss or waiver shall not be deductible for tax purposes. Further, while the German Federal Ministry of Finance held the view that a disposal (Veräußerung) (and, as a consequence, a tax loss resulting from such disposal) shall not be recognized if (i) the sales price does not exceed the actual transaction costs or (ii) the level of transaction costs is restricted because of a mutual agreement that the transaction costs are calculated by subtracting a certain amount from the sales price, they have recently published an amendment (dated 10 Mai 2019) to the Decree agreeing with a recent decision of the German Federal Court of Finance (dated 12 June 2018, VIII R 32/16) that the recognition of a transaction as a disposal shall not depend on the amount of any consideration or the amount of the transaction costs. Moreover, the German Federal Court of Finance decided that a final bad debt loss with respect to a receivable shall be deductible for tax purposes (court decision dated 24 October 2017, VIII R 13/15); the question whether this also applies to a waiver of a receivable has been left open by the court. However, according to the draft bill of the Federal Ministry of Finance (“Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur weiteren steuerlichen Förderung der Elektromobilität und zur Änderung weiterer steuerlicher Vorschriften”) losses from capital claims of private investors shall now generally not be deductible for tax purposes. However, the legislative process is still in its very beginning and may therefore still be subject to change. Where Notes form part of a trade or business or the income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not settle the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) applicable to the investor. If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method. _Non-Tax Residents_ This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not located in Germany). Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect. As each series of Notes may be subject to a different tax treatment due to the specific terms of such series of Notes, the following section only provides some general information on the possible tax treatment. Tax consequences that may arise if an investor combines certain series of Notes so that he or she derives a certain return are not discussed herein. The law as currently in effect provides for a reduced tax rate for certain investment income. The coalition agreement between the German Christ Democratic Party, the Christian-Social Union and the German Social Democratic Party for the formation of the German federal government provides that the flat tax regime shall be partially abolished. In addition, the German government has passed a draft bill to remove the solidarity surcharge for certain taxpayers up to a maximum amount of their annual taxable income.

However, Estonia has meanwhile stated that it will not participate. The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the current proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain (“Participating Member States”). Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (i) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (ii) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States with respect to the exact wording and timing. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU member states may decide to participate. Besides the proposed FTT, some jurisdictions (e.g., Italy and France) have already introduced a domestic financial transaction tax that may apply to certain dealings in the Securities in certain circumstances. Other jurisdictions may also introduce a domestic financial transaction tax.

The information contained within this section is limited to Luxembourg withholding tax issues and prospective investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject. Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a withholding tax or a tax of a similar nature, or to any other concepts, refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. _Withholding tax_ Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, and subject to the exception below, interest payments (including accrued but unpaid interest) and principal repayments made to non-residents of Luxembourg in the context of the holding, disposal, redemption or repurchase of the Notes which are not profit-sharing will not be subject to any Luxembourg withholding tax, and the Issuers are not under any obligation to pay any additional amounts as a consequences of any withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Issuers become liable for any increased liability to corporation tax (or similar tax) as a consequence of the interest payable under the Notes being treated as non-deductible by the Issuers because of a Hybrid Mismatch, this increased liability to corporation tax (or similar tax) will be (i) treated as being allocated to the holder(s) of Notes because of which such Hybrid Mismatch (whether directly or indirectly) arose and (ii) deducted from any payments to be made to that holder(s) of Notes. 320 ----- As regards Luxembourg resident individuals, the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, as amended, (the “Relibi Law”) provides for a 20 per cent. withholding tax (which is final when Luxembourg resident individuals are acting in the context of the management of their private wealth) on savings income, to the extent such income is paid or allocated by a Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of this law. Under the Relibi Law, payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Payments of interest under the Notes coming within the scope of the Relibi Law will be subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 20%. In addition, pursuant to the Relibi Law, Luxembourg resident individuals who are the beneficial owners of savings income paid or ascribed by a paying agent established outside Luxembourg, in a Member State of either the European Union or the European Economic Area can opt to self-declare and pay a 20%. tax on these savings income. This 20%. tax is final when Luxembourg resident individuals are acting in the context of the management of their private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Relibi Law is assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. _Other Taxes and Duties_ Under current Luxembourg tax law and current administrative practice, it is not necessary that the Notes be notarized, filed, recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in Luxembourg, or that any stamp, transfer, capital, registration or similar tax be paid on or in relation to the execution and delivery of the Notes in accordance therewith or the performance of the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, unless the documents relating to the Notes are (i) physically appended to any document that requires mandatory registration in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au _rang des minutes d’un notaire), or (iii) registered on a voluntary basis. VAT_ There is no Luxembourg value-added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the Notes or in respect of the payment of a redemption amount or principal under the Notes or the transfer of a Note; provided that Luxembourg value added tax may, however, be payable in respect of fees charged for certain services rendered to the issuers, if for Luxembourg value added tax purposes such services are rendered, or are deemed to be rendered, in Luxembourg and an exemption from value added tax does not apply with respect to such services. _Net Wealth tax_ Luxembourg net wealth tax will not be levied on holders of the Notes unless: (i) Such corporate holder of Notes is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for the purpose of the relevant provisions and with the exception of the following entities that are net wealth tax exempt, being (i) undertakings for collective investment (UCITS) within the meaning of the law of December 17, 2010 as amended, (ii) investment company in risk capital (SICAR) within the meaning of the law dated June 15, 2004, as amended, (iii) securitization entities within the meaning of the law dated March 22, 2004 as amended, (iv) specialized investment funds (SIF) within the meaning of the law of February 13, 2007, as amended, (v) private wealth management companies (SPF) within the meaning of the law dated May 11, 2007 as amended and (vi) reserved alternative investment funds (RAIF) within the meaning of the law dated July 23, 2016; or (ii) The relevant Note is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg; However, a securitization company subject to the amended law of March 22, 2004 and a company subject to the amended law of June 15, 2004 on venture capital vehicles, are as from January 1, 2016, subject to a minimum net wealth tax, as well as, RAIF subject to the law of July 23, 2016, provided it is foreseen in the incorporation documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and that (ii) article 48 of the aforementioned law of July 23, 2016 applies. The Relibi Law has abrogated the net wealth tax for Luxembourg resident individuals. _Capital gains tax_ A holder of Notes who derives income from such Note or who realizes a gain on the disposal or redemption thereof will not be subject to Luxembourg taxation on such income or capital gains realized on 321 ----- the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes (subject to the application of the Relibi Law) unless: (i) Such holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in Luxembourg for Luxembourg tax purposes (or for the purposes of the relevant provisions); or (ii) Such income or gain is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof, which is carried on through a permanent establishment, a permanent representative or a fixed base of business in Luxembourg. (iii) Except if, such holder is a corporate holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 on SPF, as amended, or by the law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended, or by the law of February 13, 2007 on specialized investment funds, as amended, or by the law of July 23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds (provided it is not foreseen in the incorporation documents that (i) the exclusive object is the investment in risk capital and that (ii) article 48 of the aforementioned law of July 23, 2016 applies). _Common Reporting Standard_ The OECD has developed a new global standard for the annual automatic exchange of financial information between tax authorities (the “CRS”). The CRS has been implemented in Luxembourg via the law dated December 18, 2015 concerning the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts and tax matters and implementing EU Directive 2014/107/EU and amending EU Directive 2011/16/EU (the “CRS Law”). In addition, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement (“Multilateral Agreement”) to automatically exchange information under the CRS. The CRS requires specified financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which may include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due diligence procedures. A jurisdiction that has signed the Multilateral Agreement may provide this information to other jurisdictions that have signed the Multilateral Agreement. Consequently, holders of Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to any financial institutions through which the payments on the Notes are made. Each prospective investor and each holder of Notes should consult its own tax advisors regarding the requirements under CRS with respect to its own situation as well as the determination of its tax residence.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for discussions on FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax _Compliance Act”). This discussion does not address the impact of the unearned income Medicare_ contribution tax or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (or investors in such entities or arrangements), persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement and persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the applicable series of Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. 322 ----- For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity classified as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged our position, and the notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders would be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on such notes, regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of a note.

Interest generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognize income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the relevant interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual method U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held 323 ----- by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, translated at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid (or deemed paid) by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations.

If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. holder. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid interest, which will be includible in income as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of that amount translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual method taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent attributable to the difference between the exchange rates on the trade date and settlement date. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined using the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined using the spot rate on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of _Interest”) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the_ sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. holder (including an individual), any such long term capital gain will generally be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. tax rules governing foreign currency transactions are complex.

On 26 June 2019, the Swiss Federal Council (Bundesrat) decided to resume the suspended reform of the Swiss withholding tax. Among other things, the Swiss Federal Council plans to include the Swiss withholding tax also on interest investments on foreign securities. From today’s perspective, this requires a change from the existing debtor-based regime to a paying agent-based regime. Under such a paying agent regime, if introduced, a Swiss paying agent would need to levy and pay Swiss withholding tax on interest payments and the like of domestic and foreign securities, provided that the beneficiary is an individual resident in Switzerland. The consultation draft of the Swiss Federal Council announced for autumn 2019 will then be submitted for parliamentary consultation. The actual scope of the Swiss withholding tax reform and the date of its implementation are not yet known. If such a new paying agent-based regime were to be enacted and were to result in the deduction or withholding of the Swiss federal withholding tax by a paying agent in Switzerland on any interest payments in respect of the Notes, neither the Issuers nor the Paying Agents, nor any other paying agent or person would, pursuant to the terms of the offering Notes, be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to the Notes as a result of the deduction or imposition of such withholding tax.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of notes by a Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions 329 ----- between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Plan. In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes.

Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important Information” and “Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors”, “Notice to Certain _European Investors” and “Notice to Residents of Canada.”_ Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers or any Guarantor; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available the Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in point (e) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the 331 ----- prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Luxembourg, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Canada and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Prospective U.S. Investors”, “Notice to _Certain European Investors” and “Notice to Residents of Canada.”_ The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuers will apply to list the Notes on the Securities Official List of the LuxSE, however, the Issuers cannot assure you that the listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes— _There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T + ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the following business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or a person acting on their behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers may also over-allot the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the 332 ----- syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes—There may not be an active trading market for _the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may cease at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are lenders or act as agent under our New Revolving Credit Facility or are Cash Management Providers under our Cash Management Facilities and may enter into hedging arrangements with us in connection with the Transactions, and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. 333 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,Germany,23.1.1,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional competence according to German law; - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of noncompliance with such requirement, (i) the defendant does not invoke such noncompliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the proceedings; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment does not contradict any such judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law; - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment is final under U.S. federal or state law. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above 340 ----- principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

We have been advised by our Finnish counsel that there is no treaty on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Finland. Courts in Finland will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. Under Finnish law, a Finnish title for execution (i.e., a Finnish court judgment) is required for such recognition and enforcement; in seeking a Finnish court judgment or order to such effect, a judgment of a U.S. court will constitute circumstantial evidence of the questions of fact in the case concerned and evidence of the governing law as applied to the matter in dispute. The application by a Finnish court of foreign law in a matter brought before it is subject to (a) the foreign law not being contrary to such mandatory rules of Finnish law that due to their public nature or general interest would be considered applicable irrespective of the agreed choice of law; and (b) the application of the foreign law not resulting in an outcome contrary to the public policy (ordre public) of the Finnish legal system. As to types of damages awarded, punitive or exemplary damages are unenforceable under Finnish law and a Finnish court may only award damages to the extent that they form compensation of actual losses and damages as proven by the claimant. A feature of the Finnish civil procedure is that the burden of proof with respect to any claims presented lies, with certain rare exceptions, with the claimant. A party to legal proceedings in Finland is also ordinarily expected to plead its case primarily on the basis of the evidence in its own possession. U.S. notions of discovery, including the expectation that broadly defined categories of documents and information in the possession of third parties will be readily accessible for use as evidence, are not recognized under Finnish law. The availability of documentation in the possession of counterparties or third parties is limited, and a party seeking to obtain such documents is required to be able to specify such documents with relative precision. Depositions are also a form of taking evidence unknown to Finnish law. In Finland, witness testimony is usually only taken at a separate oral main hearing (comparable to a U.S. trial) after the preparatory phase of the proceedings. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or moratorium as well as other similar mandatory laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuers is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuers, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws. 341 ----- We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exécutoire) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and the jurisdiction of the U.S. court is recognized by Luxembourg private international and local law; - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules or, at least, the court order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court); - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defense; and - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi _luxembourgeoise)._ Please note that Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may change: additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions may not be verified by Luxembourg courts in the future.

Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro.

643_3,Offerings 2019.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.4,Switzerland,23.4.1,,"We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in Switzerland or the applicability of U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court. The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceeding set forth in particular by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische Zivilprozessordnung) and the Swiss Federal Debt 342 ----- Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht), which include, amongst others: - The U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective; - The judgment being final and non-appealable under U.S. federal or state law, or no ordinary legal remedy being available against such judgment; - The defendant having had the chance to defend itself against any unduly or untimely served complaint except for a defendant that unconditionally consented to the original proceeding before the respective court; - The original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of Swiss civil procedure law, in particular the right to be heard and the possibility to properly defend the relevant case; - The matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter (Verfahren) between the same parties pending before a Swiss court, provided such Swiss matter between the same parties was pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings; and - The enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot, however, assure you that any attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings in the sense of art. 6 of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht). In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Furthermore, it is not certain that a Swiss court, if substantive proceedings were commenced in Switzerland, would apply U.S. federal or state laws. The applicable law will be determined in particular in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale _Privatrecht), which may limit the right of the parties to choose the applicable law. As an example,_ notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the parties to an agreement, a court of Switzerland or other authority will not apply a provisions of foreign law if and to the extent that this would, in the court’s or authority’s view, lead to a result violating Swiss public policy (schweizerischer ordre public) or similar general principles. Moreover, a court of Switzerland or other authority will apply, notwithstanding a valid choice of law by the parties, any provisions of Swiss law (and, subject to further conditions, of another foreign law) which in the court’s or authority’s view imperatively demand application in view of their specific purpose (lois d’application immédiate). Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. For example, with respect to the production of evidence, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under Swiss law. Instead, a Swiss court would decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties and the related burden of proof. Judicial documents may not be served directly from abroad on a person in Switzerland (see Switzerland’s reservation to the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial or Extra Judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters concluded on November 15, 1965) and service must be effective by way of judicial assistance. Furthermore, under Swiss law, any amount denominated in a foreign currency and ordered to be paid pursuant to a final judgment will be enforced by Swiss debt collection authorities and must be converted into Swiss Francs. 343 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The “centre of main interest” is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different member states may have differing and even conflicting views. Furthermore, “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation there is a rebuttable presumption that a company would have its “centre of main interests” in the member state in which it has its registered office. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another member state within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Further, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the place of the company’s central administration is located in a member state other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other member state. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the centre of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation, with these proceedings governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e. the local laws of the court opening such main insolvency proceeding. Insolvency proceedings opened in one member state under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other member states (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another member state. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the member state within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. 344 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Such proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those secondary or territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other member state. If the company does not have an establishment in any other member state, no court of any other member state has jurisdiction to open secondary or territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Such proceedings are referred to as “secondary” if they are opened after the opening of main proceedings, and “territorial” if they precede the opening of main proceedings. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the member state in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another member state where the company has an establishment and either: (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the member state in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated because of the conditions laid down by the law of the member state within the territory of which the centre of the debtor’s main interests is situated; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the member state where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective member state’s law. As with main insolvency proceedings, secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the respective territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company. The courts of all member states (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings and, subject to any exceptions provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation, that judgment will be given the same effect in the other member states so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that member state in another member state (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other member state), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other member state or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other member state where the debtor has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another member state by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the member state in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the member state where the assets are located. Such an undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court seized of a request to open secondary insolvency proceedings may, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part on receipt of a request 345 ----- from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to these certain Guarantors are likely to be initiated in Germany and, if these Guarantors were held to have their “center of main interests” within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes, as applicable, to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court _ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency_ proceedings (Antrag auf Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens). Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor and can be initiated by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). A debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation value) unless, based on the prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich). A debtor is considered to be illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts when they fall due. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the 346 ----- subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the debtor can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. In addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for such debtor of being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or any other company not having an individual as a personally liable shareholder gets into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing director(s) or under circumstances the shareholders of such company must file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay but in any event no later than three weeks after such company has become illiquid and/or over-indebted. The management of a debtor can be exposed to criminal sanctions as well as damage claims in the event that filings for insolvency are delayed or not made at all. The occurrence of illiquidity or over-indebtedness may lead to any payments, including any payments under the relevant Notes Guarantees becoming voidable. See “—Hardening Periods and _Fraudulent Transfer.”_ If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted it may also file for a preliminary protection scheme (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance of a successful restructuring. In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor must prepare an insolvency plan which will ideally be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and, upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. As part of such protective measures the court may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the_ court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. This only applies where the debtor has not (successfully) applied for so-called self-administration (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) generally will be appointed by the court if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements: - a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted); - revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the 12 months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - 50 or more employees on an annual-average basis. The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions taken during the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will, for example, have the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), orders for “self-administration”_ proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger _Sachwalter). In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an_ individual such suggestion is binding on the court unless the suggested individual is not eligible (i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met (in particular, but not limited to, evidence being provided of an existing cause of insolvency) and there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance, creditors, advance the costs themselves. In 347 ----- the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) is usually appointed by the court who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets unless debtor-in-possession (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) are only entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may deem it necessary to wind down the debtor. Satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. For the holders of the Notes, some of the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against a company subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - the right to administer and dispose of assets of the German subsidiary of the Issuers would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by management of the German subsidiary of the Issuers after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against the German subsidiary of the Issuers may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte _oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_ whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. Moreover, powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)) who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors other than creditors with preferred claims (Absonderung der Masseverbindlichkeit) is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). Unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Certain secured creditors have preferential rights regarding the enforcement of their security interests, but German insolvency law imposes certain restrictions on their ability to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings and in many cases the insolvency administrator will have the sole right to enforce the security. Whether or not a secured creditor 348 ----- remains entitled, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any moveable assets within its possession which are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte) transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). If such enforcement right is vested in the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds (plus VAT (if any)), are paid to the creditor holding the relevant security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Massekosten) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to- equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity swap with regards to the debt owed to it by the debtor if it does not consent to such swap. Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges as described above are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (as described above) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Notes. If a German subsidiary or a subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting from such collateral securing creditors other than the holders of the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the Notes under the Notes Guarantees granted by the German Guarantors after satisfaction of such secured creditors. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. It may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. An alternative distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Recently, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von _Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for_ coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a 349 ----- consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated (although the relevant court may in its discretion still appoint different administrators); (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. The German insolvency laws may be subject to further amendments in near future. On June 20, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Directive”) has been adopted. The Directive has been published on June 26, 2019 in the Official Journal of the European Union, from which date the member states will have approximately two years to implement the substantive parts of the Directive in their national legislation, although a one-year extension can be granted. The Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization).",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the security agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to such parallel debt, the security agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the relevant Indenture (the “Parallel Debt",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The Notes Guarantees and any other security granted by a GmbH in order to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to secure the liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH incorporated or established in Germany. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all. The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co, KG to be incorporated into the relevant Notes Documents (as defined in “Description of the Senior Notes” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”), in particular in the relevant Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows: (a) The Trustee and the Noteholders shall be entitled to enforce the Guarantee against the relevant German Guarantor without limitation in respect of: (i) all and any amounts which are owed under the relevant Indenture by such German Guarantor itself or by any of its Subsidiaries other than under such Guarantee (and, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, amounts owed by its general partner or any of its Subsidiaries); and (ii) all and any amounts which correspond to funds that have been borrowed under the relevant Indenture and on-lent to the relevant German Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries (or, in the 350 ----- case of a GmbH & Co. KG, to such German Guarantor, its general partner or any of its Subsidiaries) and in each case not repaid and outstanding from time to time (in aggregate, the “Unlimited Guarantee Amount”), provided that, if paragraph (a)(ii) applies, and the Issuer has a due and payable claim for repayment of such on-lent amounts, the Trustee hereby waives with binding effect on the Noteholders the restrictions set out in the relevant Clause (Deferral of _Guarantors’ rights) in respect of the German Guarantor’s recourse claim (if any) arising as a_ result of the enforcement of the Guarantee so that it shall be permitted for the German Guarantor to (1) set off its recourse claim (if any) against the loan obligation in respect of the amounts on-lent to it or (2) otherwise use its recourse claim (if any) to settle or discharge the relevant loan obligation. (b) If the German Guarantor’s liability under the Guarantee exceeds the Unlimited Guarantee Amount applicable to such German Guarantor, the Trustee and the Noteholders shall not enforce the Guarantee against such German Guarantor in excess of the Unlimited Guarantee Amount if and to the extent that: (i) the Guarantee secures the obligations of an Obligor which is a shareholder of the German Guarantor (and/or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, of its general partner) or an affiliated company (verbundenes Unternehmen) of such shareholder within the meaning of section 16, 17 or 18 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz (“AktG”)) (other than the German Guarantor and its Subsidiaries and, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, the general partner and its Subsidiaries); and (ii) the enforcement would otherwise have the effect of reducing the German Guarantor’s (or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets (Reinvermo¨gen) (the “Net Assets”) to an amount that is lower than the amount of its registered capital (Stammkapital) or, if the amount of the Net Assets is already lower than the amount of its registered capital, cause the Net Assets to be further reduced and provided that the amount of the registered capital to be taken into consideration shall be the amount registered in the commercial register at the date of the relevant Indenture, and any increase registered after the date of the relevant Indenture shall only be taken into account if such increase has been permitted under the terms of the relevant Indenture. (c) The Net Assets shall be calculated as an amount equal to the sum of the amounts of the German Guarantor’s (or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) assets (consisting of all assets which correspond to the items set forth in section 266 paragraph (2) A, B, C, D and E of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch (“HGB”)) but deducting amounts not available for distribution pursuant section 268 paragraph 8) HGB) less the aggregate amount of such German Guarantor’s (or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) liabilities (consisting of all liabilities and liability reserves (Ru¨ckstellungen) which correspond to the items set forth in section 266 paragraph (3) B, C (but disregarding, for the avoidance of doubt, any liability reserves in respect of the relevant Guarantee, any guarantee, indemnity or other obligation of such German Guarantor under or in connection with the relevant Guarantee and/or the relevant Indenture or for any other indebtedness subordinated pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), D and E HGB), save that: (i) any debt owing by the German Guarantor (and, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, any debt owing by its general partner) to any member of the Group or any other Affiliate shall not be taken into account as liability to the extent such debt would in an insolvency be subordinated by law at least to the claims of the unsubordinated creditors of such German Guarantor (or as the case may be, its general partner) (unless a waiver of such debt would result in a violation by the relevant creditor of applicable mandatory law (including section 30 GmbHG) or the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant Indenture); and (ii) obligations under loans or other contractual liabilities incurred by the German Guarantor (and, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, liabilities incurred by its general partner) in grossly negligent or wilful violation of the provisions of the relevant Indenture shall not be taken into account as liabilities. (d) The Net Assets shall be determined in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles applicable from time to time in Germany (Grundsa¨tze ordnungsma¨ßiger Buchfu¨hrung) and be based on the same principles that were applied by the German Guarantor (or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner) in the preparation of its most recent annual balance sheet (Jahresbilanz). (e) If the German Guarantor intends to demonstrate that the enforcement of the Guarantee in an amount exceeding the Unlimited Guarantee Amount would have the effect referred to in 351 ----- paragraph (b)(ii) above, then such German Guarantor (or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner) shall realize, at the request of the Trustee, at market value any of its assets that is shown in its balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value, if such asset is not necessary for its business (nicht betriebsnotwendig) and to the extent necessary to satisfy the amounts owing under the Guarantee. (f) The managing director(s) (Gescha¨ftsfu¨hrer) of the German Guarantor (or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner) shall, within 20 (twenty) Business Days after the date on which the Trustee has made a demand under the Guarantee (the “Guarantee Demand Date”), confirm to the Trustee in writing on behalf of such German Guarantor (and, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner) if and to what extent an enforcement of the Guarantee in excess of the Unlimited Guarantee Amount would have the effects referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) of this clause (the “Management Confirmation”). The Management Confirmation shall be supported by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, including interim financial statements (Stichtagsbilanz) showing the balance sheet positions mentioned in paragraph (c) of this clause (taking into account the adjustments in paragraph (c)(i) and (ii) above) as of the Guarantee Demand Date. (g) Following the Trustee’s receipt of the Management Confirmation, upon the Trustee’s request (acting reasonably) (the “Trustee’s Request”), the relevant German Guarantor will appoint, within 15 (fifteen) Business Days after the Trustee’s Request and in consultation with the Trustee, a firm of auditors of international standing and reputation (the “Auditor”) to provide to the Trustee an up-todate balance sheet together with a determination of the Net Assets no later than 60 (sixty) days following the appointment of such Auditor. Such balance sheet and determination of the Net Assets (the “Auditor’s Determination”) shall be prepared in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph (c) of this clause and shall contain further information (in reasonable detail) relating to the items to be adjusted pursuant thereto. The Auditor’s Determination pertaining to the relevant German Guarantor shall have been prepared as of the Guarantee Demand Date and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be binding on all Parties. (h) The Trustee and the Noteholders shall be entitled to demand payment under the Guarantee in an amount which would, in accordance with the Management Confirmation or, if applicable and taking into account any previous enforcement in accordance with the Management Confirmation, the Auditor’s Determination, not have the effects referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) above. (i) If and to the extent: (i) the Net Assets as determined by the Auditor’s Determination are lower than the amount enforced in accordance with the Management Confirmation; or (ii) the Guarantee has been enforced without regard to the limitations set out in paragraph (b) above because (x) the Management Confirmation was not delivered within the relevant time frame or (y) the Auditor’s Determination was not delivered within the relevant time frame but, in each case, has been delivered within 20 (twenty) Business Days following the due date for the delivery of the Auditor’s Determination, the Trustee shall without undue delay repay to the relevant German Guarantor upon written demand of the relevant German Guarantor any amount (unless already paid to the Noteholders (or any of them)), in the case of (i) above, equal to the difference between the amount paid and the amount payable resulting from the Auditor’s Determination and, in the case of (ii) above, which the Trustee would not have been entitled to enforce had the Management Confirmation and/or the Auditor’s Determination been delivered in time provided, in each case, such demand for repayment is made to the Trustee within six (6) months (Ausschlussfrist) from the date the Guarantee is enforced. The Trustee may withhold any amount received pursuant to an enforcement of the relevant Guarantee until final determination of the amount of the Net Assets pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination. (j) If, pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination, the amount of the available Net Assets is higher than that set out in the Management Confirmation, the relevant German Guarantor shall pay such amount to the Trustee within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Auditor’s Determination. (k) The limitations set out herein shall not apply to any amounts payable under the Guarantee: (i) if and for as long as a domination and/or a profit and loss transfer agreement in accordance with section 291 of the AktG between the German Guarantor (or in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner) and the Issuer or another entity guaranteeing the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture) (either directly or through a chain of domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreements) is in existence at the time of any enforcement of the Guarantee under the relevant 352 ----- Indenture and to the extent the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement results in the restrictions imposed by section 30 paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act ceasing to apply; (ii) if a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement between the German Guarantor (or in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner) and the Issuer or another entity guaranteeing the Issuer’s obligations under the relevant Indenture (either directly or indirectly through a chain of domination and or loss pooling agreements) has been terminated without the prior written consent of the Trustee (except where such termination was permitted under the relevant Indenture or is legally required in order to protect the management of the German Guarantor from personal liability or where the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement would not have resulted in the restrictions imposed by section 30 paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act ceasing to apply); (iii) if and to the extent the German Guarantor (or in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner) holds on the date of enforcement of the guarantee a fully recoverable indemnity or claim for refund (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder Ru¨ckgewa¨hranspruch) against its shareholder; or (iv) if and to the extent that such limitation is not necessary for the purpose of protecting the German Guarantor’s (or in case of a GmbH & Co. KG. its general partner’s) managing directors from the risk of personal liability pursuant to sections 43, 30 GmbHG. (l) No reduction of the amount enforceable will prejudice the right of the Trustee and the Noteholders to continue to enforce the Guarantee (subject always to the operation of the limitations set out above at the time of such enforcement) until full satisfaction of the claims guaranteed. (m) The parties to the relevant Indenture agree and are acting on the assumption (based on the commercial projection (kaufma¨nnische Prognoseentscheidung)) made by the relevant German Guarantor with the care of a prudent businessman (Sorgfalt eines ordentlichen Kaufmannes) that as at the date of such Indenture the incurrence of the Guarantee by the German Guarantor will not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfa¨higkeit) of such German Guarantor. If, however, after the date of the relevant Indenture there would be available any high court decisions (ho¨chstrichterliche Entscheidung) of a German Court of Appeals (Oberlandesgericht) or the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) holding that the granting of a guarantee and/or security to secure any obligation of an affiliated company (verbundenes Unternehmen) within the meaning of section 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz - AktG) of such guarantor and/or security grantor (other than any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) in comparable circumstances may nevertheless in case of the enforcement of such guarantee and/or security, trigger any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to section 64 sentence 3 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschra¨nkter Haftung – GmbHG) and the German Guarantor provides conclusive evidence (e.g. by a legal opinion issued by reputable legal counsel and addressed to the Finance Parties) thereof, then the enforcement of the Guarantee against the German Guarantor shall be excluded (pactum de non petendo, it being understood, however, that the claims arising under the Guarantee will in all other respect continue to exist due and payable both before and after the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the pactum de non petendo shall cease to apply if the relevant decision of a German Court of Appeals (Oberlandesgericht) is overruled by a decision of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), or the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) takes a different view than the relevant Court of Appeals (Oberlandesgericht) in another comparable case). Sub-paragraph (j) shall apply mutatis mutandis in case the Guarantee has already been enforced but the proceeds have not yet been distributed by the Trustee to the Noteholders in satisfaction of their claims under the relevant Indenture. German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. Future court rulings may further limit the access of a shareholder to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of the German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the Issuers to make payments under the Notes Guarantees, of the beneficiaries of the Notes Guarantees to enforce the Notes Guarantees or of the secured parties to enforce the collateral. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuers. In such 353 ----- case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuers to make payment on the Notes, of the subsidiaries to make payments on the Notes Guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the collateral or of the beneficiaries of the Notes Guarantees to enforce the Notes Guarantees. Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Notes Guarantees by the German Guarantors should, as of today, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German Guarantor, the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees and security interests granted by such German Guarantors may be excluded (entirely) pursuant to certain limitations contained in the relevant Indenture or relevant Security Documents, as applicable, including in case the granting or enforcement of such Notes Guarantee or security interests and/or the filing for insolvency as a consequence of a claim by any so secured finance party under such Notes Guarantee or security resulted or would result in any personal liability of the relevant German Guarantor’s managing directors pursuant to section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG and certain additional requirements set out in the Notes and the relevant Indenture are met. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted and, in addition the security granted by the debtor may become void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees by any of the German Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

On the basis of these rules, an insolvency administrator or custodian may challenge (anfechten) transactions which are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest (including guarantees). The administrator’s or custodian’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. If the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or the security were avoided, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim in insolvency proceedings in the amount of their original investment and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received by the insolvency estate or to waive such Guarantee or security interest. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases: - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time when such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggested that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that imperatively suggested such illiquidity or filing); - any act (Rechtshandlung) granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggested such detrimental effect); - a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act (Rechtshandlung) by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or a guarantee for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act (Rechtshandlung) performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted 355 ----- with the intent to prejudice its insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act. In case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and a related party of the debtor which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be avoided unless such contract was concluded more than two years prior to the filing for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors; in terms of corporate entities, the term “related party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act (Rechtshandlung) that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or a similar claim if (i) in case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and - any act (Rechtshandlung) whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to voidness rights under German insolvency law (Bargeschäftsprivileg). Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Although the security agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuers and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the security agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no separation right of the holders of the Notes with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence the secured claims (including the Parallel Debt Obligations) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain 354 ----- waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the security agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Furthermore, the initiation of restructuring proceedings is possible - in theory, irrespective of the company’s solvency situation - when at least two creditors whose total claims represent at least one-fifth of the debtor’s known debts and who are not related to the debtor file a joint application with the debtor or declare that they support the debtor’s application for company restructuring. If there are no specific legal barriers to company restructuring and, consequently, the court approves the application and initiates restructuring proceedings, the court will simultaneously appoint an administrator (Fi. selvittäjä). The administrator appointed by the court (among others) looks after the creditors’ interests in the restructuring proceedings, prepares an inventory of the company’s assets and debts and prepares a proposal for the restructuring programme. The court will often appoint a creditors committee to assist and supervise the administrator. Despite the initiation of the restructuring proceedings, the directors of the company continue to act on behalf of the company but their powers are somewhat limited. The administrator supervises the operation of the company’s business. After restructuring proceedings have been initiated, the debtor may not, without the consent of the administrator: (i) take new loans (except for such loans which are within the ordinary course of business and the amount and terms of which are not unusual); (ii) transfer the company or a part thereof or any of its assets which are required for its business purposes; (iii) grant rights to the assets covered under (ii) above (except in the ordinary course of business); (iv) transfer current assets other than in the ordinary course of business and with customary terms; (v) terminate agreements which are necessary for carrying on business; (vi) grant security for a third party’s debt (except within the ordinary course of business and provided that the risks involved are not unusual); (vii) take other actions, which are unusual or material; or (viii) petition for bankruptcy. During the restructuring proceedings, the creditors of the debtor company generally exercise their powers through the creditors committee. The creditors committee has a supervisory role and is not involved in the day-to-day management of the company. During the restructuring proceedings, the administrator has the duty to: (i) compile a list of the company’s assets, liabilities and other undertakings, as well as to draft a report of any factors likely to affect the financial status of the company; (ii) monitor the activities of the company; (iii) to the extent necessary, conduct an audit of the activities of the company prior to the commencement of the restructuring proceedings; (iv) initiate any proceedings for the reversal of transactions entered into by the debtor; (v) prepare a draft restructuring program; and (vi) manage the restructuring proceedings pursuant to the Finnish Company Restructuring Act (Fi. Laki _yrityksen saneerauksesta) (47/1993, as amended)._ The administrator has a duty to perform his functions with regard to the interests of the creditors as a whole as well as with regard to the interests of the company. The administrator has a general duty of care and shall act fairly and honorably whilst in office. All existing debts and claims against the company are suspended as of the commencement of the company restructuring. The suspension as a main rule prohibits the enforcement and placing of security, the repayment and enforcement of the restructuring debts (although debts arising after filing for company restructuring may be both repaid and enforced) and the seizure of assets. Restructuring debt, by definition, refers to all debt that has arisen prior to filing for restructuring, irrespective of when this debt falls due. The suspensions are in force until a restructuring program has been confirmed by the district court or the proceedings have been dismissed. Once the company restructuring program has been confirmed by the court, the company may pay the restructuring debts only in accordance with the program. 357 ----- All agreements entered into by the debtor remain in force and may not be terminated by a creditor, with certain exceptions. The administrator has the right to end certain agreements upon initiation of the restructuring proceedings such as lease agreements, credit-lease agreements, unfulfilled contracts not deemed to be a regular part of the activities of the debtor and employment relationships. Creditors with equal ranking have equal standing in the arrangements of the restructuring debts within the restructuring program. Subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Finnish Company Restructuring Act (Fi. Laki yrityksen saneerauksesta) (47/1993), the following measures may be taken with respect to unsecured debts in the restructuring program: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be considered as payments against principal first, and as payments of interest and other credit costs only second; (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of a debt; and (iv) reduce the outstanding principal balance of unpaid debt. The restructuring program may also include the full or partial refinancing of debt. Consequently, the restructuring procedure could result in holders of the Senior Secured Notes and/or Senior Notes receiving a right to recover considerably less than they would otherwise be entitled to recover under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee. It is to be noted, however, that the restructuring may not lead to a worse outcome for the creditors than the bankruptcy of the debtor. Secured debt means restructuring debt where the creditor holds an effective (against third parties) security interest to property that belongs to or is in the possession of the debtor, insofar as the value of the security at the commencement of the proceedings would have been enough to cover the amount of the creditor’s claim after the deduction of liquidation costs and claims with a higher priority, i.e., the amount of the creditor’s claim exceeding the value of the security does not qualify as secured debt but, instead, will constitute unsecured debt and may, thus be subject to the measures described above. Regarding floating charges (Fi. yrityskiinnitys), only 50% of the value of the charged assets will be considered as secured debt. The administrator determines the value of the security. The part of the debt for which the value of the security is insufficient is considered unsecured debt, and may thus be restructured as unsecured debt (e.g. haircut). Should the security be deemed worthless or the standing of the creditor sufficiently junior in relation to other creditors with the same security, the debt may be even considered unsecured in its entirety. The following debt arrangements may be applied to secured debt: (i) change the repayment schedule; (ii) order that debt payments be applied as payments against principal first and as payments of interest and other credit costs second; or (iii) reduce the obligation to pay interest and other credit costs with respect to the remaining term of the debt. Even if the debt arrangement does not affect the existence or content of a creditor’s security interest, the security arrangements relating to the debt may be altered by replacing the security with other fully adequate security. Payments on a secured debt shall be determined so that at least the present value of the secured debt will be repaid within a reasonable period, not to materially exceed the remainder of the credit period without the consent of the creditor or, if the debt has become due in full, not to materially exceed one-half of the original credit period. As for reducing interest and other credit costs, a court will take into consideration the length of the remaining credit period, so that the longer the remaining credit period, the smaller the reduction in interest and credit costs. Restructuring of both unsecured and secured debt may take place only to the extent deemed necessary for the success of the restructuring proceedings. Bondholders are primarily each regarded as individual creditors to the debtor. The bondholders may, however, appoint a trustee to represent the bondholder collectively in relation to the debtor and the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

If the application is approved, an estate administrator (Fi. pesänhoitaja) (or several estate administrators) of the bankruptcy estate will be appointed by the court. Bankruptcy covers all liabilities of the debtor, and its objective is to liquidate the assets of the debtor and use the proceeds received therefrom in payment of the creditors’ claims. In order to achieve the objective of bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are, from the beginning of the bankruptcy, subject to the authority of the estate administrator. The estate administrator must act for the common benefit of all creditors and shall comply with the decisions and guidelines of the creditors in matters falling within the decision-making powers of the creditors. The creditors are represented through the creditor’s meeting, and a creditors’ committee may be appointed by the court. The bankruptcy estate may (exceptionally) continue with the company’s business operations, and the disposal of property will be realized as soon as reasonably possible. 358 ----- As a main rule, in order to be entitled to a disbursement, a creditor must lodge a claim in bankruptcy in writing (a “letter of lodgement”), by delivering it to the estate administrator no later than the deadline set by the estate administrator. The obligation to lodge a claim binds even secured creditors. Failure to lodge a claim may lead to the expiration of the debt. A creditor who holds assets belonging to the debtor as security for the debt of a third party must, at the request of and within a time limit set by the estate administrator, provide the information on receivables and collateral that should be provided in a letter of lodgement. A creditor who holds a floating charge over the assets of the debtor as security of a claim against the debtor in bankruptcy or a debt owed by some other debtor shall lodge the claim as provided in the Finnish Bankruptcy Act (Fi. Konkurssilaki) (120/2004, as amended). If a claim is denominated in a currency other than euro, a value in euro for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings is determined using the exchange rate at the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. A creditor who wishes to use his or her claim for set-off against a debt owed to the debtor must, when giving notice of the set-off, provide the estate administrator with the same information that would be provided in a letter of lodgement. Similar creditors have an equal right to payment from the funds of the bankruptcy estate in the proportion to the amount of their claims, unless otherwise provided by law. The Act on the Ranking of Claims (Fi. _Laki velkojien maksunsaantijärjestyksestä) (1578/1992, as amended) determines the order in which debts_ are settled. The following creditors have precedence over unsecured creditors to receive disbursement from the estate: (i) secured creditors and holders of retention rights have priority to the proceeds relating to the relevant asset; (ii) creditors of the administrative expenses of the bankruptcy estate, creditors with claims on the basis of contracts that the bankruptcy estate (rather than the debtor) has entered into, any liabilities for which the bankruptcy estate is responsible by operation of law and creditors of a debt that has arisen between the commencement and discontinuation of restructuring proceeding; and (iii) creditors with claims that are secured by a floating charge will receive prior to other claims a disbursement of 50% of the net proceeds of the charged assets (after the claims of creditors with a better priority position have been satisfied). The rights of the above-mentioned preferential creditors may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and/or Senior Notes. Bankruptcy of a Finnish Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and/or Finnish Senior Notes Guarantor could result in holders of the Senior Secured Notes and/or Senior Notes recovering considerably less than they would have otherwise been entitled to recover under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee. Further, it should be noted that debt incurred after the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, such as debt the estate has committed to, is prioritized and effectively reduce disbursable funds, and security with higher priority naturally affects the value of the security of the secured creditor with a lower priority. The Finnish Act on the Ranking of Claims specifies which debt is ranked with the lowest priority. Such debt may be, for example, any interest accrued after the commencement of the bankruptcy, capital loans, or bonds issued with a lower priority in relation to other indebtedness by the debtor. In practice, there rarely remain disbursable funds to even partially cover claims with the lowest priority. The Finnish state has no preferential rights regarding taxes and other fiscal charges. The assets of the bankruptcy estate are to be disposed of in the most advantageous manner so as to maximize the aggregate net proceeds. However, secured creditors that are secured pursuant to a fixed charge over movable or immovable property may exercise their right to enforce such collateral regardless of the bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy estate may at its own discretion prohibit the sale for a maximum of two months. The bankruptcy estate may sell collateral belonging to the estate only if the creditor protected by the collateral consents to the same or if the court grants a specific permission. _Effect of bankruptcy on the bankruptcy debtor’s contracts_ As such, the debtor’s contracts are not automatically terminated upon the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Contract clauses by which contracts are immediately terminated upon bankruptcy are generally considered null and void, and are thus unenforceable. Pursuant to the Finnish Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy estate is generally entitled to become party to any contracts of the debtor by notifying the creditor of this within a reasonable time. As noted above, debt arisen from such a contract entered into by the bankruptcy estate is prioritized over bankruptcy debts. If a bankruptcy estate is willing to become party to a contract, the law entitles a creditor to request acceptable collateral from the bankruptcy estate to secure the performance of the contract. Should the bankruptcy estate be unwilling or unable to provide such collateral to the creditor, the creditor is entitled to terminate the contract. 359 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Laki takaisinsaannista _konkurssipesään) (758/1991, as amended) (the “Recovery Act”), certain acts performed by a debtor may be_ reversed if the rights of creditors have been prejudiced by those acts. According to the Finnish Company Restructuring Act and the Finnish Enforcement Code (Fi. Ulosottokaari) (705/2007, as amended), the grounds for recovery set forth in the Recovery Act are also to be applied in restructuring and enforcement proceedings. The bankruptcy estate administrator, the restructuring administrator and certain creditors may seek to recover assets of the debtor in connection with bankruptcy, restructuring or enforcement proceedings. The administrator or the creditors may, within a specified time, either file an action for recovery against the debtor’s counterparty in a separate court proceeding or file an objection. Certain general rules for recovery apply to all transactions between an insolvent debtor (including a debtor who becomes insolvent partially due to the transaction) and the counterparty of the debtor. A transaction concluded within five years prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or enforcement is filed with the court or relevant authority (as well as transactions performed after such date) may be recovered if: (i) the transaction, either by itself or together with other transactions, improperly (a) favors a creditor at the expense of other creditors, (b) places property beyond the reach of other creditors, or (c) increases debts to the detriment of the creditors; (ii) the debtor, at the time of the transaction, was, or partly due to the transaction became, insolvent or, in case of a transaction considered to be a gift or a contract with the characteristics of a gift, over-indebted; (iii) the counterparty of the transaction knew or should have known of the insolvency or over-indebtedness, or of the relevance of the transaction to the debtor’s economic situation; and (iv) the counterparty knew or should have known the facts mentioned above in paragraph (i), on the basis of which the transaction is considered improper. The grounds for recovery under Section 5 of the Recovery Act, which covers all transactions concluded between the debtor and a counterparty, are thus applicable only if the counterparty had qualified or should have had qualified knowledge of all the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Transactions between the debtor and certain (natural or legal) persons within the debtor’s sphere of interest (as defined in the Recovery Act) may be recovered regardless of the date of the transaction and such persons are assumed to have had knowledge of the issues described above in (i) and (ii). Pursuant to the Recovery Act, certain transactions can, in certain circumstances, be recovered regardless of the good faith of the counterparty and regardless of the solvency of the debtor at the time of the transaction. Such transactions include, among other things: (i) payments received through foreclosure; (ii) the payment of debts; and (iii) the granting of security. Payment received by a creditor through foreclosure effected by the relevant authority later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, company restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years) may be recovered. Any debt paid later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years (in case of recovery with respect to payment of debt between closely related parties made later than two years, but before three months from when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority, the recovery may be rejected if it is shown that debtor was not insolvent nor became insolvent due to the payment)) may be recovered if: (i) unusual means of payment have been used; (ii) the payment was premature; or (iii) the amount of payment was considerable in comparison to the assets of the debtor. However, a payment may not be recovered if it, when all circumstances are taken into consideration, may be held as customary. Security given later than three months prior to the date when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or the relevant authority (or, in the event that the beneficiary is a person within the debtor’s sphere of interest, within two years (in case of recovery with respect to granting security between closely related parties made later than two years, but before three months from when the petition for bankruptcy, restructuring or foreclosure is filed with the court or relevant authority, the recovery may be rejected if it is shown that debtor was not insolvent nor became insolvent due to the granting of security)) may be recovered if: (i) the parties had not agreed upon the security in connection with the granting of the credit; or (ii) the possession of the security had not been transferred, or any similar act perfecting the security had not been taken without unjustified delay after the granting of the credit. When a transaction is recovered, the property that has been received from the debtor is returned to the bankruptcy estate or the debtor. The bankruptcy estate or the debtor also returns the compensation that has been paid for the property. If the funds have been placed beyond the reach of the creditors and the 360 ----- party that paid the funds knew or should have known that this was the intention of the debtor, there is no obligation for the estate to return the funds. If the property to be returned no longer exists, or is otherwise not returnable, compensation for the value of the property must be made. In addition, should the return of certain property cause inconvenience to the party under such obligation, a court may entitle such party to pay compensation equal to the value of the property instead of returning the property. The Recovery Act also sets forth an obligation to compensate for any decrease in value of the recovered property. Accordingly, the validity of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee or any payment made thereunder may be challenged under the Recovery Act and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. If the granting of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee or a payment thereunder is successfully challenged under the Recovery Act, then the granting of such a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee could be nullified or the payment recovered.

Osakeyhtiölaki) (624/2006, as amended). Pursuant to such limitation, the beneficiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee agree to enforce the guarantee against any Finnish Guarantor only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in a breach of the mandatory regulation of the Finnish Companies Act by that Finnish Guarantor. Certain significant limitations to a company’s ability to grant guarantees are included in Sections 1 and 10 of Chapter 13 of the Finnish Companies Act regulating corporate benefit, unlawful distribution of funds and prohibited financial assistance. Pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act, a Finnish limited liability company, such as the Finnish Guarantor, is prohibited from providing loans, guarantees, assets or security for the purpose of a third party acquiring shares in such company or its parent companies. Further, the Finnish Companies Act provides that no guarantee or security may be granted (or any other transaction entered into) by a Finnish limited liability company without commercial grounds, i.e., unless doing so is in the company’s own commercial interest. In assessing the existence and scope of corporate benefit to the company, all relevant benefits and risks to the company are to be taken into account. In the context of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee, among other things, other guarantees and security granted or to be granted by the Finnish Guarantor for the other financing arrangements of the Group in connection with, inter alia, the New Revolving Credit Facility, are to be taken into consideration. The actual scope of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee by a Finnish Guarantor may therefore be substantially less than the aggregate amount of liabilities expressed to be guaranteed and, in fact, it is possible that owing to the application of mandatory Finnish law relating to corporate benefit, unlawful distribution of assets and/or financial assistance, as applied to the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Notes Guarantee, no liabilities or obligations will under Finnish law, be held to be effectively guaranteed.

The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type. Under Finnish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest (pledge) by the secured party and the grantor (pledgor), for any security (pledge) to be validly created, the grantor (pledgor) must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest (pledge). Any security interest (pledge) purported to be created under Finnish law over assets which the grantor (pledgor) may remain in possession of, retain exclusive or shared control over, entitled to operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interest (pledge) has been perfected. Such unperfected security interest (pledge) is vulnerable of being set aside in any insolvency proceedings affecting the grantor (pledgor) and may, potentially, be declared void. _Shares_ In the case of shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved in respect of a private limited liability company by (i) transferring the share certificate(s) (if issued) to the possession of the secured party and/or (ii) notifying the company of the pledge. _Claims in General_ Pledges can also be granted and perfected in receivables and other claims (including dividends). Security over receivables and claims (other than claims represented by negotiable instruments) is perfected by way of notification to the debtor of the underlying claim. There is no requirement as to the form for such notification. However, in order to obtain the intended result, the pledgor or the secured party should state that the claim has been pledged to the secured party and the notice must also effectively prohibit the underlying debtor from paying the pledgor. This means that the underlying debtor must be instructed to make payments to the pledgee (instead of the pledgor). Any claims/receivables pledged as Collateral to secure the Senior Secured Notes will not be perfected on the Issue Date, and will not be perfected until an enforcement event. In respect of negotiable promissory notes, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the promissory notes into the possession of the secured party. _Floating Charges and Real Estate Mortgages_ In the case of Finnish floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the duly issued and registered Finnish floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates into the possession of the secured party. The capital amounts of floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates do not necessarily correlate with the value of the assets covered by the relevant floating charges and real estate mortgages, and are often materially higher than the actual value of such assets. Therefore, the capital amount of floating charge promissory notes and real estate mortgage certificates cannot be used as an indication of potential recovery in an enforcement scenario. In Finland, new mortgages have been issued only in electronic form starting from 1 June 2017. Issued physical mortgage certificates may remain in use without conversion to electronic format for an unlimited period of time but with limitations after a transition period. Any security rights established by means of physical mortgage certificates before 31 December 2019 will remain in force until they expire in the conventional manner, for instance due to the repayment of debt. However, physical mortgage certificates may not be used to establish new security rights after 1 January 2020. Consequently, it is advisable for creditors to change physical mortgage certificates into electronic ones prior to the beginning of 2020 at least if further secured claims e.g. in form of further advances are to be established after 31 December 2019.

Instead, in company restructuring proceedings, a moratorium applies and enforcement is generally not possible. The terms of the relevant security agreement regulate the enforcement, however, subject to constraints set by mandatory Finnish law. Complex, case specific legal issues often apply to enforcement. These aspects are discussed below on a general level only. _Enforcement outside of Bankruptcy Proceedings_ Depending on the type of security arrangement/asset under security, the secured creditor may, generally, enforce the security independently (such as security over shares and receivables) or through public enforcement authorities (such as floating charges and real estate mortgages). When enforcing a security, the secured creditor has a duty to take into account, in an appropriate way in the circumstances, the interests of the pledgor and those of other potential interested parties, such as any second lien pledgees or floating charge holders. In practice, this means, inter alia, that the secured creditor may not sell the secured assets for a price lower than fair market value in the then current circumstances. This duty of care is generally deemed to apply irrespective of the terms of the security agreement. When the secured creditor enforces security outside of bankruptcy proceedings and to the extent that the net proceeds exceed the creditor’s secured claim, the secured creditor must hold the excess proceeds for the account of any second lien pledgees, floating charge holders and/or the pledgor, as appropriate. _Enforcement during Bankruptcy Proceedings_ In a bankruptcy scenario where the secured creditor enforces the security independent from the concurrent bankruptcy proceedings (which is possible in respect of e.g. security over shares and receivables, but not for floating charges), the secured creditor will use the enforcement proceeds to satisfy its secured claim. The secured creditor shall then render to the bankruptcy administrator an account of the proceeds of the enforcement and transfer to the bankruptcy administrator the net proceeds from the enforcement that exceed the creditor’s secured claim. After bankruptcy proceedings have been initiated, there are four options available for the enforcement of a real estate mortgage: (i) Private (or public) sale by the administrator with the consent of the mortgagee(s). (ii) If the mortgagee(s) does not give its consent for the administrator to effect a private (or public) sale, the administrator may seek the court’s approval for the sale. (iii) Despite the bankruptcy proceedings, the mortgagee can proceed to seek a court order to allow the mortgagee to independently enforce the mortgage by arranging the sale of the underlying real property through public enforcement authorities (however, the administrator may impose an interim moratorium up to two months’ time period). (iv) After three years have passed since the commencement of the bankruptcy, public sale by the administrator without the consent of the mortgagee(s) or a court order. In a bankruptcy scenario where the bankruptcy administrator enforces the security, the bankruptcy administrator will distribute the enforcement proceeds to the secured creditor up to the amount of the creditor’s secured claim, whereas any excess proceeds will form a part of the assets of the estate (to be distributed to creditors). Irrespective of whether the enforcement in bankruptcy was carried out by the secured creditor independently or by the bankruptcy administrator, should the enforcement proceeds not suffice to satisfy the creditor’s secured claim, the outstanding balance of the secured creditor’s claim will constitute an ordinary unsecured claim towards the bankruptcy estate and will rank pro rata with the claims of other unsecured creditors. 363 ----- _Enforcement during Company Restructuring Proceedings_ If company restructuring proceedings have been initiated against the pledgor, the pledgee can no longer enforce the pledge independently (nor accelerate the underlying loans against the pledgor) and any enforcement procedures already initiated (but not completed) will be discontinued. The prohibition to enforce the pledge is in force until the court has passed a decision to either accept or reject the restructuring program proposed by the administrator. This moratorium does not, however, apply where the security in question qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Finnish Act on Financial Collateral (Fi. Rahoitusvakuuslaki) (11/2004, as amended) or where the security is situated within the territory of another Member State as provided for in Article 5(1) of the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings. If the restructuring program is accepted by the court, the enforcement of pledges is likely to be covered by the restructuring program. Should the proposed program be rejected, the most likely outcome is the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. _Security Granted in Favor of an Agent_ There is some uncertainty under Finnish law as to whether security can validly be granted in favor of an agent or trustee alone and not in favor of the relevant pledgees/secured parties. However, the Finnish Act on Bondholder Representatives (Fi. Laki joukkolainanhaltijoiden edustajasta) (574/2017, as amended) recognizes the concept of security agency as part of Finnish law. The pledgees/secured parties may be represented by an agent who can enter into the relevant security agreement for and on behalf of the pledgees/secured parties based on a power of attorney or a mandate of agency. It is generally considered under Finnish law that an irrevocable authorization and an irrevocable appointment of agent may nevertheless be revoked at any time by the principal. To address the aforesaid uncertainty about the enforceability of a pledge granted solely in favor of an agent or a trustee, the Finnish Security Agreements have been executed by the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. _Liquidation due to capital deficiency_ The Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act (Fi.

The Notes will be issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer and guaranteed, as applicable, by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and CABB Nordic Holding S.à r.l., which are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, or the “Luxembourg Guarantor/Issuer.” Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuers, as entities having their registered office and central administration (administration centrale) and centre of main interests (“COMI”), as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI in the jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered if the registered office has not moved to another member state within 3 months prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. As a result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the COMI of each Issuer is in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and consequently that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law. However, the determination of where the Issuers have their COMI is a question of fact, which may change from time to time. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is ascertainable by third parties. 364 ----- In that respect, the courts have to take a number of factors into consideration, such as the place where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. The point at which a company’s COMI is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be initiated against a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its center of main interests (within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation) or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre of main interests is located in a jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable): - bankruptcy proceedings (“faillite”), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (“cessation des paiements”) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (“ébranlement de crédit”). The main effect of such proceedings is the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third parties on the basis of principles of managers’/ directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute _simple) in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code;_ - controlled management proceedings (“gestion contrôlée”), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors (please see below for the applicable provision of the “Financial Collateral Law 2005); - composition proceedings (“concordat préventif de la faillite”), the opening of which may only be requested by the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except for secured creditors (please see the below applicable provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005); or - in addition to these proceedings, the ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (“sursis de paiement”) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (“liquidation judiciaire”). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg law of August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Companies Law 1915”). The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of a Luxembourg guarantor in respect of the relevant Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum social salary); - employees’ contributions to social security; - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - employer’s contribution to social security; - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; and - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise. 365 ----- Assets over which a security interest has been granted will, in principle, not be available for distribution to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). Favorable rules apply in relation to security interests of claims or financial instruments securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments) pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Article 20 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that Luxembourg law financial collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties, are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the pre-bankruptcy preference period (période suspecte) against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud). Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Law 2005. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg preference period rules are disapplied (save the case of fraud). Article 21(2) of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar persons if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of such proceedings, measures or arrangement. _Impact of insolvency proceedings on transactions_ During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Issuer’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings a notice of default may still be served. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuers during the preference period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months plus ten days preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de Commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. 366 ----- In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg guarantor’s business and assets and such Luxembourg guarantor’s respective obligations under the Notes. Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice, however, to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 as described above and article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The granting of any financial collateral governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005 must be capable of being evidenced in writing. However, additional steps are required to enforce security interests against third parties. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts will generally apply, in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over the assets subject to such security interests, the law of the place where such assets subject are situated (lex rei sitae or _lex situs). As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and_ enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/ claims having debtors located in Luxembourg and/or governed by Luxembourg law, securities which are held through an account located (or deemed to be located) in Luxembourg and bearer securities physically held in Luxembourg. If certain assets are located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The creation, validity and enforcement of security interests such as pledges and transfer of ownership as security, granted on financial instruments and claims (in order to secure cash settlement and/or delivery of financial instruments) are notably governed by the Financial Collateral Law 2005. Pursuant to the Financial Collateral Law 2005, a pledge (gage) is effected by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets. As the physical transfer of possession is not possible for intangibles such as monetary claims, the Financial Collateral Law 2005 provides for a fictitious transfer of possession (i.e., perfection) which is effected by mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the dispossession is validly realized by notifying the pledge to the issuer of such shares or by an acceptance of the pledge by the issuer of such shares who in turn will proceed to an entry of the pledge in the share register held by the issuer of such shares. A pledge granted over intercompany receivables is perfected once the relevant pledge agreement has been entered into by all parties thereto. However, in order for the debtor under the pledged receivables not to be able to validly liberate itself from its payment obligations thereunder by paying the pledgor instead of the Security Agent, when the pledge agreement provides that such payment shall inure to the Security Agent, the debtor of such receivables needs to be notified of or has to accept the pledge granted thereover. The above perfection steps and actions need to be undertaken by the grantor of the security interest and/or the Security Agent. If the relevant pledgor or the Security Agent fails or is unable to take the necessary steps/actions required to take or perfect any of the above-mentioned security interests, such security interests will not have been created and/or perfected with respect to the claims arising under the Notes. Article 11 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 sets out the following enforcement methods, available upon the occurrence of the relevant enforcement event in respect of a pledge governed by the provisions of the Financial Collateral Law 2005: - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price 367 ----- of the pledged assets (if the pledged assets are listed on an official Luxembourg or foreign stock market or traded on a recognized regulated market open to the public); - selling or causing the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially reasonable terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange, or (iii) by way of a public auction; - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Financial Collateral Law 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Luxembourg law governed security interests may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located outside of Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, unless “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled in priority to the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees and/or security interests, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the decision be approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been appointed for such purpose. In addition, the granting of the envisaged guarantees and/or security interests must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object. The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company”, which is a translation of the French “intérêt social”, an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit. The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior”. Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit is subjective. In a group context, the interest of the companies of the group taken individually is not entirely eliminated. With respect to guarantors and/or security grantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Companies Law 1915, does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee and/or secure the indebtedness of another entity of the same group, it is generally held that within a group of companies, in the context of a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in granting upstream or cross-stream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee or security) to other group companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee or security, provided that the following conditions are met (and subject in any event to all the factual circumstances of the matter): (i) such guarantee or security must be given for the purpose of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group, (ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee or security must not be without consideration and such commitment must not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group companies, and (iii) such guarantee or security granted or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the committing company. Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee or a security interest on a group level is certainly important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a 368 ----- lack of corporate interest for one or more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate benefit is of particular importance in the context of misuse of corporate assets provided by Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915. The failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (personal and/or criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Company Law 1915, a director or a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets only if someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, _e.g., a creditor, a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be_ excluded that the public prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Companies Law 1915 will be held null and void. The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment is required to be made by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company. As a result of the above developments, the guarantees or security interests granted by a Luxembourg company will be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres) and certain intra-group liabilities), which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indentures or guarantee agreements. The registration of the Notes, the security interest agreements, the Indentures, the Notes Guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) with the Administration de _l’Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA in Luxembourg may be required in the case that the Notes, the_ security interest agreements, the Indentures, the Notes Guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) are either (i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang _des minutes d’un notaire) or (iii) registered on a voluntary basis. In such case, either a nominal registration_ duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will be payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered.

The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, but parties may object to any creditor request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court could deny such a request.

Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,562.11.2,Right of debtor-in-possession to remain in control of collateral and the bankruptcy process,"An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its property and is authorized to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession”, subject to certain limitations. This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a liquidation case under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to the circumstances. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate protection for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures. Likewise, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code generally does not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees with respect to unsecured or undersecured claims. Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a plan of reorganization unless the debtor fails to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan within the first 180 days of the case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other parties such as secured creditors would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans. In consideration of the automatic stay, the lack of precise definition of the term “adequate protection”, the exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of the bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when a holder of the Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes could enforce its rights; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed or confirmed; or - whether or to what extent holders of the Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of any collateral through the provision of “adequate protection.”",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the adjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type with other claims or interests that are substantially similar. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan, but still entitled to some distribution under the plan, may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interests that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if more than one-half in number of claims holders and two-thirds in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, it may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so long as the plan (i) does not discriminate unfairly and (ii) is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending on the law applied in any proceeding with respect to an alleged fraudulent transfer or conveyance. Generally, a U.S. Obligor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than all of its assets, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. There can be, however, no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency determinations and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. If a court were to find that the issuance of a guarantee or security interest was a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the guarantee or security interest, subordinate the payment obligations under such guarantee or security agreement to the existing and future indebtedness of the Obligor or require the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, as applicable, to repay any 372 ----- amounts received with respect to the guarantee or security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance occurred, there may be no payment made in respect of the affected guarantees. In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a U.S. bankruptcy case with respect to fraudulent transfers and fraudulent conveyances, claims in respect of liens or obligations evidenced by guarantees may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests, the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company or which is entered into within a certain period prior to insolvency or bankruptcy, may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the trustee or insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of a Guarantor may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that the applicable court may determine the guarantee should be limited or voided.

Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,562.11.8,,"vary and provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy, subject to the rights of creditors and other parties in interest to object and seek relief from the bankruptcy court. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to: - the administration of a bankruptcy case, including (i) the imposition of the automatic stay, which immediately stays all litigation, as well as most enforcement and other actions against the debtors or property of the bankruptcy estate; (ii) provision of “adequate protection” to secured creditors to protect against diminution of value of their collateral; (iii) terms for the use, sale or lease of property; (iv) standards for obtaining post-petition credit; and (v) rules regarding the treatment of executory contracts and unexpired leases; - creditors and claims, including deadlines and requirements for filing proofs of claim, the priority and allowance of claims, and subordination of claims; and - creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and ability to bring turnover and avoidance actions, provisions relating to liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the filing of ancillary and other cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor’s assets by a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court and typically results in the immediate shutdown of the debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to continue to operate their business as a going concern while they reorganize their businesses and resolve their obligations to creditors (although a liquidation or sale under chapter 11 is also possible), in each case pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation, as applicable. Unlike in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case the debtor typically remains in possession of its assets and continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case (subject to the supervision of the bankruptcy court), with substantially the rights that a trustee would otherwise have. In addition, “liquidating” chapter 11 cases may be used as an alternative to a liquidation under chapter 7, particularly in an instance when the debtor seeks to maintain the “going-concern value” of its business and/or expects to sell all or substantially all of its assets free and clear of liens during the course of the bankruptcy case. Because bankruptcy proceedings are often fact specific and vary case-by-case, and because bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that could affect the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes, and/or the guarantees and security is not contained herein. Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction. 370 ----- With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (e.g., assignments for the benefit of creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms), the effect on creditors in these proceedings are fact-specific, vary from state-to-state, and require an examination of both statutory and common law, the details of which also are not described herein.

In addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests over assets located in Switzerland. The insolvency laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA, Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. Under these rules, claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of a bankruptcy proceeding (Konkursverfahren) and, hence, a general liquidation of all assets and liabilities of a Swiss debtor. If bankruptcy has not been declared, creditors secured by a pledge must follow a special enforcement proceeding limited to the liquidation of the collateral (Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) unless the parties have agreed that general debt enforcement proceedings and/or a private liquidation are permissible. However, if bankruptcy is declared while such a 375 ----- special enforcement proceeding is pending, the proceeding ceases and the creditor participates in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is no longer permitted. The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in force. Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from a Swiss insolvency law point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Under Swiss insolvency laws, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex _officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency_ proceedings. Insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate law in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency laws in the event that the debtor has obviously and permanently stopped to pay its debts as and when they fall due or has acted fraudulently, or is attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also initiate insolvency proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally, pursuant to Swiss corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be assessed pursuant to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations and on the basis of a balance sheet to be drawn up (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s assets and (ii)—to the extent there is still a going concern scenario—based upon the going concern value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued at liquidation values nor at going concern values, the debtor’s board of directors has to notify the bankruptcy court, provided that creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the over-indebtedness (Art. 725 Swiss Code of Obligations). However, as soon as the debtor loses the going concern assumption for accounting purposes, going concern values become irrelevant and over-indebtedness is assessed solely based on liquidation values. While the criterion of over-indebtedness is based on a balance sheet test (rather than a liquidity test), it is important to note that a debtor’s inability to pay its debts as and when they fall due will cause the debtor to lose the going concern assumption for accounting purposes and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation values. This, in turn, will typically result in over-indebtedness. The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to file for bankruptcy without delay and non-compliance with this obligation exposes the board of directors to both damage claims and (in extraordinary cases) sanctions under criminal law. The debtor’s board of directors need not file for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in an aggregate amount no lower than the amount of the debtor’s over indebtedness subordinate their claims against the claims of all other creditors, or (ii) if there is a substantiated likelihood for an informal (i.e., out of court) workout within a relatively short period of time. It is not settled in Swiss case law as to how long such period of time is supposed to be. However, many legal scholars consider such period to be four to six weeks. Finally, the debtor’s auditors have the obligation to notify the competent court if the debtor’s board of directors has failed to file for insolvency despite the debtor being obviously over indebted. If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings it has to file an application for commencement of enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office (Betreibungsamt). With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located where the debtor is registered or resident. The debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No reasons need to be given for the objection. The debt collection office notifies the creditor of the objection. For claims based on an enforceable judgment, the creditor can without any further delay file an application to lift this stay with the court (Rechtsöffnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an enforceable judgment, but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional lifting of such stay can be applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung). In the event the objection is set aside in these summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an action in ordinary court proceedings for a negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist (Aberkennungsklage). The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to continue the enforcement proceeding (Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent debt collection office delivers a continuation threat of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung) to the debtor. The insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the creditor’s rights. After 20 days from receipt of the threat 376 ----- of bankruptcy (Konkursandrohung) the creditor may petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. The competent insolvency court decides upon the insolvency without any delay, provided that there are no reasons which would lead to a suspension of the insolvency court’s decision. In addition, the debtor has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the insolvency court. The insolvency court orders the continuation of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order to continue insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the insolvency proceedings themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the insolvency proceedings will be closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the insolvency office may request the insolvency court to resolve upon summary insolvency proceedings (summarisches _Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary insolvency proceedings and_ the actual facts of the case are not complicated. Furthermore, in such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary insolvency proceedings. Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) provided that certain acts require the approval of the insolvency court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). The creditors’ committee has additional competences. Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not interest bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of insolvency, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon insolvency, interest ceases to accrue. Only secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such interests. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings in Switzerland. Swiss insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with, and subject to, the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such security is vested with the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, such as a debtor’s employees. Certain privileges can further result for the Swiss government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) after the security interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in full. As an alternative solution to insolvency, the debtor (or, under certain circumstances, a creditor) may seek a composition with creditors (Nachlassverfahren) by applying to the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht) for a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) and submitting, besides other documents, a tentative reorganization plan. The court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium provisionally (provisorische Stundung) for a maximum period of up to four months or not. With its decision the court appoints a commissioner provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). In case circumstances would 377 ----- justify it, the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht) may withhold a public announcement of the granting of the provisional moratorium, provided third party interests are well protected. In such case, (i) the creditors and other authorities will not be notified, (ii) debt collection proceedings may still be initiated or further pursued (unless challenged by the debtor) and (iii) a provisional commissioner (provisorischer Sachwalter) must be appointed in all circumstances. In case it is obvious that there are no chances for a successful reorganization of the company or a composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag), the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht), acting on its own motion, opens insolvency proceedings over the debtor. In case the moratorium has been granted provisionally (provisorische Stundung) and in case during the period of the provisional moratorium a reorganization of the company or a composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a time before the provisional moratorium has expired, the court approves the moratorium definitely (definitive Stundung) and appoints a commissioner (Sachwalter). The court may, where deemed necessary, also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss) for the purpose of supervising the commissioner. The commissioner convokes a meeting of creditors (Gläubigerversammlung) which has to approve the draft composition agreement according to specific majority rules. The composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is subject to the approval of the composition court. The Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) provides for three different types of composition agreements: the ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag), the composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit _Vermögensabtretung) and the composition agreement in insolvency proceedings (Nachlassvertrag im Konkurs). During a definitive moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending_ proceedings are stayed. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. In case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the settlement only for the amount of its claim not covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). However, a debtor may, subject to consent by the commissioner (Sachwalter), terminate long-term agreements (Dauerschuldverhältnisse) (other than employment agreements) without notice (even if notice periods apply under the agreement as such), provided (i) the continuation of the long-term agreement (Dauerschuldverhältnis) would impede or at least seriously challenge the intended financial recovery and (ii) provided the counterparty to such long-term agreement (Dauerschuldverhältnis) is held harmless (it being understood that the respective claim would be a claim in the composition proceeding (Nachlassforderung)). Interest payments will be stopped for unsecured claims during the moratorium (unless otherwise explicitly provided in the composition agreement). The moratorium aims at facilitating a rehabilitation of the debtor under protection of the court or the conclusion of one of the above composition agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors, whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be insufficient to cover the secured claims. Privileged claims must be paid in full.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of art. 111 Swiss Code of Obligations are typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative. Other security (rights in rem) is enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security agreement. Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties to enforce the security either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA), in which case the right of objection pursuant to Art. 41 DEBA (Einrede der Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security agreements. In such case, the parties also typically agree in advance that a private sale (Freihandverkauf) will be admissible. In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may acquire any or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In case of an assignment of claims for security purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured parties, collect all assigned claims. Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties by way of a private sale (Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case without having to initiate proceedings under the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA). 378 ----- After an insolvency has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar security rights are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Under Swiss law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes will not be party to the security documents relating to the collateral. In order for the holders of the Notes to benefit from “accessory” security interests and have a secured claim, the security documents and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by Swiss law will directly secure the parallel debt. However, the parallel debt concept has not been tested in court under Swiss law, and there is no certainty that it will be recognized and held valid and enforceable under Swiss law.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

In particular, a transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) that is detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors: - The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the transaction, who must in this case prove that such transaction was at arm’s length. - Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security for already existing claims, provided that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any way other than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is excluded if the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the debtor had been over-indebted at that time. - Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) performed by the debtor with the intention to disadvantage its creditors, or discriminate some creditors against others or to favor some creditors to others are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence must have been known, to the debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including, without limitation, a group company, the burden of proof is shifted to the beneficiary of the transaction, who must in this case prove that such intention was not recognizable. If any guarantee or security is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee and/or any security interest and would have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been avoided would have to be repaid. 379 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Therefore, the Indentures and/or any other relevant document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will contain certain limitation language in relation to Upstream/Crossstream Obligations of the Swiss Guarantor, in order to enable the Swiss Guarantor to grant guarantees or security securing liabilities of the Issuers without the risk of violating such restrictions under Swiss law and to protect management from personal liability; such “limitation language” is standard market practice for, amongst others, indentures, guarantees and security documents in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Switzerland in the form of a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or Swiss limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). Limitations on the enforcement of any guarantee, indemnity and/or any security granted by the Swiss Guarantor apply in relation to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations. The ability of the Swiss Guarantor to assume Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations is restricted under Swiss law insofar as such Upstream/Crossstream Obligations must be within the corporate purpose and interests of the Swiss Guarantor and must not result in a repayment of the share capital (Einlagerückgewähr/Kapitalrückzahlung), a violation of legally 373 ----- protected reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) or other non-permitted distribution of assets to shareholders, board members or other persons close to the Swiss Guarantor. In light of the foregoing, the Indentures and/or any other relevant document to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will limit the amount of claims under, or proceeds from enforcement that can be applied to the satisfaction of any claim secured by, of any Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations assumed by the Swiss Guarantor to its freely distributable equity at the time of enforcement. Freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum amount that the Swiss Guarantor is permitted to distribute to its shareholders as a dividend payment under Swiss law at such time. Presently, the freely distributable equity capital is equal to the balance sheet profits, and any reserves available for distribution (minus, without double counting, any freely disposable equity that has to be blocked for any loans granted by the Swiss Guarantor to a direct or indirect parent company of the Swiss Guarantor or a direct or indirect subsidiary of any parent company pursuant to applicable Swiss corporate law and applicable accounting standards) at the time or times at which payment in relation to Upstream/ Cross-stream Obligations is requested. In addition, the enforcement of any Guarantee or Collateral granted by the Swiss Guarantor with respect to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations may give rise to Swiss withholding taxes (of up to 35% at present rates, subject to applicable double taxation treaties) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of such Guarantee or Collateral is regarded as a deemed dividend distribution. Under Swiss law, any obligation of the Swiss Guarantor to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax may not be valid and, thus, may prejudice the enforceability of anything to the contrary contained above under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Additional Amounts”, or “Description of the Senior Notes—Additional Amounts” or in the Indentures or any other documentation related to the Notes. In addition, any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax in connection with any Guarantee or Collateral granted by the Swiss Guarantor with respect to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations would in any case be limited by the amount of the freely distributable equity of the Swiss Guarantor. Further, the granting and/or enforcement of any Guarantee or Collateral with respect to Upstream/Cross-stream Obligations may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions. The Indentures and/or any other relevant documents to which the Swiss Guarantor is a party will expressly provide substantially as follows: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, the obligations of any Guarantor incorporated in Switzerland (a “Swiss Guarantor”) and the rights of any holder of a Note, the trustee or the Security Agent under this Indenture or the Notes are subject to the following limitations: (i) if and to the extent that a Swiss Guarantor is liable under this article or any other provision of this Indenture or of the Notes for obligations other than its own obligations or obligations of one of its direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries and that complying with such obligations would constitute a repayment of capital (Einlagerückgewähr), a violation of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich _geschützte Reserven) or the payment of a (constructive) dividend (Gewinnausschüttung) by such Swiss_ Guarantor (the “Swiss Restricted Obligations”), the aggregate liability of such Swiss Guarantor for Swiss Restricted Obligations shall be limited to maximum amount of the Swiss Guarantor’s freely disposable shareholder equity (the “Swiss Available Amount”) at the time such Swiss Guarantor is required to perform the relevant obligation under the Indenture or the Notes, provided that this is a requirement under applicable law at that time and further provided that such limitation shall not free such Swiss Guarantor from its obligation in excess thereof, but merely postpone the performance date therefore until such times as performance is again permitted notwithstanding such limitation. This Swiss Available Amount of freely disposable shareholder equity shall be determined in accordance with Swiss law and applicable Swiss accounting principles, and, if and to the extent required by applicable Swiss law, shall be confirmed by the auditors of the Swiss Guarantor on the basis of an interim audited balance sheet as of that time; (ii) immediately after having been requested to perform Swiss Restricted Obligations under the Indenture or the Notes, such Swiss Guarantor shall: (A) perform the Swiss Restricted Obligations which are not affected by the above limitations; and (B) in respect of any remainder, if and to the extent requested by the Security Agent or required under applicable Swiss law then in force, provide the Security Agent with an interim balance sheet audited by the statutory auditors of such Swiss Guarantor setting out the Swiss Available Amount and, immediately thereafter, pay the Swiss Available Amount (less, if required, any Swiss 374 ----- Federal Withholding Tax) to the Security Agent to the extent not already covered by the preceding sub-paragraph (ii)(A); (iii) in respect of Swiss Restricted Obligations, each Swiss Guarantor shall: (A) if and to the extent required by applicable law in force at the relevant time: (1) subject to any applicable double tax treaties, deduct tax levied pursuant to the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax Act ((Bundesgesetz über die Verrechnungssteuer vom 13 Oktober 1965, SR _642.21) together with the related ordinances, regulations and guidelines, all as amended and_ applicable from time to time (the “Swiss Federal Withholding Tax”)) at the rate of thirty five percent (35%) (or such other rate as is in force at that time) from any payment made by it in respect of Swiss Restricted Obligations; (2) pay any such deduction to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration; and (3) notify and provide evidence to the Security Agent that the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax has been paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration; and (B) to the extent such deduction is made, not be required to make a gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless any holder of a Note, the trustee or the Security Agent for the deduction of the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Indenture or the Notes, unless such payment is permitted under the laws of Switzerland then in force. Each Swiss Guarantor shall use its best efforts to ensure that any person which is, as a result of a payment under the Indenture or the notes, entitled to a full or partial refund of the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax, will, as soon as possible after the deduction of the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax, (1) request a refund of the Swiss Federal Withholding Tax under any applicable law (including double tax treaties) and (2) pay to the Security Agent upon receipt any amount so refunded; (iv) each Swiss Guarantor shall, and its parent shall procure that such Swiss Guarantor will, take and cause to be taken any action, including, without limitation, the passing of any shareholders’ resolution to approve any payment or other performance under this Indenture or the Notes and the receipt of any confirmation from such Swiss Guarantor’s auditors, which may be useful or required as a matter of Swiss mandatory law in force at the time it is required to make a payment or perform any other obligation under this Indenture or the Notes in order to allow a prompt payment and performance of obligations by the Swiss Guarantor under this Indenture or the Notes with a minimum of limitations; and (v) if the enforcement of Swiss Restricted Obligations would be limited due to the effects referred to in this section, then such Swiss Guarantor shall to the extent permitted by applicable law write up or realize any of its assets that are shown in its balance sheet with a book value that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets, in case of realization, however, only if such assets are not necessary for such Swiss Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig) and make payments based on the then Swiss Available Amount in accordance with this section.

The Company’s sole shareholder is Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., Luxembourg, an entity which is beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds. The acquisition of CABB Group was mainly financed by way of bonds, which were issued by Monitchem Holdco 2 S.A. and Monitchem Holdco 3 S.A. in June 2014 in Euro, constituting the main liability of the Group. The Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes and the Senior Secured Notes mature on June 15, 2021. There are no signs of any risks posing a threat to the continuing existence of the Group as of the reference date or until the maturity date of the Notes mentioned above. The business operations of CABB Group are organised in two business units, the Custom Manufacturing business unit and the Acetyls business unit. The Custom Manufacturing business unit focuses on the production of exclusives and intermediates. Exclusives are active ingredients and advanced intermediates customised for individual customers operating in the agrochemicals, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries (one product for one customer). Our exclusives are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides in the agrochemicals industry and range from pilot scale to large-volume commercial operations. Our intermediates are products manufactured for multiple customers and include acid chlorides, chemical building blocks and various base chemicals. They are to a large extent used in agrochemical applications but also in other diverse end-uses, such as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and X-ray contrast media. The Group is one of the leading custom manufacturing suppliers in the European agrochemicals market by revenues, serving the major global agrochemicals companies and holds strategic supplier status with the largest, European-based agrochemical companies for their agrochemicals business. Our customised products are highly integrated in our key customers’ supply chains (often protected by sole-supplier relationships for major products) and we are closely aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination. Our key agrochemicals customers are active in a structurally growing global market driven by population growth, improving living standards and changing dietary trends especially in emerging markets. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we operate complementary multi-purpose production facilities in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland). The Acetyls business unit is focused on the production of monochloroacetic acid (MCA), acetyl derivatives and co-products, which are primarily used in agrochemicals, food additives, personal care and cosmetic products but also in applications in a variety of markets, such as textiles, animal feed, vitamins and drilling fluids. Our key customers’ end-markets follow different demand patterns and demonstrate different levels of cyclicality, leading to a diversified market exposure for CABB and as such demonstrated relative resilience versus economic downturns. We produce MCA in different purity grades (ultra-pure, high pure, technical global and technical local) for different applications and regional markets and in different trade forms (flakes, solution, molten and sodium monochloroacetic acid) to enable longer distance transportation based on the customer’s preference and location. We also offer our customers a range of derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid and trichloroacetic acid, among others. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and are sold to customers or used captively in subsequent processes and production steps. We are one of the principal suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas. The Acetyls business unit operates three production facilities globally: two in Germany and one in China through our cooperation with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd..",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The other notes may be fully or partly redeemed at any time on or after June 15, 2017 for a defined redemption price. Such early redemption options were reported as embedded derivatives. Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control the bond issuers are required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes agreement defines certain covenants which, among other things, restrict the ability of the bond issuers and their subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain investments, transfer or sell certain assets, merge or consolidate with other entities or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Certain covenants will be suspended if the relevant notes obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating. The notes are recognised at their aggregate principal amounts plus accrued and unpaid interest. Transaction costs, which are amortised over the term of the notes, are deducted in an amount of kEUR 10,537 as of June 30, 2019 (December 31, 2018: kEUR 12,730). Embedded derivatives are added at their amortised value of kEUR 1,270 (December 31, 2018: kEUR 1,534).",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is calibrated such that the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (Bourse de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing model also considers the risk-free interest rate as another parameter. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. As in prior year there were no transfers between the different levels of the fair value hierarchies in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019. The derivative financial instruments (embedded derivatives in the indenture and interest rate swaps not included in a designated hedging relationship) are categorised as “at fair value through profit or loss”. They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). The value of the embedded derivatives is affected by the interest of the comparable market instrument on each potential exercise date and will rise if the relevant interest rate declines and vice versa. Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “at amortised cost” under IFRS 9 as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference date are approximately equivalent to the fair value. Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the interest income and expense, the amortisation of arrangement fees, bank fees and other fees, the result from the translation of foreign currencies and other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9.

The Company’s sole shareholder is Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., Luxembourg, an entity which is beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds. The business operations of CABB Group are organised in two business units, the Custom Manufacturing business unit and the Acetyls business unit. The Custom Manufacturing business unit focuses on the production of exclusives and intermediates. Exclusives are active ingredients and advanced intermediates customised for individual customers operating in the agrochemicals, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries (one product for one customer). Our exclusives are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides in the agrochemicals industry and range from pilot scale to large-volume commercial operations. Our intermediates are products manufactured for multiple customers and include acid chlorides, chemical building blocks and various base chemicals. They are to a large extent used in agrochemical applications but also in other diverse end-uses, such as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and X-ray contrast media. The Group is one of the leading custom manufacturing suppliers in the European agrochemicals market by revenues, serving the major global agrochemicals companies and holds strategic supplier status with the largest, European-based agrochemical companies for their agrochemicals business. Our customised products are highly integrated in our key customers’ supply chains (often protected by sole-supplier relationships for major products) and we are closely aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination. Our key agrochemicals customers are active in a structurally growing global market driven by population growth, improving living standards and changing dietary trends especially in emerging markets. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we operate complementary multi-purpose production facilities in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland). The Acetyls business unit is focused on the production of monochloroacetic acid (MCA), acetyl derivatives and co-products, which are primarily used in agrochemicals, food additives, personal care and cosmetic products but also in applications in a variety of markets, such as textiles, animal feed, vitamins and drilling fluids. Our key customers’ end-markets follow different demand patterns and demonstrate different levels of cyclicality, leading to a diversified market exposure for CABB and as such demonstrated relative resilience versus economic downturns. We produce MCA in different purity grades (ultra-pure, high pure, technical global and technical local) for different applications and regional markets and in different trade forms (flakes, solution, molten and sodium monochloroacetic acid) to enable longer distance transportation based on the customer’s preference and location. We also offer our customers a range of derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid and trichloroacetic acid, among others. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and are sold to customers or used captively in subsequent processes and production steps. We are one of the principal suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas. The Acetyls business unit operates three production facilities globally: two in Germany and one in China through our cooperation with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd..",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,300,REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE,300.26,(2) Principles of preparing the consolidated financial statements,300.26.1,New standards and interpretations adopted by the Group,"With effect from January 1, 2018, the Group has, where necessary and appropriate, applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union. As required by IAS 8.28(b) and IAS 8.28(e), the nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below: - _Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016): Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28 (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union was issued on February 7, 2018) - Amendment to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union was issued on March 14, 2018) - Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-Based Payment Transactions (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union was issued on February 26, 2018) - Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 3, 2017) - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: On July 24, 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, concluding the multiyear project to replace IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 contains, in particular, new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets, fundamental changes regarding the accounting treatment of impairments of certain financial assets, and a revised approach to hedge accounting. IFRS 9 retains “amortised costs” and “fair value” as the criteria for measuring financial instruments and continues to differentiate between changes in fair value recognised through profit or loss and through other comprehensive income. Whether financial assets are measured at amortised cost or fair value will depend on two factors: the entity’s business model for managing the portfolio to which the financial asset belongs and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. The recognition of financial asset impairments is based on expected losses according to IFRS 9. Unlike in IAS 39, under IFRS 9 impairments of financial assets, that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, are not just recognised when there is objective evidence of impairment. Rather, impairment allowances are also to be recognised for expected credit losses. The general approach adopts a three-stage model to assess the provision for risks. The model requires different degrees of impairment based on the credit default risk of the counterparties. For certain financial instruments, such as trade accounts receivables, operational simplifications for recognising impairment losses apply. Expected losses on trade accounts receivable are largely calculated on the basis of internal or external customer ratings and the associated probability of default. The IFRS 9 regulations on hedge accounting aim for a closer alignment of hedge accounting with the entity’s risk management strategy. (An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 22, 2016). At CABB, the first-time adoption of IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018, follows the modified retrospective method. Transition effects are recognised cumulatively in equity as of the date of initial application without restating prior-period information, which continues to be presented in accordance with IAS 39. At CABB, transition effects from the first-time adoption of IFRS 9 are primarily resulting from the recognition of additional impairments in accordance with the expected loss model, increasing the valuation allowances for trade receivables in an amount of kEUR 250. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of kEUR �199 were recognised in retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. F-29 ----- The table below presents the effects of the transition from IAS 39 on the carrying amounts as of December 31, 2017, by category of financial instruments: With effect from January 1, 2017, the Group has, where necessary and appropriate, applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union. As required by IAS 8.28(b) and IAS 8.28(e), the nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below: - Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 6, 2017. The amendments aim to improve the information provided about changes to an entity’s liabilities arising from financing activities. They specify that an entity must disclose changes to financial liabilities and related financial assets for which payments received and payments made are shown under cash provided by/used in financing activities in the statement of cash flows. The amendments to IAS 7 have been implemented as set out in the notes under item (29). - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 6, 2017. The amendments to IAS 12 mainly aim to clarify how to account for deferred tax assets for unrealised losses related to assets measured at fair value. - _Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016): Amendments to IFRS 12. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 6, 2017): In IFRS 12 it was clarified that disclosures pursuant to IFRS 12 generally also apply to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, with the exception of the disclosures outlined in IFRS 12.B10-B16 (Financial Information). Except for the amendments to IAS 7 (see note (29)), these amendments and clarifications did not have a significant impact on CABB Group’s consolidated financial statements. The following IFRSs and their interpretations are not yet in force or not yet endorsed by the European Union in 2017. Other new standards or interpretations have no material impact on CABB Group. The estimated impact of the adoption of these standards on the Group’s equity as of January 1, 2018 is based on assessments undertaken to date and is summarised below. The actual impacts of adopting the standards at 1 January 1, 2018 may change. - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers: The IASB published the new standard on revenue recognition, IFRS 15 – Revenues from Contracts with customers, on May 28, 2014. The endorsement by the European Union was issued in the third quarter 2016. The revised standard particularly aims to standardise existing regulations and thus improve transparency and the comparability of financial information. The rules and definitions of IFRS 15 supersede the content of IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRC 13, IFRIC 15, IFRIC 18 and SIC 31. The new standard does not differentiate between different types of contracts and services, but rather introduces uniform criteria for the timing of revenue recognition. According to IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when control of the agreed-upon goods or services and the benefits obtainable from them are transferred to the customer. The transfer of major risks and rewards of ownership of the goods is only one deciding factor amongst others. Revenue is measured at the amount the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods and services. The new model for the determination of revenue recognition is based on five steps, whereby the contract with the customer and the individual performance obligations within the contract are initially identified. The transaction price is then determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract. Finally, revenue is recognised for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service is provided and the customer gains control. Principles are set out for determining whether the good or service has been provided over time or at a point in time. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on October 31, 2017. F-88 ----- The Group will apply IFRS 15 for the first time as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative effect recognised in equity, without restatement of comparative information. Based on its analysis, the Group expects that the introduction of the new standard will lead to changes in the balance sheet in the form of new balance sheet items “contract assets” and “contract liabilities”, as well as additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures in the notes. Within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, revenues for the product group “Exclusives” will be recognised over time instead of at a certain point in time. The Group expects that this will result in an increase of equity between €1 million and €2 million, the recognition of contractual assets between €5 million and €6 million, a reduction of inventories in an amount of between € 3 million and € 4 million and a recognition of deferred tax liabilities of approximately € 0.5 million. For certain contracts within the product group “Exclusives”, the performance obligation consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities in exchange of a remuneration, which is classified as a “stand ready obligation”. The Group expects that his will result in a decrease of equity between €3 million and €4 million, contractual liabilities between €4 million and €5 million and a recognition of deferred tax assets of approximately € 1 million. Within the business unit Acetyls, the transition to IFRS 15 will have no significant impact, as customer contracts generally only give rise to a single performance obligation in each case, which is to be fulfilled at a certain point in time. - IFRS 16 Leases: The IASB published the new standard IFRS 16 Leases on January 13, 2016. The rules and definitions of IFRS 16 supersede the content of IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC 15 and SIC 27. The new standard introduces a single lessee accounting model. It requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than twelve months, unless the underlying asset is of low value (USD 5,000). As for the lessor, the new standard substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements of IAS 17. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 permitting an earlier adoption. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on October 31, 2017. The Group will apply IFRS 16 for the first time as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method and selected practical expedients without any impacts on retained earnings and without a restatement of comparative information. The Group decided to apply the recognition exemption for leases of low value items (USD 5,000), but will not apply the recognition exemption to leases with a remaining term of twelve months or less on the transition date. However, it is assumed that a significant number of leasing agreements that currently represent operating leases are to be reported in the balance sheet which will increase the Group’s total assets between €8 million and €9 million. Furthermore under the new standard, the type of expenses associated with operating leases will change, as IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line expenses for operating leases with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expenses on liabilities arising from the transition to IFRS. - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: On July 24, 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, concluding the multiyear project to replace IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 contains new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, fundamental changes regarding the accounting treatment of financial asset impairments, and a reformed approach to hedge accounting. IFRS 9 retains “amortised costs” and “fair value” as the criteria for measuring financial instruments. Whether financial assets are measured at amortised cost or fair value will depend on two factors: the entity’s business model for managing the portfolio to which the financial asset belongs and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. In the future, the recognition of financial asset impairments is based on expected losses according to IFRS 9. The general approach adopts a three-stage model to assess the provision for risks. The model requires different degrees of impairment based on the credit default risk of the counterparties. For certain financial instruments, such as trade accounts receivables, operational simplifications for recognising impairment losses apply. In the future, expected losses on trade accounts receivable will largely be calculated on the basis of internal or external customer ratings and the associated probability of default. The IFRS 9 regulations on hedge accounting aim for a closer alignment of hedge accounting with the entity’s risk management strategy. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 29, 2016. F-89 ----- The Group will apply IFRS 9 for the first time as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Based on its analysis, the Group does not expect material effects on its consolidated financial statements. - Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 3, 2017). - Amendments to IFRS 15 Revenues from Contracts with Customers (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement of the amendments was issued by the European Union on October 31, 2017). The amendments clarify various regulations in IFRS 15 and provide transition relief for the new standard. Beyond clarification, the changed standard also contains two additional practical expedients for reducing complexity and cost in the transfer to the new standard. These concern options by the start of the earliest-presented period or that have been changed before the start of the earliest-presented period. - Supplementary information on IFRIC 22 Foreign currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union is pending). - _Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014-2016): Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28 (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union is pending). - Amendment to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union is pending). - Amendment to IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019). (An endorsement by the European Union is pending). - Amendment to IFRS 9 Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019). (An endorsement by the European Union is pending). - Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its _Associate or Joint Venture. The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 on September 11,_ 2014. The amendments address a known inconsistency between the requirements of IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (2011) in the case of the sale of an asset to an associated company or a joint venture or the contribution of an asset to an associated company or a joint venture. The IASB has postponed the effective date of the changes indefinitely. - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021). (An endorsement by the European Union is pending). - Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-Based Payment Transactions (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018). (An endorsement by the European Union is pending). - _Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2015-2017): Amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23 (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019). (An endorsement by the European Union is pending). We are currently evaluating the impact of the application of those standards according to the required application date in the financial years 2018 to 2019 on the consolidated financial statements. Early adoption of the standards before endorsement by the European Union is not planned. With effect from January 1, 2016, the Group has, where necessary and appropriate, applied certain new and amended standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union. As required by IAS 8.28(b) and IAS 8.28(e), the nature and the effect of these changes are disclosed below: - _Amendments to IAS 1 – Disclosure Initiative (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016): On December 18, 2014, the IASB issued amendments made to IAS 1. The revisions pertain to various disclosure requirements, and clarify that information needs to be disclosed in the notes only if it is material for the company. This explicitly applies if a standard calls for a list of minimum disclosures. Explanations are moreover provided on the aggregation and disaggregation of line items in the balance sheet and statement of profit or loss. Furthermore, the revised standard clarifies how an entity’s share of the other comprehensive income of equity-accounted companies is to be presented in the statement of profit or loss. The changes will be effective for reporting periods beginnning on or after January 1, 2016. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on December 19, 2015. - _Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016): The IASB issued amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 on May 12, 2014. These revisions provide further guidance on determining an acceptable method of depreciation and amortization. Revenue-based methods are not permissible for property, plant and equipment and are only permissible for intangible assets in specific exceptional cases (rebuttable presumption of inappropriateness). An endorsement by the European Union was issued on December 3, 2015. - _Amendments to IAS 19 – Employee Contributions to Defined Benefit Plans (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015): The IASB issued amendments to IAS 19 on November 21, 2013. The amendments clarify requirements dealing with the allocation to service periods of employee or third-party contributions in cases where these are linked to the service period. Furthermore, practical expedients were made for cases where contributions are independent from the number of service years. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on January 9, 2015. - _Amendments to IFRS 11 – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016): The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 11 on May 6, 2014. IFRS 11 includes regulations on the recognition of assets and liabilities and gains or losses of joint ventures and joint operations. Whereas joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, joint operations, according to IFRS 11, are recognised in a similar fashion to proportional consolidation. With the amendment to IFRS 11, IASB regulates the accounting for the acquisition of shares in a joint operation, which constitutes a business according to IFRS 3 – Business Combinations. In such cases, the acquirer shall apply the principles of accounting for business combinations according to IFRS 3. Furthermore, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 3 also apply in such cases. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on November 15, 2015. - _Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015): Under its Annual Improvement Project, the IASB issued amendments to several standards on December 12, 2013. The affected standards are IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 8, IFRS 13, IAS 16, IAS 24 and IAS 38. The amendments address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions or serve to standardise terminology. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on January 9, 2015. - _Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016): Under its Annual Improvement Project, the IASB issued amendments to several standards on September 25, 2014. The affected standards are IAS 19, IAS 34, IFRS 5 and IFRS 7. The amendments address details of the recognition, measurement and disclosure of business transactions or serve to standardise terminology. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on December 16, 2015.

The following IFRSs and their interpretations are not yet in force or not yet endorsed by the European Union in 2016. Other new standards or interpretations have no material impact on CABB Group. - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: On July 24, 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, concluding the multiyear project to replace IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurment. IFRS 9 contains new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial instruments, fundamental changes regarding the accounting treatment of financial asset impairments, and a reformed approach to hedge accounting. IFRS 9 retains “amortised costs” and “fair value” as the criteria for measuring financial instruments. Whether financial assets are measured at amortised cost or fair value will depend on two factors: the entity’s business model for managing the portfolio to which the financial asset belongs and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. In the future, the recognition of financial asset impairments is based on expected losses according to IFRS 9. The general approach adopts a three-stage model to assess the provision for risks. The model requires different degrees of impairment based on the credit default risk of the counterparties. For certain financial instruments, such as trade accounts receivables, operational simplifications for recognising impairment losses apply. The IFRS 9 regulations on hedge accounting aim for a closer alignment of hedge accounting with the entity’s risk management strategy. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. An endorsement by the European Union was issued in the fourth quarter of 2016. - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with customers: The IASB published the new standard on revenue recognition, IFRS 15 – Revenues from Contracts with customers, on May 28, 2014. The revised standard particularly aims to standardise existing regulations and thus improve transparency and the comparability of financial information. The rules and definitions of IFRS 15 supersede the content of IAS 11, IAS 18, IFRC 13, IFRIC 15, IFRIC 18 and SIC 31. The new standard does not differentiate between different types of contracts and services, but rather introduces uniform criteria for the timing of revenue recognition. According to IFRS 15, sales revenue is recognised when control of the agreed-upon goods or services and the benefits obtainable from them are transferred to the customer. The transfer of major risks and rewards of ownership of the goods is no longer deciding factor. Sales revenue is measured as the amount the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods and services. The new model for the determination of revenue recognition is based on five steps, whereby the contract with the customer and the individual performance obligations within the contract are initially identified. The transaction price is then determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract. Finally, sales are recognised for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service has been provided or the customer receives control over it. Principles are set out for determining whether the good or service has been provided over time or at one point in time. The new standard’s potential impact on the Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations is being assessed. Based on a analysis covering both business units, the major types of contracts were identified and analysed with regards to changes in accounting under IFRS 15. Based on the results, the need for adjustments is currently being assessed. CABB assumes that fulfillment of the new standard’s requirements will require the introduction of the balance sheet items “contractual asset” and “conractual liability” as well as more comprehensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. An endorsement by the European Union was issued in 2016. F-134 ----- - IFRS 16 Leases: The IASB published the new standard IFRS 16 Leases on January 13, 2016. The rules and definitions of IFRS 16 supersede the content of IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC 15 and SIC 27. The new standard introduces a single lessee accounting model. It requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than twelve months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. As for the lessor, the new standard substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements of IAS 17. The new standard’s potential impact on the Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations is currently being analysed, a conclusive assessment of the effects is not possible. The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019.

The amendments clarify various regulations in IFRS 15 and provide transition relief for the new standard. Beyond clarification, the changed standard also contains two additional practical expedients for reducing complexity and cost in the transfer to the new standard. These concern options by the start of the earliest-presented period or that have been changed before the start of the earliest-presented period. - Supplementary information on IFRC 22 Foreign currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018).

A significant increase in the counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The significance of the increase in credit risk is not reviewed for financial assets subject to the simplified approach. CABB calculates the expected credit losses of a financial asset as the probability-weighted present value of each expected cash short-fall. As a general rule, three key parameters are used: the probability of default of the counterparty, the loss ratio if the counterparty defaults, and the amount at risk. In the case of receivables from banks, the expected credit losses are primarily calculated on the basis of the probabilities of default derived from credit default swaps for the counterparty concerned. The effects of the change to the valuation allowance model on the impairments recognised in accordance with IAS 39 as of December 31, 2017, are presented in the table below.

The revised standard particularly aims to standardise existing regulations and thus improve transparency and the comparability of financial information.

In accordance with IFRS 15.C7, only contracts that had not yet been completed as of the date of initial application were transitioned to the new standard. Contract modifications arising prior to the date of first-time application (IFRS 15.C7 A(b)) did not have to be accounted for.

Revenue for these products are now recognised when payments become unconstrained, leading to an earlier revenue recognition as compared to revenue recognition under IAS 18. As of January 1, 2018, this change led to the recognition of contract assets in an amount of kEUR 5,500 and to a reduction of inventories in an amount of kEUR 3,640. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of kEUR 1,476 increasing retained earnings were recognised as of January 1, 2018. For certain contracts within the product group “Exclusives”, the performance obligation consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities (“stand ready obligation”) within the contract period, leading to a deferred revenue recognition as compared to revenue recognition under IAS 18. As of January 1, 2018, this change led to the recognition of contract liabilities in an amount of kEUR 3,830. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of kEUR 3,059 reducing retained earnings were recognised. Within the business unit Acetyls, the transition to IFRS 15 had no impact on the timing of revenue recognition, as customer contracts refer to standardised products, which generally only give rise to a performance obligation, which is to be fulfilled at a certain point in time. As of January 1, 2018, due to the changed timing of revenue recognition, CABB recognised contract assets of kEUR 5,500, a decrease in inventories of kEUR 3,640 and contract liabilities of kEUR 3,830. Taking deferred taxes into account, transition effects of kEUR �1,583 were recognised in retained earnings as of January 1, 2018.

These concern options by the start of the earliest-presented period or that have been changed before the start of the earliestpresented period. - IFRS 16 Leases: The IASB published the new standard IFRS 16 Leases on January 13, 2016. The rules and definitions of IFRS 16 supersede the content of IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC 15 and SIC 27. The new standard introduces a single lessee accounting model. It requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than twelve months, unless the underlying asset is of low value (USD 5,000). As for the lessor, the new standard substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements of IAS 17. An endorsement by the European Union was issued on October 31, 2017. The Group applies IFRS 16 early for the first time as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method and selected practical expedients without any impacts on retained earnings and without a restatement of comparative information, which is presented in line with the previous rules under IAS 17. At transition, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at January 1, 2018. Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. The Group applied this approach to all leases. The application of IFRS 16 did not lead to any impacts on retained earnings. The Group used the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17: (a) application of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. The Group decided to not apply the recognition exemption for: (a) leases of low value items (USD 5,000); (b) leases with a remaining term of twelve months or less on the transition date. For leases that were previously classified as finance lease under IAS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability as of January 1, 2018 are determined at the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability under IAS 17 immediately before the date of initial application. In conjunction with the transition to the new accounting standard, right-of-use assets of kEUR 10,220 and lease liabilities of kEUR 10,214 were recognised as of January 1, 2018. The weighted-average rate applied is 3.94%.

CABB has elected to retrospectively apply the standard only to contracts that are not completed contracts at the date of first-time application. According to IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when control of the agreed-upon goods or services and the benefits obtainable from them are transferred to the customer. The transfer of major risks and rewards of ownership of the goods is only one deciding factor amongst others. Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration specified in contracts with customers for goods and services. The new model for the determination of revenue recognition is based on five steps, whereby the contract with the customer and the individual performance obligations within the contract are initially identified. The transaction price is then determined and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract. Finally, revenue is recognised for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service is provided and the customer gains control. Within the Custom Manufacturing business unit, revenues for the product group “Exclusives”, are recognised over time, whereby for certain contracts within the product group “Exclusives”, the performance obligation consists in ensuring the availability of production capacities in exchange of a fixed remuneration, which is classified as a “stand ready obligation”. Within the business unit Acetyls, customer contracts generally only give rise to a single performance obligation in each case, which is to be fulfilled at a certain point in time. The Group applied IAS 18 until December 31, 2017. According to IAS 18, revenues are recognised when products are delivered and risks and rewards have been transferred to the purchaser. Delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped to the specified location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the purchaser. The revenues comprise the fair value received for the sale of products, excluding sales taxes and taxes on consumption, less discounts and price reductions and after the elimination of internal revenues within the Group.

The Acetyls and Custom Manufacturing units have been identified as cashgenerating units (the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes) which carry goodwill.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at of before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line-method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The F-41 ----- estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: (a) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments; (b) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; (c) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and (d) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in ‘property, plant and equipment’ and lease liabilities in ‘loans and borrowings’ in the statement of financial position. The Group has elected to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Group has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for low-value assets, and recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on straight-line basis over the lease term. In the comparative period, leases were classified as finance leases and operating leases in accordance with IAS 17. Assets used by the Group as lessee under operating lease arrangements are not capitalised. The lease payments to be made are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. A finance lease is defined as a lease in which essentially all risks and rewards of an asset which are associated with ownership of the asset are transferred to the lessee. Assets used under finance lease arrangements are shown at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of minimum lease payments. The lease payment to be made is broken down into repayment of principal and an interest component. The repayment of principal reduces the liability, whereas the interest component is reported as interest expense. Depreciation is recognised over the economic useful life or the shorter life of the lease. The payment obligations resulting from the future lease instalments are shown under financial liabilities. Details of the leases are set out in the notes (15).",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, when CABB becomes a party of a financial instrument. Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash equivalents, and derivatives with positive fair values. Financial assets are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when CABB becomes a party to a financial instrument. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. The amount at which a financial asset is initially recognised comprises its fair value and in most cases the transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. F-42 ----- CABB began applying IFRS 9 as of January 1, 2018. Except for financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss, this requires the recognition of impairments for expected credit losses, independent of the existence of any actual default events and individual valuation allowances if evidence of a permanent need for impairment exists. If this evidence does not longer exist, the impairment is reversed in the consolidated statement of profit or loss up to the carrying amount of the asset had the default event not occurred. Valuation allowances are generally recognised in separate accounts. The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the one hand on the cash flow condition (the “solely payments of principle and interest” criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow characteristics of an individual financial asset. On the other hand, it also depends on the business model used for managing financial asset portfolios. Based on these two criteria, the following measurement categories are applicable: _Financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss include all financial assets whose cash flow are_ not solely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the cash flow condition established in IFRS 9. At CABB, derivatives are allocated to this measurement category, for example. CABB does not generally exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9, which permits the allocation of financial instruments not to be measure at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above category under certain circumstances. _Financial assets measured at amortised cost include all assets with contractual terms that give rise to cash_ flows on specific dates, provided that these cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow conditions in IFRS 9, to the extend that the asset is held with the intention of collection the expected contractual cash flows over its term. At CABB, this measurement category includes trade accounts receivables, as well as miscellaneous assets and certain securities. Initial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value, which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement effects are recognised in income using the effective interest method. Impairments are recognised for expected credit losses in both initial and subsequent measurement, even before the occurrence of any default event. If the counterparty is considered as having defaulted, an individual valuation allowance is generally recognised for the financial assets measured at amortised cost. In addition, a valuation allowance must be recognised when the contractual conditions that form the basis for the receivable are changed through renegotiation in such a way that the present value of the future cash flows decreases. The extend of expected credit losses is determined based on the credit risk of a financial asset, as well as any changes to this credit risk: If the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, expected credit losses are generally recognised over the lifetime of the asset. If, however, the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period, impairments are generally only recognised for the 12-month expected credit losses. By contrast, under the simplified approach for determining expected credit losses permitted by IFRS 9, impairments for receivables such as trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime expected credit losses of the receivable concerned. At CABB, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using both internal information and external rating information on the respective counterparts. A significant increase in the counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a certain number of notches. The significance of the increase in the credit risk is not reviewed for trade accounts receivable. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that the credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not have increased significantly. Regional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors and expectations are taken into account when assessing the need for a valuation allowance as part of the calculation of expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances. In addition, CABB uses internal and external ratings and the assessments of credit insurers, when available. Individual valuation allowances are also based on experience relating to customer solvency and customer-specific risks. Factors such as credit insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at amortised costs, are likewise considered when calculating valuation allowances. Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to an immaterial extent. Expected credit losses and individual valuation allowances are only calculated for those receivables that ere not covered by insurance or other collateral. The valuation allowances for receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not recognised in excess of the amount of the deductible. A decrease in valuation allowances due, for example, to a reduction in the credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after the valuation allowance is recorded in profit or loss. Reversals of valuation allowances may not exceed amortised cost, less any expected future credit losses. F-43 ----- _Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include all assets with_ contractual terms that give rise to cash flows on specific dates, which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the cash flow condition in IFRS 9, to the extend that the asset is not just held with the intention of collecting the expected contractual cash flows of its term, but also generating cash flows from its sale. At CABB, no contract incurred throughout the financial year 2018, which fulfils the criteria of described measurement category. CABB does not exercise the option to subsequently measure equity instruments through other comprehensive income. Assets measured at fair valued through other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value, which usually corresponds to the nominal value of the securities, allocated to its category at the time of acquisition. Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value. Changes in the time value are recognised in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of income when the asset is disposed of. Impairments on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at amortised cost and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The following measurement categories are used for financial liabilities: _Financial liabilities that are measured at amortised cost generally include all financial liabilities, provided_ these do not represent derivatives. They are generally measured at fair value at the time of initial recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of the consideration received. Subsequent measurement is recognised in profit or loss at amortised cost using the effective interest method. At CABB, for example, bonds and liabilities to banks reported under financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. _Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss contain derivative financial liabilities. These_ are likewise measured at the value of initial recognition. The latter also represents the measurement basis for these liabilities in subsequent measurement. The option to subsequently measure financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised. Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument. If IFRS requires separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately from its host contract and measured at fair value. If IFRS 9 does not provide for separation, the hybrid instrument is accounted for at fair value in its entirety. CABB applied IAS 39 in 2017. It required recognition of an impairment loss if there was evidence of a permanent impairment of a financial instrument not measure at fair value through profit or loss. If the reason for the impairment of loans and receivables as well as held-to-maturity financial instruments ceased to exist, the impairment was reversed up to the amortised cost and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Impairments on financial instruments were recognised in separate accounts. Financial assets, as defined by IAS 32, were classified at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired either as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, as loans and receivables, as held-to-maturity financial investments or as available-for-sale financial assets. The financial assets were measured at fair value upon initial recognition. In the case of financial investments other than those which are measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset are also recognised. CABB Group did not exercise the option to designate financial assets upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the end of the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets. The subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities reflects the category to which they are allocated. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The group’s loans and receivables mainly comprise trade accounts receivable and other financial assets. After initial recognition, financial assets in the category loans and receivables are shown at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairments. Receivables are generally reported with their amortised cost. An impairment of trade accounts receivable is recognised if there are objective indications that the due amounts are not fully recoverable. Considerable financial difficulties of a debtor, an increased probability that the borrower will become bankrupt or will have to go through another restructuring process, as well as any breach of contract, e.g. default or late payment of interest and principal, or where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows are considered to be an indication of the existence of an impairment. F-44 ----- Adequate amounts of individual allowances are recognised in relation to receivables which are likely to default. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Within CABB Group, impairment accounts are used for recognising impairments of trade accounts receivable. The amount of the impairment is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income under Distribution and Logistics expenses. Financial non-derivative assets which are intended to be held until maturity are measured at amortised cost. CABB Group has not reported any financial assets held to maturity as of the balance sheet date. In CABB Group, the category of available-for-sale financial assets comprises the remaining financial assets which have not been recognised in any other of the categories. At the time of initial acquisition and also subsequently, they are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are shown directly in a separate item of shareholders’ equity net of deferred taxes. Cumulative gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity as a result of subsequent fair value measurements are recognised in the statement of profit and loss only when the financial assets are sold or if the financial assets are permanently impaired. For equity instruments for which there is no price quoted in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably determined, the shares are measured at cost less any impairments. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash, demand deposits and other current highly liquid financial assets with an original maturity of maximum three months. Those highly liquid financial assets were debt securities and deposits acquired for meeting short-term commitments. Overdraft facilities which were utilised were shown as liabilities due to banks under current financial liabilities. Financial liabilities generally involved an obligation to return cash or another financial asset. These include in particular trade accounts payable, liabilities due to banks, liabilities under finance leases and derivative financial assets and liabilities. Upon initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are initially measured with their fair value. The transaction costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition are also recognised for all financial assets which are subsequently not measured at fair value through profit or loss. CABB Group did not exercise the option to designate financial liabilities upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Derivative instruments held for hedging purposes were not designated for hedge accounting. These instruments were classified as held for trading and measured with their fair value. A financial asset acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term is also classified as held for trading. In the financial year 2015, the Group entered into an interest rate swap contract (notional amount as of December 31, 2018: kEUR 175,000) with maturity date June 15, 2019. Under the interest rate swap contract, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange at specified intervals (primarily quarterly) the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts. Hedge accounting principles are not applied to these derivative financial instruments, which are entered into as an economic hedge. Embedded derivatives were separated from the host contract, which were not measured at fair value through profit and loss, if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative were not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Separable embedded derivatives were measured at fair value at initial recognition and at each subsequent balance sheet date. Following initial recognition, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments were recognised in the consolidated financial statement of profit and loss. Trade accounts payable are measured at amortised cost. Upon initial recognition, debt was presented at fair value after deduction of interest paid in advance and transaction costs, to the extent that these were not incurred for separate services. In subsequent periods, they were recognised at amortised cost in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, using the effective interest rate method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities were recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee was deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there was no evidence that it was probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee was capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. F-45 ----- Loan liabilities were classified as current liabilities provided that the Group does not have the unconditional right to postpone repayment of the liability to a point in time no earlier than 12 months from the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported with the net amount in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the forseeable future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

For this valuation an external expert was engaged. Management determined the appropriateness of the valuation techniques and inputs for fair value measurement used by the expert. The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. These assets are tested once a year for indications of impairments. If there are any such indications, estimates of the expected future cash flows from the utilisation and potential disposal of these assets are made for assessing the impairment. The actual cash flows may differ appreciably from the discounted future cash flows which are based on these estimates. Factors such as a change in the planned utilisation of buildings, machinery and equipment, technical aging or utilisation levels of installations which are lower than original forecasts may reduce the useful service life or may result in an impairment.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension fund (Pensionskasse – PK) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd. The calculations of the liabilities recognised with regard to these facilities are based on statistical and actuarial calculations of the actuaries. In particular, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation depends on assumptions such as the discount rate and the pension growth rate used for calculating the present value of the future pension obligations. Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of the future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by the Group also use statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions. The discount rate for the actuarial calculations of the German and Finnish defined-benefit obligations was determined by applying the Mercer Pension Yield Curve Approach (MYC). The data and methodology used to create the MYC is reviewed periodically by Mercer to ensure consistency and improved estimates.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

The underlying cash flow projection is based on past experiences, current results and on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. Market assumptions, such as the development of the overall economy and the market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industryspecific information sources. The financial projections were approved by management and consist of a detailed planning period of five years. A perpetual growth rate of 1.0% (2017: 1.0%) for the business unit Acetyls and 1.3% (2017: 1.3%) for the Custom Manufacturing unit is applied for the period beyond the five-year period and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for both businesses. For the business unit Acetyls, an average revenue growth of 1.4% (2017: 3.8%) and an average EBITDAmargin of 16.8% (2017: 16.1%) are assumed. The future cash flows generated by the business unit Acetyls are discounted at a post-tax rate of 6.6% (2017: 7.3%). For the business unit Custom Manufacturing, an average revenue growth of 5.0% (2017: 3.5%) and an average EBITDA-margin of 25.5% (2017: 29.1%) are assumed. The future cash flows generated by the business unit Custom Manufacturing are discounted at a post-tax rate of 7.5% (2017: 6.8%). The cashflow projection is influenced by the growth of the agrochemical market. The recoverable amount would equal the business unit’s carrying amount, if the cost of capital rate increased by 0.38 percentage points, or if the EBITDA of the last detailed planning year – as the basis for the terminal value – were lower by 4.9%.

In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension plan (Pensionskasse der CABB AG) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd., Ilmarinen (Finland). The pension fund of CABB AG is organised as an independent registered trust (registrierte Stiftung) and maintains a shift insurance plan and a regular pension plan. According to the deed of foundation, the trust has the purpose to provide benefits to retired employees of CABB AG in the form of pension payments for life and in case of disability or death within the framework of the Occupational Pension Act (Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge BVG). Alternatively, the employee can request a lump-sum payment of his accrued capital. The level of benefits provided depends in general on employees’ length of service and their salary for respective service years. F-62 ----- According to the pension plan rules, the pension benefits are financed by contributions of the employees, the employer and the fund. Art. 32 of the pension plan determines that in case the means of the fund are insufficient to meet the defined contributions by the fund, those contributions have to be made by the employer. Contributions to the Swiss pension fund are expected to remain stable in the short to medium term as payments are based on fixed percentages of pensionable benefits. If there is a funding shortfall, the Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) can implement measures including: changing benefits, lowering the returns credited to employees and changing the conversion rate. If the measures are not sufficient to improve the funding level, and as a last resort, the fund can ask the employer and employees to make additional contributions to close the gap. CABB AG would then have to bear at least half of any extra payments. Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans under IAS 19R, as although contribution levels are in fact “fixed”, there is a potential risk of extra payments in future. Basis for the investment of plan assets is the investment regulation of the foundation dated December 10, 2013. This regulation ensures the compliance with Occupational Pensions Act (BVG) and best possible return within acceptable risk profile. Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) and Investment Commission (Anlagekommission) define the long term investment structure as well as objectives and benchmarks for the investments. Only bonds with solid credit risk rating (at least “BBB-”) are selected for investments. At least 50% of all bond investments are made in bonds with rating of “AA-” and higher. Investment guidance is reviewed on an annual basis. All persons involved in investment decisions for plan assets or otherwise employed by the pension fund are subject to confidentiality obligations and have to follow the ASIP (Swiss pension fund association) Charter. The defined benefit plans in Finland, Germany and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as: - **Interest risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition the decrease in interest rate will decrease interest expense; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plan assets. - **Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. - **Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition, defined benefit plans in Finland and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to the investment risk: Decrease in the fair value of plan assets can create a plan deficit. In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is calculated using the actuarial valuation method for current one-off premiums or in accordance with the projected unit credit method on the basis of specific parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligation to show the funded status of the obligation. The extent of the obligation as well as the plan assets are determined at regular intervals of not more than twelve months; in the case of all defined-benefit plans, they are calculated every year as of December 31. Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits. The following parameters have been used as the basis for determining the present value of the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 for domestic and international companies:",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

For the financial year 2018, the actual income from plan assets amounted to kEUR �10,477 (2017: kEUR 9,424) in Switzerland and to kEUR 854 (2017: kEUR 994) in Finland. In 2018, additional employer contributions of kEUR 4,690 (2017: kEUR 4,545) were made into statutory pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans). Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant: - If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligation would decrease by kEUR 15,002 (December 31, 2017: kEUR 14,979) (increase by kEUR 16,681; December 31, 2017: kEUR 16,657). - If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 13,028 (December 31, 2017: kEUR 12,908 (decrease by kEUR 12,045; December 31, 2017: kEUR 11,930). - If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 1,023 (December 31, 2017: KEUR 1,160 (decrease by kEUR 1,016; December 31, 2017: kEUR 1,126). F-66 ----- The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position.

Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control the bond issuers are required to make an offer to purchase the outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes agreement defines certain covenants which, among other things, restrict the ability of the bond issuers and their subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain investments, transfer or sell certain assets, merge or consolidate with other entities or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Certain covenants will be suspended if the relevant notes obtain and maintain an investment-grade rating.

Similar contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transactions in similar instruments. - **Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves. - **Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte Carlo simulation. For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is calibrated such that the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (Bourse de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing model also considers the risk-free interest rate as another parameter. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. The derivative financial instruments (embedded derivatives in the indenture and interest rate swaps not included in a designated hedging relationship) are categorised as “at fair value through profit or loss” in accordance with IFRS 9, respectively as “Held for trading” under IAS 39. They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). The value of the embedded derivatives is effected by the interest of the comparable market instrument on each potential exercise date and will rise if the relevant interest rate declines and vice versa. Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “at amortised cost” under IFRS 9 (IAS 39: “Loans and receivables”) as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference date are approximately equivalent to the fair value. Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the interest income and expense, the amortisation of arrangement fees, bank fees and other fees, the result from the translation of foreign currencies and other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments in accordance with IFRS 9 and respectively by IAS 39.

The Company’s sole shareholder is Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., Luxembourg, an entity which is beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds. The business operations of CABB Group are organised in two business units, the Custom Manufacturing business unit and the Acetyls business unit. The Custom Manufacturing business unit focuses on the production of exclusives and intermediates. Exclusives are active ingredients and advanced intermediates customised for individual customers operating in the agrochemicals, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries (one product for one customer). Our exclusives are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides in the agro-chemicals industry and range from pilot scale to large-volume commercial operations. Our intermediates are products manufactured for multiple customers and include acid chlorides, chemical building blocks and various base chemicals. They are to a large extent used in agrochemical applications but also in other diverse end-uses, such as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and X-ray contrast media. The Group is one of the leading custom manufacturing suppliers in the European agrochemicals market by revenues, serving the major global agrochemicals companies and hold strategic supplier status with the largest, European-based agrochemical companies for their agrochemicals business. Our customised products are highly integrated in our key customers’ supply chains (often protected by sole-supplier relationships for major products) and we are closely aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination. Our key agrochemicals customers are active in a structurally growing global market driven by population growth, improving living standards and changing dietary trends especially in emerging markets. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we operate complementary multi-purpose production facilities in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland). The Acetyls business unit is focused on the production of monochloroacetic acid (MCA), acetyl derivatives and co-products, which are primarily used in agrochemicals, food additives, personal care and cosmetic products but also in applications in a variety of markets, such as textiles, animal feed, vitamins and drilling fluids. Our key customers’ end-markets follow different demand patterns and demonstrate different levels of cyclicality, leading to a diversified market exposure for CABB and as such demonstrated relative resilience versus economic downturns. We produce MCA in different purity grades (ultra-pure, high pure, technical global and technical local) for different applications and regional markets and in different trade forms (flakes, solution, molten and sodium monochloroacetic acid) to enable longer distance transportation based on the customer’s preference and location. We also offer our customers a range of derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid and trichloroacetic acid, among others. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and are sold to customers or used captively in subsequent processes and production steps. We are one of the principal suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas, and our Acetyls business unit supplies MCA consumers in Europe. The Acetyls business unit operates four production facilities globally: two in Germany, one in India and one in China through our joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd. (formerly: Jining Jinwei Gold Power Co., Ltd.). In the course of a strategic realignment of the production in Southeast Asia, CABB Group sold all shares held in CABB (India) Ltd., Ahmedabad (India) to the local family company Anugrah on July 27, 2017.

The first step is to measure initially all assets, liabilities and additional intangible assets which are identifiable with their fair values at the acquisition date. The group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The consideration transferred is netted with the proportionate revalued shareholders’ equity which has been acquired. Any differences which result from this process are capitalised as goodwill and are written down only in the event of an impairment. If the proportionate amount of the acquisition of net assets measured at fair value exceeds the costs of purchase of the business combination, the identification and valuation of the identified assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired company as well as the measurement of the costs of purchase of the business combination are reassessed. Any difference remaining after the reassessment is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. The acquisition-related costs incurred for carrying out a business combination are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred.

The consideration transferred is netted with the proportionate revalued shareholders’ equity which has been acquired. Any differences which result from this process are capitalised as goodwill and are written down only in the event of an impairment. If the proportionate amount of the acquisition of net assets measured at fair value exceeds the costs of purchase of the business combination, the identification and valuation of the identified assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired company as well as the measurement of the costs of purchase of the business combination are reassessed. Any difference remaining after the reassessment is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss.

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets, as defined by IAS 32, are classified at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired either as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, as loans and receivables, as held-to-maturity financial investments or as available-for-sale financial assets. The financial assets are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. In the case of financial investments other than those which are measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset are also recognised. CABB Group has not exercised the option to designate financial assets upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities generally involve an obligation to return cash or another financial asset. These include in particular trade accounts payable, liabilities due to banks, liabilities under finance leases and derivative F-94 ----- financial assets and liabilities. Upon initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are initially measured with their fair value. The transaction costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition are also recognised for all financial assets which are subsequently not measured at fair value through profit or loss. CABB Group has not exercised the option to designate financial liabilities upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities reflects the category to which they are allocated. Derivative instruments held for hedging purposes are not designated for hedge accounting. These instruments are classified as held for trading and measured with their fair value. A financial asset acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term is also classified as held for trading. In the financial year 2015, the Group entered into an interest rate swap contract (notional amount as of December 31, 2017: kEUR 175,000) with maturity date June 15, 2019. Under the interest rate swap contract, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange at specified intervals (primarily quarterly) the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts. Hedge accounting principles are not applied to these derivative financial instruments, which are entered into as an economic hedge. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract, which is not measured at fair value through profit and loss, if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. Separable embedded derivatives are measured at fair value at initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting date. Following initial recognition, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in profit and loss. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The group’s loans and receivables mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and other financial assets. After initial recognition, financial assets in the category loans and receivables are shown at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairments. Please refer to the comments on receivables and other financial assets. Financial non-derivative assets which are intended to be held until maturity are measured at amortised cost. CABB Group has not reported any financial assets held to maturity as of the balance sheet date. In CABB Group, the category of available-for-sale financial assets comprises the remaining financial assets which have not been recognised in any other of the categories. At the time of initial acquisition and also subsequently, they are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are shown directly in a separate item of shareholders’ equity net of deferred taxes. Cumulative gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity as a result of subsequent fair value measurements are recognised in the statement of profit and loss only when the financial assets are sold or if the financial assets are permanently impaired. For equity instruments for which there is no price quoted in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably determined, the shares are measured at cost less any impairments. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, demand deposits and other current highly liquid financial assets with an original maturity of maximum three months. Those highly liquid financial assets are debt securities and deposits acquired for meeting short-term commitments. Overdraft facilities which are utilised are shown as liabilities due to banks under current financial liabilities. Receivables are generally reported with their amortised cost. An impairment of trade accounts receivable is recognised if there are objective indications that the due amounts are not fully recoverable. Considerable financial difficulties of a debtor, an increased probability that the borrower will become bankrupt or will have to go through another restructuring process, as well as any breach of contract, e.g. default or late payment of interest and principal, or where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows are considered to be an indication of the existence of an impairment. Adequate amounts of individual allowances are recognised in relation to receivables which are likely to default. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. F-95 ----- Within CABB Group, impairment accounts are used for recognising impairments of trade accounts receivable. The amount of the impairment is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income under Distribution and Logistics expenses. Trade accounts payable are measured at amortised cost. Upon initial recognition, debt is presented at fair value after deduction of interest paid in advance and transaction costs, to the extent that these are not incurred for separate services. In subsequent periods, they are recognised at amortised cost in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, using the effective interest rate method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Loan liabilities are classified as current liabilities provided that the Group does not have the unconditional right to postpone repayment of the liability to a point in time no earlier than 12 months from the balance sheet date. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported with the net amount in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the forseeable future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. A combined tax rate of 27.08% is used in Luxembourg. Country-specific tax rates are used for the other companies.

Provisions for pensions are based on actuarial computations made according to the projected unit credit method, which applies, among others, the following valuation parameters: future developments in compensation, pensions and inflation, the expected performance of plan assets, employee turnover and the life expectancy of beneficiaries. The resulting obligations are discounted by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate fixed rate bonds with an AA rating that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from periodic recalculation are recognised in other comprehensive income. They result from the variance between the actual development in pension obligations and pension assets and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year as well as the updating of actuarial assumptions.

Provisions are recognised for environmental protection measures and risks if, as a result of a past event, there is a current legal or constructive obligation to carry out measures. The probable settlement amount of non-current provisions is discounted, if the discounting effect is of a material nature. In this case, the probable settlement amount is recognised with its present value. The increase of the discounted amount resulting from the passage of time and the effect deriving from any change in the discount rate are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and classified as financial income or expense. Provisions for service anniversary payments are mainly calculated in accordance with actuarial principles. For semi-retirement agreements which have been concluded, the wage and salary payments to be made during the passive phase of the semi-retirement arrangement are accumulated in instalments, approved supplemental payments are accrued in instalments until the end of the exemption phase at the latest. Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The group recognised termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits.

For the purpose of the impairment test, long-term cash flow forecasts have to be made for the cash-generating units in the context of the development of the Group and also in the context of the development of the overall economy. Estimates of cost of capital are used to determine the pre-tax discount rate for discounting the cash flows.

The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. These assets are tested once a year for indications of impairments. If there are any such indications, estimates of the expected future cash flows from the utilisation and potential disposal of these assets are made for assessing the impairment.

The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension fund (Pensionskasse – PK) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd. The calculations of the liabilities recognised with regard to these facilities are based on statistical and actuarial calculations of the actuaries. In particular, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation depends on assumptions such as the discount rate and the pension growth rate used for calculating the present value of the future pension obligations. Future salary increases and increases in the other benefits to employees also influence the calculation of the present value of the future pension obligations. In addition, the independent actuaries engaged by the Group also use statistical data such as probability of departure and life expectancy of the insured parties for their assumptions.

The underlying cash flow projection was approved by management and consists of a detailed financial planning period of five years. A perpetual growth rate of 1.0% (2016: 1.0%) for the business unit Acetyls and 1.3% (2016: 1.3%) for the Custom Manufacturing unit is applied for the period beyond the three-year period and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for both businesses. The financial planning and assumptions are based on past experiences, current results and on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. For the business unit Acetyls, an average revenue growth of 3.8% (2016: 2.3%) and an average EBITDA-margin of 16.1% (2016: 16.9%) are assumed. For the business unit Custom Manufacturing, an average revenue growth of 3.5% (2016: 4.3%) and an average EBITDA-margin of 29.1% (2016: 24.4%) are assumed. Market assumptions, such as the development of the economy and market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific information sources. The future cash flows generated by the business unit Acetyls are discounted at a posttax rate of 7.3% (2016: 7.3%). The future cash flows generated by the business unit Custom Manufacturing are discounted at a post-tax rate of 6.8% (2016: 6.9%). As of December 31, 2017, the recoverable amount of the business unit Custom Manufacturing exceeded the carrying amount by approximately EUR 91.7 million. The cashflow projection used in the calculation of this quantitative estimation is influenced by the growth in the agrochemical market. The recoverable amount would equal the business unit’s carrying amount, if the cost of capital rate increased by 0.72 percentage points, or if the EBITDA of the last detailed planning year – as the basis for the terminal value – were lower by 9.8% Customer relations and technologies acquired in connection with the acquisitions have been measured as part of the purchase price allocation process; they are amortised over their expected useful life (between 7.9 and 13.8 years).

In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension plan (Pensionskasse der CABB AG) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd., Ilmarinen (Finland). The pension fund of CABB AG is organised as an independent registered trust (registrierte Stiftung) and maintains a shift insurance plan and a regular pension plan. According to the deed of foundation, the trust has the purpose to provide benefits to retired employees of CABB AG in the form of pension payments for life and in case of disability or death within the framework of the Occupational Pension Act (Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge BVG). Alternatively, the employee can request a lump-sum payment of his accrued capital. The level of benefits provided depends in general on employees’ length of service and their salary for respective service years. According to the pension plan rules, the pension benefits are financed by contributions of the employees, the employer and the fund. Art. 32 of the pension plan determines that in case the means of the fund are insufficient to meet the defined contributions by the fund, those contributions have to be made by the employer. Contributions to the Swiss pension fund are expected to remain stable in the short to medium term as payments are based on fixed percentages of pensionable benefits. If there is a funding shortfall, the Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) can implement measures including: changing benefits, lowering the returns credited to employees and changing the conversion rate. If the measures are not sufficient to improve the funding level, and as a last resort, the fund can ask the employer and employees to make additional contributions to close the gap. CABB AG would then have to bear at least half of any extra payments. Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans under IAS 19R, as although contribution levels are in fact “fixed”, there is a potential risk of extra payments in future. Basis for the investment of plan assets is the investment regulation of the foundation dated December 10, 2013. This regulation ensures the compliance with Occupational Pensions Act (BVG) and best possible return within acceptable risk profile. Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) and Investment Commission (Anlagekommission) define the long term investment structure as well as objectives and benchmarks for the investments. Only bonds with solid credit risk rating (at least “BBB-”) are selected for investments. At least 50% of all bond investments are made in bonds with rating of “AA-” and higher. Investment guidance is reviewed on an annual basis. All persons involved in investment decisions for plan assets or otherwise employed by the pension fund are subject to confidentiality obligations and have to follow the ASIP (Swiss pension fund association) Charter. F-109 ----- The defined benefit plans in Finland, Germany and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as: - **Interest risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition the decrease in interest rate will decrease interest expense; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plan assets. - **Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. - **Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition, defined benefit plans in Finland and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to the investment risk: Decrease in the fair value of plan assets can create a plan deficit. In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is calculated using the actuarial valuation method for current one-off premiums or in accordance with the projected unit credit method on the basis of specific parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligation to show the funded status of the obligation. The extent of the obligation as well as the plan assets are determined at regular intervals of not more than twelve months; in the case of all defined-benefit plans, they are calculated every year as of December 31. Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits. The following parameters have been used as the basis for determining the present value of the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2017 for domestic and international companies: The CABB Group provides its employees post-employment defined benefit plans. In Germany, retirement benefits are provided via the pension fund of the employees of the Hoechst Group VVaG. The Swiss employees of the Group are insured with the pension plan (Pensionskasse der CABB AG) of CABB AG, Pratteln, Switzerland. The retirement benefits of the Finnish employees are processed via the pension insurance company Ilmarinen Ltd., Ilmarinen (Finland). The pension fund of CABB AG is organised as an independent registered trust (registrierte Stiftung) and maintains a shift insurance plan and a regular pension plan. According to the deed of foundation, the trust has the purpose to provide benefits to retired employees of CABB AG in the form of pension payments for life and in case of disability or death within the framework of the Occupational Pension Act (Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge BVG). Alternatively, the employee can request a lump-sum payment of his accrued capital. The level of benefits provided depends in general on employees’ length of service and their salary for respective service years. According to the pension plan rules, the pension benefits are financed by contributions of the employees, the employer and the fund. Art. 32 of the pension plan determines that in case the means of the fund are insufficient to meet the defined contributions by the fund, those contributions have to be made by the employer. Contributions to the Swiss pension fund are expected to remain stable in the short to medium term as payments are based on fixed percentages of pensionable benefits. If there is a funding shortfall, the Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) can implement measures including: changing benefits, lowering the returns credited to employees and changing the conversion rate. If the measures are not sufficient to improve the funding level, and as a last resort, the fund can ask the employer and employees to make F-154 ----- additional contributions to close the gap. CABB AG would then have to bear at least half of any extra payments. Swiss pension plans are treated as defined benefit plans under IAS 19R, as although contribution levels are in fact “fixed”, there is a potential risk of extra payments in future. Basis for the investment of plan assets is the investment regulation of the foundation dated December 10, 2013. This regulation ensures the compliance with Occupational Pensions Act (BVG) and best possible return within acceptable risk profile. Foundation board (Stiftungsrat) and Investment Commission (Anlagekommission) define the long term investment structure as well as objectives and benchmarks for the investments. Only bonds with solid credit risk rating (at least “BBB-”) are selected for investments. At least 50% of all bond investments are made in bonds with rating of “AA-” and higher. Investment guidance is reviewed on an annual basis. All persons involved in investment decisions for plan assets or otherwise employed by the pension fund are subject to confidentiality obligations and have to follow the ASIP (Swiss pension fund association) Charter. The defined benefit plans in Finland, Germany and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as: - **Interest risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond yields. A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition the decrease in interest rate will decrease interest expense; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plan assets. - **Longevity risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. - **Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the defined benefit obligation. In addition, defined benefit plans in Finland and Switzerland typically exposes the Group to the investment risk: Decrease in the fair value of plan assets can create a plan deficit. In accordance with IAS 19, the present value of the defined-benefit obligation is calculated using the actuarial valuation method for current one-off premiums or in accordance with the projected unit credit method on the basis of specific parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the present value of the pension obligation to show the funded status of the obligation. The extent of the obligation as well as the plan assets are determined at regular intervals of not more than twelve months; in the case of all defined-benefit plans, they are calculated every year as of December 31. Actuarial gains and losses in the defined-benefit plans and also costs resulting from the asset ceiling are recognised in other comprehensive income. Plan assets which exceed the extent of the obligation are shown under financial assets, with due consideration being given to the capping limits.

For the financial year 2017, the actual income from the plan assets amounted to kEUR 9,424 (2016: kEUR 2,024) in Switzerland and to kEUR 994 (2016: kEUR 1,703) in Finland. In 2017, additional employer contributions of kEUR 4,545 (2016: kEUR 4,549) were made into statutory pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans). Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant: - If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligation would decrease by kEUR 14,979 (December 31, 2016: kEUR 14,852) (increase by kEUR 16,657; December 31, 2016: kEUR 16,526). - If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 12,908 (December 31, 2016: kEUR 12,759 (decrease by kEUR 11,930; December 31, 2016: kEUR 11,720). - If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 1,160 (December 31, 2016: KEUR 1,810 (decrease by kEUR 1,126; December 31, 2016: kEUR 1,736). The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position. The average duration of the benefit obligation at December 31, 2017 is 14.5 years (December 31, 2016: 14.4 years).

These notes contain early redemption options for a defined redemption price. In the financial year 2017, the Group reviewed the separation of embedded derivatives related to early redemption of the notes. The review revealed, that the separation criteria of an embedded derivative have been applicable in the financial statements since 2014. As a consequence, the Group recognised embedded derivatives related to early redemption options in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Group does not consider the effect of this separation being a material error in the sense of IAS 8.42 neither regarding the current financial statements adjustment, nor in any of the financial statements prior to 2017. However, in order to increase the transparency and to provide better communication to the markets, the errors have been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior years 2015 and 2016 by applying IAS 8.42 et seq. by analogy. The correction results in an increase of other long term financial assets and long term notes liability as well as in changes to interest expenses, other financial income/expenses and deferred taxes on income. There is no impact on operating, investing or financing cashflows due to this correction.

Similar contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transactions in similar instruments. - **Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves. - **Option pricing model (i.e. Embedded derivatives in the indenture): The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated using a standard option pricing model based on Monte Carlo simulation. For the valuation, the credit spread for fixed-rate bonds used in calculation is calibrated such that the model reproduces the current market price quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (Bourse de Luxembourg) at the respective valuation date. The option pricing model also considers the risk-free interest rate as another parameter. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. The derivative financial instruments (embedded derivatives in the indenture and interest rate swaps not included in a designated hedging relationship) are categorised as “Held for trading”. They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). The value of the embedded derivatives is effected by the interest of the comparable market instrument on each potential exercise date and will rise if the relevant interest rate declines and vice versa. Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “Loans and receivables” as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference date are approximately equivalent to the fair value. Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the interest income and expense, the amortisation of arrangement fees, bank fees and other fees, the result from the translation of foreign currencies and other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39.

The Company’s sole shareholder is Monitchem Holdco 1 S.à r.l., Luxembourg, an entity which is beneficially owned principally by funds advised by Permira Funds. The business operations of the CABB Group are organised in two business units, the Custom Manufacturing business unit and the Acetyls business unit. The Custom Manufacturing business unit focuses on the production of exclusives and intermediates. Exclusives are active ingredients and advanced intermediates customised for individual customers operating in the agrochemicals, pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries (one product for one customer). Our exclusives are primarily used in herbicides, fungicides and insecticides in the agrochemicals industry and range from pilot scale to large-volume commercial operations. Our intermediates are products manufactured for multiple customers and include acid chlorides, chemical building blocks and various base chemicals. They are to a large extent used in agrochemical applications but also in other diverse end-uses, such as vitamins for animal feed, coupling agents for silica-reinforced green tires and X-ray contrast media. The Group is one of the leading custom manufacturing suppliers in the European agrochemicals market by sales, serving the major global agrochemicals companies and hold strategic supplier status with the largest, European-based agrochemical companies for their agrochemicals business. Our customised products are highly integrated in our key customers’ supply chains (often protected by sole-supplier relationships for major products) and we are closely aligned in demand planning and supply chain coordination. Our key agrochemicals customers are active in a structurally growing global market driven by population growth, improving living standards and changing dietary trends especially in emerging markets. In the Custom Manufacturing business unit, we operate complementary multi-purpose production facilities in Pratteln (Switzerland) and Kokkola (Finland). The Acetyls business unit is focused on the production of monochloroacetic acid (MCA), acetyl derivatives and co-products, which are primarily used in agro chemicals, food additives, personal care and cosmetic products but also in applications in a variety of markets, such as textiles, animal feed, vitamins and drilling fluids. Our key customers’ end-markets follow different demand patterns and demonstrate different levels of cyclicality, leading to a diversified market exposure for CABB and as such demonstrated relative resilience versus economic downturns. We produce MCA in different purity grades (ultra-pure, high pure, technical global and technical local) for different applications and regional markets and in different trade forms (flakes, solution, molten and sodium monochloroacetic acid) to enable longer distance transportation based on the customer’s preference and location. We also offer our customers a range of derivatives, including MCA esters, glycolic acid and trichloroacetic acid, among others. Co-products, such as caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, are by-products from the production of chlorine and MCA and are sold to customers or used captively in subsequent processes and production steps. We are one of the principal suppliers of MCA to Western Europe and the Americas, and our Acetyls business unit supplies MCA consumers in Europe. The Acetyls business unit operates four production facilities globally: two in Germany, one in India and one in China through our joint venture with Shandong Lutai Chemical Co., Ltd. (formerly: Jining Jinwei Gold Power Co., Ltd.).",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Assets used by the Group as lessee under operating lease arrangements are not capitalised. The lease payments to be made are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. A finance lease is defined as a lease in which essentially all risks and rewards of an asset which are associated with ownership of the asset are transferred to the lessee. Assets used under finance lease arrangements are shown at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of minimum lease payments. The lease payment to be made is broken down into repayment of principal and an interest component. The repayment of principal reduces the liability, whereas the interest component is reported as interest expense. Depreciation is recognised over the economic useful life or the shorter life of the lease. The payment obligations resulting from the future lease instalments are shown under financial liabilities. Details of the leases are set out in the notes under item (25).",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
643_3,Offerings 2019.md,300,REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE,300.501,q)** **Financial instruments,300.501.1,,"A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets, as defined by IAS 32, are classified at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired either as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, as loans and receivables, as held-to-maturity financial investments or as available-for-sale financial assets. The financial assets are measured at fair value upon initial recognition. In the case of financial investments other than those which are measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset are also recognised. CABB Group has not exercised the option to designate financial assets upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities generally involve an obligation to return cash or another financial asset. These include in particular trade accounts payable, liabilities due to banks, liabilities under finance leases and derivative financial liabilities. Upon initial recognition, financial liabilities are initially measured with their fair value. The transaction costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition are also recognised for all financial assets which are subsequently not measured at fair value through profit or loss. CABB Group has not exercised the option to designate financial liabilities upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities reflects the category to which they are allocated. F-139 ----- Derivative instruments held for hedging purposes are not designated for hedge accounting. These instruments are classified as held for trading and measured with their fair value. A financial asset acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term is also classified as held for trading. In the financial year 2015, the Group entered into an interest rate swap contract (notional amount as of December 31, 2016: kEUR 175,000) with maturity date June 15, 2019. Under the interest rate swap contract, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange at specified intervals (primarily quarterly) the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts. Hedge accounting principles are not applied to these derivative financial instruments, which are entered into as an economic hedge. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The group’s loans and receivables mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and other financial assets. After initial recognition, financial assets in the category loans and receivables are shown at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairments. Please refer to the comments on receivables and other financial assets. Financial non-derivative assets which are intended to be held until maturity are measured at amortised cost. CABB Group has not reported any financial assets held to maturity as of the balance sheet date. In CABB Group, the category of available-for-sale financial assets comprises the remaining financial assets which have not been recognised in any other of the categories. At the time of initial acquisition and also subsequently, they are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are shown directly in a separate item of shareholders’ equity net of deferred taxes. Cumulative gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity as a result of subsequent fair value measurements are recognised in the statement of profit and loss only when the financial assets are sold or if the financial assets are permanently impaired. For equity instruments for which there is no price quoted in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably determined, the shares are measured at cost less any impairments. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, demand deposits and other current highly liquid financial assets with an original maturity of maximum three months. Those highly liquid financial assets are debt securities and deposits acquired for meeting short-term commitments. Overdraft facilities which are utilised are shown as liabilities due to banks under current financial liabilities. Receivables are generally reported with their amortised cost. An impairment of trade accounts receivable is recognised if there are objective indications that the due amounts are not fully recoverable. Considerable financial difficulties of a debtor, an increased probability that the borrower will become bankrupt or will have to go through another restructuring process, as well as any breach of contract, e.g. default or late payment of interest and principal, or where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows are considered to be an indication of the existence of an impairment. Adequate amounts of individual allowances are recognised in relation to receivables which are likely to default. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Within CABB Group, impairment accounts are used for recognising impairments of trade accounts receivable. The amount of the impairment is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income under Distribution and Logistics expenses. Trade accounts payable are measured at amortised cost. Upon initial recognition, debt is presented at fair value after deduction of interest paid in advance and transaction costs, to the extent that these are not incurred for separate services. In subsequent periods, they are recognised at amortised cost in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, using the effective interest rate method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

The deferred taxes on income are accrued on the basis of the current or substantively enacted local tax rate expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the liability method in relation to all temporary differences between the uniform measurement in the Group of assets and liabilities and the tax measurement of assets and liabilities, except if differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the forseeable future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. A combined tax rate of 29.22% is used in Luxembourg; country-specific tax rates are used for the other companies.

Actuarial gains and losses resulting from periodic recalculation are recognised in other comprehensive income. They result from the variance between the actual development in pension obligations and pension assets and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year as well as the updating of actuarial assumptions. The calculation of pension provisions is based on actuarial reports.

In the course of the purchase price allocation following the business combination with CABB Group, these assets were measured at fair value. For this valuation an external expert was engaged.

The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. These assets are tested once a year for indications of impairments. If there are any such indications, estimates of the expected future cash flows from the utilisation and potential disposal of these assets are made for assessing the impairment.

The underlying cash flow projection was approved by management and consists of a detailed financial planning period of three years. A perpetual growth rate of 1% (2015: 1%) for the business unit Acetyls and 1.3% (2015: 1.3%) for the Custom Manufacturing unit is applied for the period beyond the three-year period and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for both businesses. The financial planning and assumptions are based on past experiences, current results and on the best estimate of the future development of influencing factors. For the business unit Acetyls, an average revenue growth of 2.3% (2015: 2.7%) and an average EBITDA-margin of 16.9% (2015: 16.9%) are assumed. For the business unit Custom Manufacturing, an average revenue growth of 4.3% (2015: 3.8%) and an average EBITDA-margin of 24.4% (2015: 23.3%) are assumed. Market assumptions, such as the development of the economy and market growth are considered using external macroeconomical and industry-specific information sources. The future cash flows generated by the business unit Acetyls are discounted at a post-tax rate of 7.3% (2015: 7.5%). The future cash flows generated by the business unit Custom Manufacturing are discounted at a post-tax rate of 6.9% (2015: 6.6%). F-151 ----- As of December 31, 2016, the recoverable amount of the business unit Custom Manufacturing exceeded the carrying amount by approximately EUR 105 million. The cashflow projection used in the calculation of this quantitative estimation is influenced by the growth in the agrochemical market. The recoverable amount would equal the business unit’s carrying amount, if the cost of capital rate increased by 0.82 percentage points, or if the EBITDA of the last detailed planning year – as the basis for the terminal value – were lower by 9.4% Customer relations and technologies acquired in connection with the acquisitions have been measured as part of the purchase price allocation process; they are amortised over their expected useful life (between 7.9 and 13.8 years).

For the financial year 2016, the actual income from the fund assets amounted to kEUR 2,024 (2015: kEUR 461) in Switzerland and to kEUR 1,703 (2015: kEUR �407) in Finland. In 2016, additional employer contributions of kEUR 4,549 (2015: kEUR 4,691) were made into statutory pension insurance schemes (defined-contribution plans). Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase and mortality. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant: - If the discount rate is 50 basis points higher (lower), the defined benefit obligation would decrease by kEUR 14,852 (December 31, 2015: kEUR 15,911) (increase by kEUR 16,526; December 31, 2015: kEUR 17,861). - If the return on plan assets increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the pension provision would decrease by kEUR 1,580 (December 31, 2015: kEUR 1,968 (increase by kEUR 1,447; December 31, 2015: kEUR 1,521). - If the expected pension progression increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 12,759 (December 31, 2015: kEUR 13,381 (decrease by kEUR 11,720; December 31, 2015: kEUR 12,329). - If the expected salary growth increases (decreases) by 0.5%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by kEUR 1,810 (December 31, 2015: KEUR 2,056 (decrease by kEUR 1,736; December 31, 2015: kEUR 1,979). F-158 ----- The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position. The average duration of the benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 is 14.4 years (December 31, 2015: 14.6 years).

Similar contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transactions in similar instruments. - **Discounted cash flows (i.e. Derivatives (interest rate swaps)): financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example: derivatives/ interest rate swaps) are valuated considering the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. The derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps) are not included in a designated hedging relationship and therefore categorised as “Held for trading”. They are recognised at their fair value, depending on their fair value and their maturity on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments are included in financial assets (positive fair value) or in financial liabilities (negative fair value). Cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other financial assets in the category “Loans and receivables” as well as trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities mainly have short remaining terms. Accordingly, the figures shown in the balance sheet as of the reference date are approximately equivalent to the fair value. Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the interest income and expense, the amortisation of arrangement fees, bank fees and other fees, the result from the translation of foreign currencies and other effects on the earnings resulting from financial instruments. The line financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss contains only those gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39.

While these risks are relevant to the financing activities of the Group (long term notes), they are not of significant importance for the Group’s operating activities. Group financing policy was established in course of the acquisition of the Group and remained unchanged in its material aspects during the reporting period. Borrowings issued at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risks, which are to a large extend mitigated by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates. Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (primarily quarterly), the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts. Hedge accounting principles are not applied to these derivative financial instruments, which are entered into as an economic hedge.

The Company now assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the new definition of a lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. F-172 ----- On transition to IFRS 16, the Company elected to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the assessment of which transactions are leases. It applied IFRS 16 only to contracts that were previously identified as leases. Contracts that were not identified as leases under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 were not reassessed. Therefore, the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 has been applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after January 1, 2019. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and nonlease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Company has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options. The assessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Some other leases have terms for up to five years with one-year renewals each year. At transition, for leases classified as operating leases, under IAS 17, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as at January 1, 2019. The Company elected to measure the right-of-use asset at an amount equal to the lease liability at the transition date adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. As a result, at January 1, 2019, the right-of-use asset equaled the lease liability. Therefore, the cumulative effect of initial application recognized in retained earnings at January 1, 2019 is zero. F-173 ----- The Company used the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17. - Excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application. - Used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. _Opinion_ In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Jayhawk Fine Chemicals Corporation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and January 1, 2017, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. On initial designation of the hedge, the Company formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s), including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Company makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are expected to be “highly effective” in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within a range of 80-125 percent. For a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction should be highly probable to occur and should present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net income. Derivatives are recognized initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. The amount recognized in other comprehensive income is removed and included in profit or loss in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss under the same line item in the statement of comprehensive income as the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity remains there until the forecast transaction affects profit or loss. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognized. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognized immediately in profit or loss. In other cases the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements within the scope of IFRS 13 are categorized into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs are F-185 ----- observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The fair value of derivative instruments is determined based on industry-accepted valuation models using market observable inputs and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. F-186 ----- Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

The Company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognized past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the total of any unrecognized past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Company. An economic benefit is available to the Company if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.

A specific asset is the subject of a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specified asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the use of the underlying asset. At inception or upon reassessment of the arrangement, the Company separates payments and other consideration required by such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If the Company concludes for a finance lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, an asset and a liability are recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset. Subsequently the liability is reduced as payments are made and an imputed finance charge on the liability is recognized using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be F-188 ----- utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604

However, management also considers the demographics of the Company’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk. Approximately 18 percent of the Company’s revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single customer in 2018 and 2017. However, geographically there is no concentration of credit risk. The Risk Management Committee has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Company’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Company’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Risk Management Committee; these limits are reviewed quarterly. Customers that fail to meet the Company’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Company only on a prepayment basis. The Company establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for Companies of similar assets in respect of losses that are expected but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets. When determining the necessary allowance management considers historic collection history and creditworthiness for customers, including those disclosed in note 1(f) and the current general economic conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2019,604
