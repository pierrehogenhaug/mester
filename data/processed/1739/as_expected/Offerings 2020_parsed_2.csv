In our Global segment, we are continuing to focus on our traditional restaurant segments and customers, including quick service and fast casual burger and chicken chains, while also seeking to penetrate non-traditional frozen potato product outlets, such as convenience stores and coffee houses. We are also continuing to focus on fast-growing markets, like China and Southeast Asia, and support of our growing customers across North America and internationally. In our Foodservice segment, our strategy is to align resources to focus on the smaller quick service and fast casual chains in North America as they continue to add units and expand geographically, while continuing to support our distributor partners and independent restaurants. We are also looking to strengthen ties with other types of fast-growing outlets, such as entertainment venues and restaurants within grocery stores. In our Retail segment, we are focused on expanding distribution in an effort to gain share by continuing to leverage our three-tier strategy of offering premium Alexia-branded products, mainstream products through _Grown in Idaho and licensed brands and private label products._",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

Our supply chain team has a strong track record of stretching existing capacity to support volume growth, improving recovery rates and managing manufacturing costs to expand gross margins. In addition, we will seek to continue to build a true integrated end-to-end global supply chain, grounded in unified information systems and processes. These efforts are focused on further enhancing production efficiencies and cost savings across North America and with our joint venture partners. We also expect to continue to invest in manufacturing assets outside North America, as we look to create a raw potato sourcing model in emerging growing regions that is similar to the one that we built in the Pacific Northwest. This would enable us to have an ongoing supply of cost-advantaged raw product to meet the needs of our customers over the long term.",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

We have consistently committed capital to increase capacity. Over the past five years, in addition to the acquisitions we discussed above, we have invested more than $700 million to expand capacity, including new processing lines in Richland, Washington and Hermiston, Oregon. In addition, we have remained committed to our base capital program to reduce costs, stretch capacity and keep our factories well-maintained and enable operation at high utilization rates while maintaining our high standards for safety and quality. With these investments, we have been able to support our customers’ growth and gain share. Over the long-term, we expect to continue to invest in new capacity where we identify opportunities to grow and generate strong returns.

The additional $325.0 million term loan facility under the New NWFCS Credit Facility matures on April 20, 2025 and the proceeds of the borrowings under the facility will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As previously disclosed, we borrowed $495.0 million under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility in late March 2020 to increase our cash position as a precautionary measure and to preserve financial flexibility given uncertainties in the global markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use the proceeds of these borrowings for working capital and general corporate purposes. We refer to the issuance of the notes offered hereby, the entry into the New NWFCS Credit Facility and the March 2020 borrowings under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility collectively as the ‘‘Transactions.’’ See ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’",N/A,as_expected,2020,127
1739_2,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.18,Update on COVID-19,9.18.1,,"Efforts by national, state and local governments worldwide to control the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in widespread measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines, travel bans, shutdowns and shelter in place or ‘‘stay-at-home’’ orders, which have significantly restricted the movement of people and goods. These restrictions and measures, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and joint venture and other business partners, have affected and are continuing to affect our business and operations by, among other things, causing the closure of many full-service restaurants; reducing demand at quick service restaurants (‘‘QSRs’’); causing us to modify a number of our normal business practices, including the ongoing evaluation of our manufacturing employees’ COVID-19 symptom status; causing us to evaluate the need for facility closures or temporary shutdowns to protect employee health; disrupting production timing; disrupting our supply chain; disrupting the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the modification of business continuity plans; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing practices; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on-site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects and other capital expenditures; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce. 6 ----- Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of the restrictions and measures described above, in our largest market, the United States, approximately 80% of all commercial foodservice french fries consumed were purchased at QSRs, with approximately one-third of these purchased via dine-in, and two-thirds via drive-thru, carry-out or delivery. Since stay-at-home and other related restrictions and measures began as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, anecdotal reports suggest an increase in drive-thru, carry-out and delivery purchases, though not enough to offset lower overall consumer traffic. In contrast, the purchase of french fries for at-home consumption has increased. _2019 U.S. Commercial Foodservice Fry Market Overview_",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

Given the uncertainty and fluidity of the current situation, we have withdrawn our full-year guidance for fiscal 2020. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity to manage through the uncertain operating environment even if it is for an extended period of time, we have taken steps to increase our liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility, including reducing operating and overhead expenditures, deferring discretionary capital expenditures and suspending our share repurchase plan. In this regard, and out of an abundance of caution, we borrowed $495.0 million under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility and an additional $325 million under the New NWFCS Credit Facility, and we are offering the notes offered hereby. Set forth below is additional detail on the impact of COVID-19 on each of our business segments: _Global: Our Global segment is comprised primarily of sales to industry-leading QSRs. While_ traffic at these restaurants has been negatively impacted by stay-at-home and other related restrictions and measures, drive-thru, delivery and carry-out dining options remain available in many markets. In 2019, approximately two-thirds of U.S. QSR french fry servings were sold via drive-thru, delivery or carry-out, and preliminary indications are that an increase in those methods have partially offset lost dine-in sales at QSRs. _Foodservice: Approximately 80% of our Foodservice segment sales are ultimately made to_ full-service restaurants and outlets that have been negatively impacted by stay-at-home and other related restrictions and measures (the remaining approximately 20% of our Foodservice segment sales are to QSRs). We expect these full-service restaurants and outlets will be more severely impacted than QSRs. 7 ----- _Retail: Retail demand for frozen french fries has significantly increased as food-at-home_ consumption has risen. We have taken steps to increase production of retail products in order to better meet the increased demand for these products. Set forth below is additional detail regarding our exposure to our key geographic end markets: _North America: While the situation in the U.S. remains fluid, we are experiencing lower sales_ orders. We expect consumer traffic at full-service restaurants and operations in the U.S. to decrease significantly more than at QSRs. For the four weeks ended April 19, 2020, our North American shipments decreased approximately 40%, compared with the four weeks ended March 22, 2020, as our customers adjusted inventory levels in response to reduced demand due to stay-at-home orders and related restrictions and measures. This includes the increase we have seen in retail demand for frozen french fries in the U.S. _Europe: A high percentage of the sales of our joint venture Lamb-Weston/Meijer in Europe are_ to QSRs. Unlike the U.S., most consumption in European QSRs is via dine-in, carry-out or delivery as drive-thru options are limited. As a result, we expect the decline in french fry demand to be greater in Europe than in the U.S. For the four weeks ended April 19, 2020, our European joint venture’s shipments decreased almost 60%, compared with the four weeks ended March 22, 2020, as customers reduced inventory levels in response to reduced demand due to stay-at-home orders and related restrictions and measures. _China: A high percentage of our sales in China are to QSRs. Unlike the U.S., most_ consumption in QSRs in China is dine-in, carry-out or delivery as drive-thru options are limited. For approximately a one-month period in February 2020, our shipments made to customers in China decreased by approximately 50%, compared to the same period in 2019, due to stay-at-home orders and related restrictions and measures. Since then, our shipments made to customers in China have recovered to approximately 70% of pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. _Other Asian markets: Through April 19, 2020, we have experienced a modest impact on french_ fry demand in our other Asian markets, but are closely monitoring the situation. Our primary focus and attention during this extraordinary time remains directed toward the health, safety and well-being of our employees. To that end, we have instituted enhanced protocols at our manufacturing facilities in order to protect employees, such as screening employees’ temperatures, providing masks and requiring physical distancing. If an employee at one of our manufacturing facilities tests positive for COVID-19, we have developed plans to temporarily close the facility at which the employee works for a period of up to 14 days in order to sanitize and disinfect the facility before allowing employees to return to the facility and restart operations. While the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be estimated at this time, we are undertaking several operational measures to address the effects of the pandemic on demand for our products. In anticipation of reductions in demand for our products, we expect to reduce contracting of raw potatoes by approximately 20%-25% for the 2020 crop year, compared with our 2019 crop year purchases. In response to the potential reduction in demand for our products, we have taken actions, and will continue to evaluate various options, to lower our cost structure and maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing operations, which may include rebalancing utilization rates across our manufacturing network. 8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

The notes will initially be jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the issuer’s existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that incurs or guarantees indebtedness under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the NWFCS Credit Facilities (the ‘‘guarantors’’). None of our foreign subsidiaries or holding companies thereof will guarantee the notes and no foreign subsidiaries or such holding companies are expected to guarantee the notes in the future. See ‘‘Description of Notes — Guarantees.’’ As of February 23, 2020, the issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 19% of our total assets (8% of which is related to goodwill and intangible assets) and approximately 3% of our total liabilities.

We include (exclude) our proportionate share (our joint venture partner’s share) of interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense of our unconsolidated joint ventures (consolidated joint venture) given that we conduct meaningful business through these joint ventures and they provide us with significant access to cash through distributions. We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as EBITDA before the effect of certain expenses related to the spinoff and non-cash gains on assets for prior periods. We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures’’ as EBITDA before the effect of items impacting comparability such as gains or losses associated with pension plan settlements and gains or losses from the sale of assets. We exclude items impacting comparability to provide a better understanding of our core operating results given the significant impact these items have on the comparability of our operating results when comparing periods. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to enhance the understanding of our operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures are key measures we use to evaluate our operational performance. We provide EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures to be 15 ----- useful measures for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements. However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of operating results or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, and other companies in our industry may calculate these financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. As a result, these financial measures have limitations as analytical and comparative tools, and you should not consider these items in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results and cash flows as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect all of our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect certain impairments and adjustments for purchase accounting; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; - they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay taxes; - they do not take into account that our unconsolidated joint ventures may not distribute cash to us because of other required uses of cash such as principal and interest payments on debt, working capital requirements, contractual or legal restrictions or negative tax consequences; and - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and they do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

These restrictions and measures, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and joint venture and other business partners, have affected and are continuing to affect our business and operations by, among other things, causing the closure of many sit down restaurants; reducing demand at quick service restaurants; causing us to modify a number of our normal business practices including the ongoing evaluation of our manufacturing employees’ COVID-19 symptom status; evaluating the need for facility closures or temporary shutdowns to protect employee health; disrupting production timing; disrupting our supply chain; disrupting the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the modification of business continuity plans; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing practices; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on-site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects and other capital expenditures; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce. These impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause decreases in revenue and increases in costs resulting in decreased profitability and cash flows from operations, which have caused and are expected to cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations that may be material. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors and joint venture and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions. Any material adverse effect on these parties could adversely impact us. In this regard, the potential duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and on our business, financial condition and results of operations are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty, but the pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets, increases in levels of unemployment and economic uncertainty, which has adversely impacted our business and may continue to do so. These developments may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending, demand for our products, the ability of our customers to pay, our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers, and may also negatively impact our access to external sources of financing to fund our operations or make capital expenditures. 18 ----- The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this offering circular and in the sections entitled ‘‘Risk Factors’’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended February 23, 2020 (each of which is incorporated by reference in this offering circular), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

These commodities are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters (such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding), disease or pests, agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), limited or sole sources of supply, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. In addition, we also incur expenses in connection with the transportation and delivery of our products. Commodity price increases, or a sustained interruption or other constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities, including necessary services such as transportation and warehousing, may increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and decreased profitability. There is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the United States. Although we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases, these practices and experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases. As a result, the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend. In addition, our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive value-added frozen potato product category. We continue to implement profit-enhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and administrative functions. However, gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. In addition, we may have significant supply chain disruptions due to a number of factors outside of our control, including public health crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. These factors may lead to our inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner, which could lead to increased warehouse and other storage costs. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs, or the occurrence of a significant supply chain disruption or the inability to access or deliver products, could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position or otherwise harm our business.",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

These amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures, which are also subject to risks associated with international operations. Many factors relating to our international sales and operations, many of which factors are outside of our control, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including: - foreign exchange rates, foreign currency exchange and transfer restrictions, which may unpredictably and adversely impact our combined operating results, asset and liability balances, and cash flow in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency; - our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes; - changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and foreign governments, including modification or termination of existing trade agreements (e.g., the North American Free Trade Agreement) or treaties, creation of new trade agreements or treaties (e.g. the United States — Mexico — Canada Agreement), trade regulations, and increased or new tariffs, quotas, import or export licensing requirements, and other trade barriers imposed by governments. In particular, changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of trade protection measures by foreign countries in favor of their local producers of competing products, such as governmental subsidies, tax benefits, and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over Lamb Weston, may adversely affect our business and results of operations in those countries; - negative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments, including the threat of wars, terrorist attacks, epidemics or civil unrest; - pandemics and other public health crises, such as the flu and in particular the current COVID-19 pandemic, which may disrupt our supply chain or otherwise increase our storage, production or distribution costs and adversely affect our workforce, local suppliers, customers and consumers of our products; 20 ----- - earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, floods or other major disasters that may limit the supply of raw materials that are purchased abroad for use in our international operations or domestically; - increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation and warehousing; - differing labor standards in the international markets in which we operate; - differing levels of protection of intellectual property across the international markets in which we operate; - difficulties and costs associated with complying with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to entities with overseas operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; - the threat that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation; - varying regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative practices in the international markets in which we operate; - difficulties associated with operating under a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations; and - potentially burdensome taxation.

Circumstances beyond our control, such as a labor dispute at a port or workforce disruption due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities. We have access to production outside of the United States through our facilities in Australia, Canada and China and joint ventures in Argentina and Europe, but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms.

Our level of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could: - make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt; - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes; 21 ----- - increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; - limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; or - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

In the United States, most of the potato crop used in value-added products is grown in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. European growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions, but the capital-intensive nature of our industry’s production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions. Unfavorable crop conditions in any one region, such as the drought in Europe during our fiscal year 2019, could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production.

Environmental and climate conditions, such as soil quality, moisture, and temperature, affect the quality of the potato crop on a year-to-year basis. As a result, we source potatoes from specific regions of the United States and specific countries abroad, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada, and China, where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist. However, severe weather conditions during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance, such as the drought in Europe during our fiscal year 2019. Potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure, decreased yields, and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes. We have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor the potato crop. However, if a weather or pest-related event occurs in a particular crop year, and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof, we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our customer opportunities, and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease. Alternatively, overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and over-supply.

The presence and/or formation of acrylamide in french fried potato products has become a global regulatory issue as both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‘‘FDA’’) and the European Food Safety Authority (‘‘EFSA’’) have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring compound. Acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give ‘‘browned foods’’ their desirable flavor. Acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet, including but not limited to breads, toast, cookies, coffee, crackers, potatoes, and olives. The regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control (temperature) and material testing (low sugar and low asparagine). However, limits for acrylamide content have been established for some food types in the State of California, and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits. In addition, the EFSA has recently promulgated regulations establishing specific mitigation measures, sampling and analysis procedures and benchmark levels for acrylamide in certain food products. If the global regulatory approach to acrylamide becomes more stringent and additional legal limits are established, our manufacturing costs could increase.

See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Description of Notes — Certain Covenants.’’ These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the notes. In addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreements that govern the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and NWFCS Credit Facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these ratios and tests. Our ability to continue to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments, including as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, permit the lenders thereunder to cease making loans to us.

While the relevant laws may vary from state to state, under such laws the issuance of the notes and the guarantees and the application of the proceeds therefrom will be a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance if (i) we issued the notes or any of the guarantors issued the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee, and, in the case of clause (ii) only, one of the following is true: - we or any of the guarantors were or was insolvent, or rendered insolvent, by reason of such transactions; - we or any of the guarantors were or was engaged in a business or transaction for which Lamb Weston’s or the applicable guarantor’s assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that it would, be unable to pay debts as they matured. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness 35 ----- of ours or of the applicable guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive any payment on the notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the governing law, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or any of the guarantors was insolvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that we or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities as they become due; or - it cannot pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court passing on a guarantor regarding any guarantee could conclude that such guarantee constituted a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, as a court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee if such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee. Specifically, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer laws. In addition, any payment by us under the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time that we or such guarantor were to be found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditor would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 36 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

As of February 23, 2020, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our total consolidated debt would have been approximately $3.5 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion would have been secured, and we would have had $0.1 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. A significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures. Therefore, our ability to service our debt, including the notes, is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries, joint ventures and minority investments and the distribution of those earnings to us, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these entities to us. The ability of these entities to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend upon their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing their debt. The Restricted Subsidiaries that guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will initially guarantee the notes. Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute or contribute, as the case may be, any of their assets to the Company or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, are structurally senior to the notes. As of February 23, 2020, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 19% of our total assets (8% of which is related to goodwill and intangible assets) and approximately 3% of our total liabilities. For the LTM period, these non-Guarantor subsidiaries contributed less than 10% of our net income. The indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Debt that we and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur. However, the amounts of this Debt could nevertheless be substantial.",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer for the notes following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer for the notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. We will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described above, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under this covenant by virtue of such compliance. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 30 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all the notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. The Change of Control repurchase feature is a result of negotiations between us and the initial purchasers. Management has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we would decide to do so in the future. Subject to the covenants described below, we could, in the future, enter into transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but that could increase the amount of Debt outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a phrase relating to the sale, transfer, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of our assets. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, if we dispose of less than all our assets by any of the means described above, the ability of a holder of notes to require us to repurchase its notes may be uncertain. In such a case, holders of the notes may not be able to resolve this uncertainty without resorting to legal action. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will restrict us in certain circumstances from purchasing any notes prior to maturity of the notes and also provide that the occurrence of some of the events that would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under that Debt. Future Debt of the Company, including any new Credit Facility, may contain prohibitions of certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require that future Debt be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by holders of notes of their right to require us to repurchase their notes could cause a default under existing or future Debt of the Company, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of that repurchase on us. Finally, our ability to pay cash to holders of notes upon a required repurchase may be limited by our financial resources at 52 ----- that time. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Our failure to purchase notes in connection with a Change of Control would result in a default under the indenture. Any such default would, in turn, constitute a default under our existing Debt, and may constitute a default under future Debt as well. Our obligation to make a Change of Control Offer as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified at any time prior to the occurrence of that Change of Control with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.

Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture that will govern the notes. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture that will govern the notes. Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. Neither we, the trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers, registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security for any reason, including to sell notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of the notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the indenture that will govern the notes. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes, DTC will exchange the applicable Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a ‘‘banking organization’’ within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC also 100 ----- facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC they are under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time.

Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

A foreign financial institution or such other foreign entity that does not comply with the FATCA reporting requirements generally will be subject to a 30% withholding tax with respect to any ‘‘withholdable payments’’ (whether such institution or entity is a beneficial owner or acting as intermediary). For this purpose, withholdable payments generally include U.S.-source payments otherwise subject to nonresident withholding tax (e.g., U.S.-source interest) and also include the entire gross proceeds from the sale of any debt of U.S. issuers, even if the payment would otherwise not be subject to U.S. nonresident withholding tax (e.g., because it is capital gain), unless (i) in the case of a ‘‘non-financial foreign entity,’’ such entity provides the applicable withholding agent with certain documentation relating to its substantial U.S. owners or otherwise certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners, (ii) in the case of a ‘‘foreign financial institution,’’ such institution enters into an agreement with the Department of Treasury to, among other things, report certain information regarding its accounts with or interests held by certain United States persons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by United States persons, withhold on certain payments to such persons and establishes its compliance with these rules by providing the applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other IRS Form W-8, as applicable (or an applicable successor form) or (iii) the ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ or ‘‘non-financial foreign entity’’ otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules and establishes such exemption by providing the applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other IRS Form W-8, as applicable (or an applicable successor form). However, the IRS issued proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations that eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds (but not on payments of interest). Pursuant to the preamble to the proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, any applicable withholding agent may (but is not required to) rely on this proposed change to FATCA withholding until final U.S. Treasury Regulations are issued. The rules relating to FATCA described above may be modified by an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the jurisdiction in which a holder is resident or organized. We will not pay any additional amounts in respect of any amounts withheld, including pursuant to FATCA. Under certain circumstances, refunds or credits of such taxes may be available.

The discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) rulings and pronouncements and judicial decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to differing interpretations and subject to change at any time. Any such change or differing interpretations may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the notes. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances (such as the effects of Section 451(b) of the Code conforming the timing of certain income accruals to financial statements) or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks and other financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, brokers, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings, partnerships or other pass-through entities or investors therein, regulated investment companies, personal holding companies, pension funds, real estate investment trusts, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, ‘‘controlled foreign corporations’’ or ‘‘passive foreign investment companies’’ (as such terms are defined in the Code), U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities and persons holding the notes as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to investors purchasing the notes for cash at original issue and at their issue price (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes are sold to investors for cash (excluding sales to bondhouses, brokers, or similar organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers)), and does not address subsequent purchasers of the notes. Moreover, the effect of any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, and any U.S. federal tax other than income tax, such as estate and gift tax, is not discussed. The discussion deals only with notes held as ‘‘capital assets’’ within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). As used herein, ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ means a beneficial owner of the notes that is or is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or - a trust, if a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more ‘‘United States persons,’’ as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996, and it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to continue to be treated as a United States person. If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners and partnerships should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax considerations of investing in the notes. No ruling from the IRS or opinion of counsel has or will be sought with respect to the matters discussed below.

If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.",N/A,as_expected,2020,127

Their audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of May 26, 2019 expresses their opinion that Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 26, 2019 because of the effect of a material weakness on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria and contains an explanatory paragraph that states there was an ineffective information technology general control (ITGC) in the area of application support team access to an information technology system (IT System) that supports process controls and information used in the Company’s financial reporting processes. As a result of this ITGC deficiency, automated controls that depend on the effective operation of the ITGCs and manual business process controls that are dependent upon the completeness and accuracy of information derived from the affected IT system were also considered ineffective. This control deficiency was a result of ineffective communication of internal control responsibilities that prevented the timely termination of temporary access to the IT System that was granted to certain authorized members of the Company’s application support team. 119 ----- # Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. ### $400,000,000 % Senior Notes due 2028 **8JUN201715242801** ## Goldman Sachs & Co.
