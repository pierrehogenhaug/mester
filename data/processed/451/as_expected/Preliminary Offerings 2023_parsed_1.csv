These forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to, all statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Offering Memorandum, including, without limitation, those regarding the Group’s intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, its future financial conditions and performance, results of operations and liquidity; its strategy, plans, objectives, prospects, growth, goals and targets; future developments in the markets in which it participates or is seeking to participate; and anticipated regulatory changes in the industry in which it operates. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “project,” “should” or “will” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. The Group cautions you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that its actual financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which it operates, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if its financial condition, results of ----- operations and cash flows, and the development of the industry in which it operates, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Factors that could cause such differences in actual results include: - the impact of complex governmental legislation and regulations; - growing competition in each of the Group’s markets or less profitable renewed PPAs; - the complexity of the rules of the SEM; - fluctuations in market prices and changes to renewable support mechanisms; - potential cyber-security failures of the Group or its service providers; - mechanical failure, equipment malfunction or technological breakdown; - loss or disclosure of personal or sensitive customer data; - decreases in demand for electricity; - government price interventions or reductions in governmental support for renewable energy sources in general or wind farms in particular; - UK’s exit from the EU; - variation from the estimations of the quantity of electricity actually produced from wind farms; - overall rise in interest rates and development risks related to the construction and development of new assets; - potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance; - an inability to be fully hedged against changes in commodity prices and market utilizations; - the Group’s hedging transactions may not function as intended; - counterparty risk to the Group’s engagement in hedging and risk management activities and the risk of market resettlement; - cost of compliance with energy efficiency initiatives, environmental laws and regulations; - environmental liabilities; - disruption to global capital and credit markets; - inability to raise capital on commercial terms or at all to expand the Group’s projects portfolio; - inability to maintain relationships with suppliers, regulatory authorities, customer advocacy groups or customers; - restriction or preventions of free business operation by government actions; - material health and safety liabilities; - failure to ensure climate resiliency; - significant reliance on Great Britain’s electricity and natural gas interconnectors; - necessity of substantial cash flow to maintain the Group’s assets and prevent failure; - inability to attract and retain key personnel; ----- - changes in legislation or policies related to tax applicable to the Group; - actions of the Group’s employees and agents; - other risks associated with the Notes and the financial profile and structure of the Group; or - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum. The foregoing factors and others described under “Risk Factors” should not be construed as exhaustive.

The Group discloses important factors that could cause its actual results to differ materially from its expectations in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results _of Operations.” Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely_ affect the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, the Group operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Group to predict all such risk factors. The Group cannot assess the impact of all risk factors on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Any forward-looking statements are only made as at the date of this Offering Memorandum and, except as required by law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which the Notes are listed, the Group undertakes no obligation to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

The market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used in this Offering Memorandum were obtained from governmental and other publicly available information and independent industry publications and reports prepared by industry consultants. In addition to the foregoing, certain information regarding markets, market size, market share, market position, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to us contained in this Offering Memorandum were based on estimates prepared by management based on certain assumptions and management’s knowledge of the industry in which the Group operates. Industry publications and forecasts generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. Management has not independently verified such data and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to validate market related analyses and estimates, requiring us to rely on the Group’s own internally developed estimates regarding the energy industry, the Group’s position in the industry, the Group’s market share and the market shares of various industry participants based on management’s experience, management’s own investigation of market conditions and management’s review of industry publications, including information made available to the public by the Group’s competitors. In this Offering Memorandum, market share of electricity and gas supply is expressed in terms of volume. Neither the Group nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you of the accuracy and completeness of, or take responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while management believes its internal estimates to be reasonable, these estimates have not been verified by any independent sources and neither the Group nor the Initial Purchasers can assure you as to their accuracy or the accuracy of the underlying assumptions used to estimate such data.

This Offering Memorandum includes the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for Fiscal Year 2023, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2021 which have each been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) (collectively the “Financial Statements”). The Financial Statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP (“Ernst & Young”), and their auditors’ reports thereon are included herein. The Issuer is a newly-incorporated special purpose finance subsidiary incorporated to facilitate the offering of the Notes and has no operations other than issuing the Notes. Consequently, no historical financial information relating to the Issuer is available. This Offering Memorandum also includes unaudited consolidated pro forma financial data which has been adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions and related transactions on the Group’s financial position and financial results as if the Transactions and related transactions had occurred on (i) March 31, 2023 for the purposes of the Group’s pro forma balance sheet data and (ii) April 1, 2022 for purposes of the Group’s pro forma income statement data. In addition, the unaudited consolidated pro forma financial data also reflect certain exclusions in relation to cash and indebtedness of the Group as at March 31, 2023, as further described under “Capitalization.” The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial data has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Group’s actual consolidated financial position would have been if the Transactions and such related transactions had actually occurred (i) on March 31, 2023 for the purposes of the Group’s balance sheet data or (ii) April 1, 2022 for purposes of the Group’s income statement data, nor does it purport to project the Group’s consolidated financial position at any future date or results of operation for any future period. The unaudited pro forma adjustments and the unaudited pro forma financial data set forth in this Offering Memorandum are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that the Group believes are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts. The independent auditors’ reports for the audited financial statements of the Group as at and for Fiscal Year 2023, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2021 are included in this Offering Memorandum. See “Independent _Auditors” for a description of the reports of the independent auditor of the Group, Ernst & Young, on the Group’s_ consolidated financial statements as at and for Fiscal Year 2023, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2021. In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent auditors’ reports of Ernst & Young state that they have been prepared for and only for the members of the Company as a body and for no other purpose; and the auditor does not accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom these reports are shown or into whose hands they may come. You should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditor confirmed that it does not accept or assume any liability to parties (including the Initial Purchasers and you) other than to the Company and its members as a body, with respect to such reports and to the independent auditors’ audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that you may have against the independent auditor based on its reports or the consolidated Financial Statements to which they relate could be limited.

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1255,NON-IFRS FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION,1255.1,,1255.1.1,,"The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum includes certain measures that are not accounting measures within the scope of IFRS, including Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries and cash conversion. Adjusted Operating Profit refers to operating profit before exceptional items and certain remeasurements, and adjusted for regulated entitlement, which reflects adjustments for over/under-recovery based on the amount by which the Group’s regulated businesses over or under recovered against their regulated entitlement. Adjusted EBITDA refers to Adjusted Operating Profit before deducting depreciation and amortization. Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA refers to Adjusted EBITDA after applying adjustments to eliminate the Adjusted EBITDA of the Group’s unrestricted subsidiaries under the Existing Notes Indenture and to include distributions paid to the Restricted Group from such unrestricted subsidiaries. Cash conversion represents Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA less Restricted Group capital expenditure, divided by Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA. We have included or excluded, as applicable, earning, debt, cash and other relevant metrics of the unrestricted subsidiaries in connection with the Existing Notes for illustrative purposes. This does not reflect the financial calculation under the Indenture for the Notes and it does not reflect all of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries in connection with the Notes. See “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other unaudited financial and ----- _pro forma data.” Management believes that Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group_ Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries and cash conversion are relevant measures for assessing the Group’s performance because they are adjusted for certain items which are non-recurring, which management believes are not indicative of the Group’s underlying operating performance or which do not reflect the performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which will be Restricted Subsidiaries under the Indenture. In addition, cash flow before interest and tax is a measure included in this Offering Memorandum which is not an accounting measure within the scope of IFRS. Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries, cash conversion and similar measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries and cash conversion as reported by us to Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries and cash conversion as reported by other companies. You should not consider Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries or cash conversion as alternatives to (a) operating profit from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of the Group’s operating performance, (b) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of its ability to meet its cash needs or (c) any other measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS. Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries and cash conversion have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for an analysis of the Group’s results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations for Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries and cash conversion are: - they do not reflect the Group’s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group’s working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments, on the Group’s debts; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA and Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, margins do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - some of the exceptional items that the Group eliminates in calculating Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA of unrestricted subsidiaries and cash conversion reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made. Because of these limitations, these non-IFRS measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the Group’s business or as measures of cash that will be available to meet the Group’s obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Group’s IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only supplementally to evaluate the Group’s performance. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments reflected in the Group’s presentation of the non-IFRS measures and whether you consider each to be appropriate.

Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column of a table may not exactly equal the total figure for that column.

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,Group activities and reporting segments,"_Renewables_ Renewable energy continues to be a key priority in NI and the RoI and both governments have set targets for increasing the proportion of electricity sourced from renewables. NI’s energy strategy targets the achievement of 80% renewable electricity by 2030 and the RoI Climate Action Plan also sets an 80% renewable electricity target by 2030. As at March 31, 2023, the Renewables segment owns and operates 309MW onshore wind generation assets across the RoI and NI, and has a pipeline of 49MW onshore wind generation assets under construction and 218MW of onshore wind generation assets in development. The Renewables segment also has a pipeline of 628MW of solar PV projects in development, and is currently commissioning a hydrogen electrolyzer onsite at ----- one of its NI onshore wind farms. In addition, the Group is also progressing the development of two offshore wind generation projects off the coast of Ireland totaling up to 1.8GW. The Renewables segment’s operational and inconstruction onshore wind generation assets are outside of the Restricted Group. Similarly, assets in relation to the pipeline of other wind projects and solar PV projects, are also owned by Unrestricted Subsidiaries and therefore outside of the Restricted Group. The Restricted Group received distribution from the unrestricted subsidiaries under the Existing Notes Indenture totaling €61.8 million during Fiscal Year 2023. The Renewables segment also purchases renewable electricity through PPAs covering 1,247MW of operating renewable capacity as at March 31, 2023. Energia Group was the first independent supplier to participate in the deregulated electricity market and an early mover on offering offtake contracts to third parties. Its first renewable PPA was signed in 2002. The Group estimates that it currently represents approximately 21% of the Irish market for Renewable Obligation Certificates (“ROCs”) and Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (“REFIT”) supported wind PPAs. The Renewables segment provides the Energia Group with further access to regulated renewable support mechanisms, with minimal capital requirements and potential upside to the extent of future increases in wholesale power prices, as well as positioning Energia and Power NI as ‘green’ suppliers and enhancing relationships and presence with key stakeholders within the sector. In addition, the Group has a entered into a REFA with Microsoft designed to meet a substantial proportion of their electricity demand in Ireland, whereby the output from the Renewables segment’s pipeline of in-development onshore wind projects (including the 49MW of renewable capacity currently under construction) and solar PV projects are expected to be supported by corporate PPAs with the technology company. Energia Group’s Renewables segment revenue for Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022 was €427.2 million and €401.9 million, respectively, and its Adjusted EBITDA during these periods was €224.5 million and €211.5 million, respectively. _Flexible Generation_ The Flexible Generation segment undertakes trading, regulation and asset management activities on behalf of the Group. This includes the day-to-day operation and commercial optimization of two CCGT plants (Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2) owned by the Group. The two Huntstown CCGTs are highly reliable, flexible and efficient plants, and their strategic location in the constrained Dublin area ensures at least one unit is running on most days of the year. Moreover, the Huntstown plants have the technical capacity to provide system-critical “Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System” (“DS3”) ancillary services, the importance of which has been increasing as the proportion of electricity generated by wind in Ireland has been growing. As at March 31, 2023, Huntstown has a total combined generation capacity of 747MW, which is able to supply approximately 10% of peak demand on an all-island basis (based on estimated peak demand of approximately 7,700MW). We believe that the two Huntstown CCGTs are critical to the security of electricity supply in the Dublin area. Under the Single Electricity Market (“SEM”), the Huntstown plants sell the generated energy into the Day-Ahead (“DAM”), Intra-Day (“IDM”) and Balancing Mechanism (“BM”) markets and sell capacity several years in advance via ‘Reliability Options’ as part of the Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (“CRM”). The Reliability Options have been awarded to the Group’s Huntstown plants for the current and next four capacity years, and include a clearing price of €83,050/MW for the capacity year 2026 to 2027. See also “Industry—The _All-Island Single Electricity Market—Energy Trading Arrangements—Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM).” Huntstown sells energy at the market clearing prices in the DAM and IDM as well as receive (or in some_ cases make) other payments for energy through constraint payments in the BM. The Huntstown plants also receive payments associated with DS3 ancillary services. The Group has also recently developed and commissioned a 50MW battery storage project in NI which is operated and traded by the Flexible Generation business. The project has been awarded a 10-year capacity contract commencing in the capacity year 2022/2023, at a clearing price of £78,600/MW for 8.15MW of its 11.3MW derated capacity. The Group plans to develop a further pipeline of battery storage projects, which we expect will strengthen the Group’s position for future capacity auctions and provide an additional source for ancillary revenue. The Group has also entered into a contract with EirGrid to provide 50MW of emergency gas generation located at the Huntstown site for a duration of three years, extendible by EirGrid to five years. Construction of this emergency gas generation project commenced in December 2022 and is planned to be completed by the end of 2023. ----- The Group is developing a 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin. The proposed data center has a grid connection offer and the lands necessary for the project have been acquired. Planning consent for the data center was received in April 2022 but the decision was appealed and the planning application is currently being considered by An Bord Pleanála, RoI’s national independent planning body. The Group expects _An Bord Pleanála to issue its decision in the near term and does not believe that there are grounds on which_ planning permission should be refused. The Group has entered into a contract with an international hyperscale technology company for a long term lease by it of the electrical infrastructure, buildings and integrated equipment at the data center. Capital expenditure in respect of the development of the data center was €20.0 million in Fiscal Year 2023 and €11.1 million in Fiscal Year 2022, primarily, in respect of land and development of electrical connections. Going forward, the Flexible Generation segment’s investment in the proposed data center in respect of the development of the data halls is expected to be an unrestricted investment and therefore outside of the Restricted Group. Investment in respect of the purchase of land, the design and build of all the high voltage electrical infrastructure (including a gas insulated substation and high voltage transformer switchyard) will be within the Restricted Group. The Flexible Generation segment also includes the Group’s PPB business which administers 600MW of contracted generation capacity from the Ballylumford power station in NI, which is subject to price control and entitles it to an allowance (effectively a management fee). This legacy PPB contract will expire in September 2023 in accordance with its terms. The PPB contract generated €14.6 million, €8.5 million and €9.3 million of EBITDA during the Fiscal Year 2023, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2021, respectively. For Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022, Flexible Generation generated €1,769.7 million and €989.5 million in revenue, respectively, and €204.7 million and €104.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, based on, or after taking into account the adjustments for over/under recovery against, the regulated entitlement of PPB. _Customer Solutions_ The Group’s Customer Solutions business operates under the Energia and Power NI brands. Energia Energia is a price control unregulated retail supply business, which supplies electricity and natural gas to residential and business customers in the RoI. Business customers include LEU and SME customers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Energia supplied electricity to 14% of the LEU market, 30% of the SME market and 12% of the residential market in the RoI in terms of consumption. As part of its hedging strategy, the Group’s Flexible Generation segment undertakes wholesale electricity, natural gas, carbon and green certificate trading activities on behalf of the Customer Solutions segment. Power NI Power NI is the incumbent electricity supplier in NI, supplying electricity primarily to residential customers. While the residential electricity supply market in NI is open to competition, Power NI remains the biggest supplier with a 55.0% market share of residential supply in terms of consumption during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. As a result, Power NI is still regarded as the dominant supplier and is therefore subject to price regulation. As a regulated business, Power NI is subject to price control which permits it to recover an allowance calculated by reference to its forecasted operating costs at the time of the relevant price control, plus an allowed margin based on a percentage of forecasted regulated revenue. On January 26, 2023, the UR confirmed the extension of the existing price control (which applies in respect to residential customers) to March 31, 2025. In addition, Power NI supplies electricity to business customers in the unregulated market and secures additional revenues through off-take from certain contracted smaller scale third party renewable generators (which are reported through the Renewables segment). In addition, the Customer Solutions business also offers energy efficiency services and car charging solutions to its customers across Ireland. For Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022, Customer Solutions generated €2,345.2 million and €1,780.1 million in revenue, respectively, and a loss of €162.1 million and €115.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, based on, or after taking into account the adjustments for over/under recovery against, the regulated entitlement of Power NI. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.2,,"The Group is a leading integrated Irish energy business active in both Republic of Ireland (“RoI”) and Northern Ireland (“NI”). The Group primarily operates through three business units: - Renewables; - Flexible Generation; and - Customer Solutions. The Renewables business owns and operates 309MW of onshore wind generation assets as at March 31, 2023, and purchases electricity from 1,247MW of renewable generation capacity across Ireland as at March 31, 2023, through off-take contracts (primarily, renewable Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”)). In line with the Group’s decarbonization strategy, the Renewables business has expanded in recent years and now has a substantial pipeline of additional onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (“PV”) development projects and has also entered into a renewable energy framework agreement (“REFA”) with Microsoft, which is designed to meet a substantial proportion of their electricity demand in Ireland. The Renewables business is also currently commissioning a hydrogen electrolyzer onsite at one of its NI onshore wind farms and is progressing the development of two offshore wind generation projects off the coast of Ireland totaling up to 1.8GW. The Flexible Generation business owns and operates 747MW of conventional gas-fired generation assets in the RoI and procures power under contract with 600MW of conventional generation assets in NI, in each case, as at March 31, 2023. In addition, under the Flexible Generation business, the Group is currently undertaking the following key initiatives: - 50MW battery storage project in NI, which has been recently commissioned; - 50MW emergency gas generation project under a contract with EirGrid that is currently under construction and is planned to be commissioned by the end of 2023; and - a 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin, which is currently under development. The Customer Solutions business supplies electricity or gas to a total of 828,300 customer sites across Ireland, comprising 311,700 customer sites in the RoI and 516,600 customer sites in NI, as at March 31, 2023, through its two retail brands, Energia and Power NI. With a digitally-enabled customer-centric focus, the business also offers energy efficiency services and car charging solutions to its customers across Ireland.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive strengths,9.2.1,"Vertically integrated energy business with growing, predictable and resilient cash flows","Energia Group is a leading vertically integrated energy business active in the energy market across NI and the RoI. The Group enjoys strong strategic positioning in each of its business segments, with revenue generation in each underpinned by one or more of: regulatory support, pro-renewable energy policies, a contracted nature, or a comparative/structural advantage. In particular, Energia Group’s EBITDA is supported by strong regulatory underpinnings. For instance, REFIT supported PPAs in the RoI provide a floor on price per unit of electricity sold, and eligible renewable generators such as our Group receive ROCs for each MWh of electricity generated and consumed within NI (or used in a permitted way), which are freely tradable at auctions and can be sold to suppliers throughout the UK. Furthermore, Power NI Energy is subject to regulated price controls in respect of its residential customer base and its current price control runs to March 31, 2025. Additional factors that should further underpin the Group’s earning resilience include, a long-term lease arrangement with an international hyperscale technology company in respect of the proposed 165MW data center at the Group’s Huntstown campus, corporate PPAs through the REFA with Microsoft, which is expected to support the pipeline of 218MW of onshore wind projects in development and the five-year hydrogen gas purchase agreement with Translink. The Group has a strong track record of resilience through turbulent market conditions. In particular, the Group demonstrated resilient performance through the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and despite their impact on the commodity environment, the Group’s EBITDA has continued to grow such that the Group’s Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA (excluding distribution from Unrestricted Subsidiaries) for Fiscal Year 2021, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2023, was €150.2 million, €121.0 million and €177.6 million, respectively. We believe that our sustained EBITDA growth is driven by our high-quality asset bases, the Group’s vertically integrated business model and credit enhancing investments. Moreover, Energia Group’s vertically integrated structure (comprising supply activities as well as both renewable and thermal electricity generation) provides a natural hedge against volatility in wholesale electricity prices to the extent that the dispatch of the Huntstown plants and the generation of the renewable generation portfolio offsets exposure to retail supply contracts sold. For example, the annual average of electricity purchased for supply by the Energia Group from Fiscal Year 2021 to Fiscal Year 2023 was 6.1TWh, and the annual average of electricity generated and sold by the Energia Group during the same period was 6.2TWh.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive strengths,9.2.2,Strategically positioned to benefit from attractive market fundamentals reflecting our focus on energy transition and sustainability,"The Group also expects to benefit from strong growth and demand. Strong growth in demand for energy is expected across Ireland, particularly driven by population growth, development of data centers in the Dublin region and the electrification of heat and transport across Ireland (Source: Ireland Capacity Outlook). In particular, the Irish system continues to face a potential supply deficit, with capacity shortfall particularly prevalent in Dublin given rapid growth in large energy users and Dublin’s electricity system remains constrained in the medium-term. We believe that given its strategic positioning in each of its business segments, the Group is well positioned to benefit from these market factors in the Irish Market. The island of Ireland enjoys some of the best wind resources in Europe. Renewable energy continues to be a key priority in NI and the RoI and both governments have each set targets for increasing the proportion of electricity sourced from renewables. NI targets achieving 80% renewable electricity by 2030 and the RoI Climate Action Plan also sets an 80% renewable electricity target by 2030. In addition, NI has adopted a “Path to Net Zero Energy” policy, which aims at 48% reduction in net CO2 emissions by 2030 (as compared to 1990). In light of these policies, the governments in Ireland support investment in renewable sources and which in turn strongly supports the Energia Group expansion in the renewables sector in Ireland. In addition, we believe our continued endeavors in renewable energy development will effectively align with and address the stronger investor demand and expectations surrounding ESG commitments.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive strengths,9.2.3,Extensive Renewables assets and PPA portfolio complemented by system-critical Flexible Generation,"In light of the NI and RoI governments’ targets, and in line with its own strategy to build on and diversify its platform of renewable assets to accelerate low carbon growth and increase earnings, Energia Group, through its Renewables segment, has successfully built-out its onshore wind farm portfolio. Its operational owned onshore wind farm capacity has increased from 9MW as at March 31, 2014 to 309MW as at March 31, 2023. The Group currently has 49MW of onshore wind farm capacity under construction supported by a corporate PPA and a further ----- pipeline of 218MW of onshore wind projects in development which are expected to be supported by corporate PPAs with Microsoft. In addition, the Group has a strong presence in the renewables market as a PPA provider to third party wind farms, with 1.2GW of capacity contracted as at March 31, 2023. The Group is a leading developer and operator of renewable energy across the island of Ireland and supplies 21% of renewable electricity in Ireland through 15 onshore operational and wholly-owned wind farms Huntstown 1 and 2 are flexible CCGT plants, benefiting from high efficiency and low CO2 emissions, as well as a strategic location on the outskirts of Dublin. Dublin and the surrounding area represents the highest concentration of customer demand in Ireland, which is expected to grow significantly in the coming years in the context of general economic growth as well as the significant expansion in data center capacity that is projected for the Dublin region (Source: Ireland Capacity Outlook). The Dublin area is also presently characterized by a high level of electricity system constraints. Such system constraints include, for example, voltage control, in which generation is required in a particular area of the electrical system to support local voltage, or load flow control, in which generation is required to enable the efficient flow of electricity. Energia Group’s plants are critical to the security of energy supply and system stability in Dublin and the surrounding area due to existing electricity system constraints, and as such receive energy payments not only based on market clearing prices set on the basis of an “unconstrained” (“in merit”) dispatch (i.e. in a theoretical world where no restrictions or physical limitations on dispatching such electricity exist), but also constraint payments, designed to compensate the plants when they get dispatched “out of merit.” Energia Group’s CCGTs are frequently dispatched “out of merit,” and at any time, at least one of the plants is typically running either ‘in merit’ or on a “constrained” basis to ensure system stability. See “Industry—Generation—Network infrastructure, _constraints and curtailment.”_ The Huntstown plants also receive capacity payments under Reliability Options acquired through the Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (“CRM”). The CRM was established by the regulatory authorities as part of the SEM design to provide an incentive to generators to invest in building and maintaining generation capacity. Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 are modern CCGT plants, which the Group believes are among the most reliable conventional plants in Ireland, as evidenced by their high availability levels since being commissioned, with both plants achieving lifetime availability levels of approximately 92%. The Group believes that Huntstown 1 and 2 will continue to benefit from revenues under the CRM due to the overall need for capacity in the SEM and Huntstown plants system-critical role in alleviating the localized constraints in the Dublin area. As at March 31, 2023, both Huntstown plants have secured Reliability Options under CRM auctions for each capacity year to September 30, 2027, being the latest year for which Reliability Options have yet been awarded. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors affecting _results of operations—Capacity and availability.”_ In addition, as flexible and responsive generators, Huntstown 1 and 2 receive certain payments in return for the provision to the system operator of ancillary services necessary for the secure operation of the electricity system. We believe that these services (including operating reserve, reactive power, replacement reserve, synchronous inertial reserve, fast frequency response, ramping margins and fast post-fault active power recovery) are becoming particularly important as the proportion of electricity generated from wind increases in the Irish energy market, with some models suggesting more than 14GW of wind generation capacity to be connected to the grid by 2030 as part of the RoI and NI governments’ endeavors to meet their renewable targets (Source: Ireland Capacity Outlook). Wind is an intermittent and non-synchronous technology, and power demand on the island varies throughout both the day and the year, giving rise to transmission system supply and frequency imbalances. Energia Group’s CCGTs have the technical capability to provide ancillary services under DS3, meaning they are well-positioned to benefit from system service payments.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive strengths,9.2.4,Digitally enabled Customer Solutions business supporting the energy transition,"Energia Group has strong market positions in electricity and natural gas supply across Ireland. In NI, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Power NI remained the biggest residential electricity supplier and had a 55.0% market share in terms of consumption, in a market where the total consumption was 2.855TWh (Source: QREMM Reports). In the NI business supply market, where the total consumption was 4.639TWh, Power NI was the third largest supplier with a market share of 26.0% by consumption for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (Source: QREMM Reports). Although the market share of Power NI across all customer classes has fallen since market liberalization, its EBITDA contribution has remained stable, underpinned by the form of Power NI’s current price control, which runs to March 31, 2025, and fixes 70% of its regulated allowance with the remainder variable based on customer ----- numbers, thus limiting the impact of customer attrition on Power NI’s results. The Group believes that Power NI is well-positioned for the future, irrespective of the continuation of its regulated status, as its efficient operations, strong brand awareness and excellent customer service represent significant competitive advantages vis-à-vis other players in the market. While the NI residential supply market has been open to competition since 2007, when Power NI held 100% of the market, Power NI has been able to maintain its competitive advantages and retain strong market share. Power NI generates further revenues through its strong presence in the deregulated business customer segment of the market and through certain smaller scale contracted renewable PPAs. In the RoI, where the total consumption in the business electricity and gas markets was 19.801TWh and 13.987TWh, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Energia had 14.0% and 30.0% market shares, by volume of the LEU and SME business electricity supply segments, respectively, and 14.0% and 13.2% shares of the LEU and SME natural gas supply segments, respectively, making Energia the second largest electricity and fourth largest gas supplier to business customers by volume (Source: Energy and Water Monitoring Report). Energia has a diversified customer base, with a particular focus on single and multi-site SMEs, which we believe represents the most profitable market segment. Energia entered the RoI residential supply market in January 2014. Leveraging the low cost-to-serve billing and customer service platform of Power NI, Energia now serves 280,832 residential sites as at December 31, 2021, including single fuel (electricity or gas) and dual-fuel (electricity and gas) customers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Energia held a 12% share of the RoI residential electricity market and 11% share of the residential gas supply market, where the total consumption was 9.381TWh and 7.723TWh, respectively (Source: Energy and Water Monitoring Report). Digitalization remains a priority and the Group continues to progress its development of innovative, enhanced and differentiated product offerings to customers. Accordingly, the Group has invested in the development of a ‘digital IQ’ platform to allow customers greater access and transparency, thereby accelerating the shift to zero carbon. From advanced billing to smart EV charging, the ‘digital IQ’ platform will empower the Group to provide a more efficient and personalized service to its customers.

Restricted Group capital expenditure excludes capital expenditure on the Group’s data center and offshore wind strategic projects and includes deferred income received in relation to the emergency generation project. Over the last three Fiscal Years, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA has averaged €178.9 million, the Restricted Group capital expenditure has averaged €32.5 million. This strong performance has historically also benefitted from diligent and timely management of baddebt levels in the Customer Solutions businesses. This was achieved through proactive credit management, including a focus on creditworthiness at the time of customer acquisition, and the use of prepayment meters and direct debit plans. For Fiscal Year 2023, approximately 35.4% of Power NI’s customers paid using prepayment meters and direct debit payment plans covered approximately 92.0% and a further 39.0% of Energia’s and Power NI’s customers, respectively. In addition, the Customer Solutions business further mitigates the effect of customers defaulting by using credit insurance in respect of certain customers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive strengths,9.2.6,Credit enhancing investment opportunities,"We believe that the Group offers a favorable investment opportunity underpinned by credit enhancing data center and renewable investment initiatives. ----- The Group’s proposed 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin will benefit from a twentyyear lease term contract with the end user, which is an international hyperscale technology company. The technology company has leased the electrical infrastructure, buildings and integrated equipment (the powered shell) from the Group and has the option to further extend the lease by two five-year periods. The data center is strategically located, adjoining the existing Huntstown power station campus, which enables the Group to maximize profitability from auto producer benefits by co-locating power generation and electricity consumption at the same site. In addition, the end user would pre-fund the construction of the first two phases of the data center and payment from the Group to the end user would be due only at completion. Going forward, the development and construction of the data halls is expected to be financed pursuant to ring-fenced project finance arrangements, entered into by Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and hence outside of the Restricted Group. Consistent with the Group’s decarbonization strategy, the Group has a strong pipeline of renewable projects, including 218MW of onshore wind generation assets and 628MW of solar PV assets in development, 49MW of onshore wind farm capacity under construction, two offshore wind generation projects off the coast of Ireland totaling up to 1.8GW, and a REFA with Microsoft, which is designed to meet a substantial proportion of their electricity demand in Ireland. The Group’s renewable projects are developed pursuant to ring-fenced project finance arrangements, entered into by Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and hence outside of the Restricted Group.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive strengths,9.2.7,Highly experienced management team with proven ability to deliver against targets,"The collective industry knowledge and leadership of the Group’s management team combined with their record of accomplishment in responding to economic conditions and evolving market dynamics are key assets to the business. Under the leadership of its management team, the Group has grown substantially, increasing EBITDA generation by more than €140 million since fiscal year 2017, establishing one of the largest renewable energy businesses in the RoI and NI and being an early mover in innovative new energy-efficient technologies, such as battery storage and green hydrogen. The Group’s management team has a proven track record of consistently delivering superior performance and successfully completing growth strategy projects, such as the build-out of the Group’s owned wind portfolio, including the securing of dedicated, commercially favorable project financing with an aggregate €288.5 million of indebtedness outstanding under project finance bank loan facilities as at March 31, 2023, for these ring-fenced assets. The members of the management team have an average of 23 years of experience with the Group and an average of 25 years of experience in the energy industry and have won numerous awards in the energy sector. The Group believes that the team is highly regarded throughout the industry, has excellent relationships with regulators and government departments, maintains active representation on several electricity and gas industry organizations in Ireland, enhancing insight into and influence on ongoing market consultations, and has been directly involved in the strategic development of the energy markets in which the Group operates. We believe our management plays a pivotal role in Ireland’s ongoing energy transition. The Group also benefits from its ownership by I Squared Capital, an investor focusing on infrastructure, including the energy, utility and digital infrastructure sectors. I Squared Capital has extensive experience and expertise in developing and operating energy and utility businesses across the globe and provides the Group with management experience and technical support. I Squared Capital is committed to implementing sustainable operational improvements through optimization of cost structures and providing management teams with the flexibility to prudently manage cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.1,Support the decarbonization of the energy system in Ireland,"The Energia Group is committed to reducing the carbon intensity of its electricity generation by 50% to 165 gCO2/kWh by 2030 compared to Fiscal Year 2020 levels. The transition to a low carbon economy presents opportunities and the Group continues to implement its Positive Energy investment programme across a range of major renewable energy projects including onshore and offshore wind farms, solar PV power, hydrogen fuel generation and the smart grid. The Positive Energy investment programme is aligned with the Government of RoI’s commitment to increase the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources to 80% by 2030 and will contribute to further sustainability in Ireland’s energy supply and to the achievement of Ireland’s climate change reduction targets. The Group’s commitment to target a 50% reduction in the carbon intensity of its electricity generation by 2030 compared to Fiscal Year 2020 levels is expected to be achieved through a number of measures including the delivery of its Positive Energy investment programme.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.2,Improve profitability and maintain stable cash flows,"The Group seeks to capture available margin and cash flows arising in all parts of the value chain in the Group’s business, both regulated and unregulated. The Group intends to continue to ensure high cash conversion through the consistent delivery of earnings and the ongoing management of maintenance capital expenditure with the average cash conversion over the three years from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2023 at 80.8% (Fiscal Year 2021: 86.7%, Fiscal Year 2022: 70.6%, Fiscal Year 2023: 85.2%). The Group has renegotiated the original maintenance contracts for the Huntstown plants so that the associated costs are largely variable in relation to operating hours. This allows the majority of LTSA maintenance costs to be recovered as a marginal cost of generation in the Irish electricity market. Furthermore, the Group plans to extend its track record of synergistic deployment of resources across its businesses. For example, the Group benefits from operational synergies between gas and renewable generation, using engineering and management expertise from the established conventional generation business to oversee operations and maintenance in the growing renewable asset portfolio. This has enhanced performance in a costeffective manner. Within the Customer Solutions business, the Group leveraged Power NI’s billing system and mass market operational expertise in the residential retail market when planning and executing Energia’s entry into the competitive RoI residential supply market, resulting in a low-cost market entry and competitive cost to serve. Finally, the Group optimizes its naturally hedged position arising from its vertically integrated structure. Within the Energia Group, management intends to continue to optimize its wholesale portfolio and its complementary positions in supply and generation to ensure stability of earnings and improve profitability. For example, Energia’s gas customer base allows the cost of gas capacity purchased on the gas transmission network to be optimized with the Huntstown plants, making Energia’s customer offerings more cost competitive.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.3,Support the predictability of the Group’s earnings through the diversity of contracted and structurally supported revenue streams,"The Group aims to continue delivering excellent performance against price controls for Power NI for the mutual benefit of the regulated businesses and customers. Having delivered a current operational portfolio of 309MW of renewable onshore wind generation, the Group also expects to complete the delivery of additional windfarm projects (with 49MW of onshore wind capacity currently in construction and a further 218MW of onshore wind capacity in development). While the current operational portfolio avails itself of valuable government-backed support mechanisms, such as ROCs and REFIT, which are provided to renewable energy generators, the projects going forward are expected to be supported by corporate PPAs with Microsoft. The Group expects to maintain high availability levels for the system critical Huntstown CCGT plants located on the outskirts of Dublin. The plants both have low minimum stable generation levels thereby giving a wide operational range. The Group believes that their location, their high availability, reliability, and their low minimum generation levels increase the attractiveness of the Huntstown plants to the Transmission System Operator (“TSO”), allowing it to use the plants to accommodate a broad range of variability in wind generation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.4,"Deliver integrated energy margin, enhance product offerings and look for opportunities to diversify Customer Solutions’ customer bases","Energia Group seeks to sustain a robust and profitable market share through the entrenched position of its Customer Solutions’ businesses. The Group aims to continue to deliver the integrated energy margin from its customer base and focus on customer retention through technological advances with enhanced and differentiated product offerings while looking for opportunities to increase, diversify and enhance the quality of its customer relationships. This is intended to allow the Group to compete other than on price alone, thus aiming to preserve Group margins. The Group offers additional products and services to residential customers, beyond core electricity and gas supply, in the areas of energy efficiency, boiler maintenance and smart home products, which help differentiate the Group’s offerings and, the Group believes, brings value and convenience to customers. The Group offers energy efficiency consulting services to business customers throughout Ireland and operates a dedicated key account management service for large consumption customers and a sales agent channel for smaller customers. The Group supports and is actively participating in the smart meter roll out in the RoI and the development of “smart services” which integrates smart meters with digital controls over home energy systems such as solar PV, battery storage, electric vehicle (“EV”) charging and heating control. In NI, the Group supplied 47.3% of overall residential prepayment meter customers as at December 31, 2022 and offers a range of online billing and consumption monitoring services tailored to meet customer requirements. Furthermore, for customers who have installed micro-renewables, such as solar PV panels, on their own premises, the Group provides access to the market. The Group continues to focus on maintaining its high-quality customer service proposition to improve efficiency and foster continued and increased customer loyalty. The Group has invested in the development of a ‘digital IQ’ platform (the Group’s software as a service platform) to allow customers greater access and transparency, thereby accelerating the shift to zero carbon. From advanced billing to smart EV charging, the ‘digital IQ’ platform will empower the Group to provide a more efficient and personalized service to its customers. This real-time cloud platform helps to reduce costs, boosting customer engagement and enabling decarbonization through smart, low carbon energy technologies. The Group will continue its focus on maintaining a low level of customer debt compared to industry peers. This has been achieved through a thorough debt management process, including debt checking potential customers and by using prepayment meters as a debt management tool.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategy,9.3.5,Build upon the Energia Group platform to realize complementary growth opportunities accretive to earnings,"Management’s continued focus on consistently achieving a high conversion rate of earnings to cash both enables the Group to maintain a prudent capital structure and underpins the potential to capitalize on growth opportunities which are value enhancing through earnings accretion, enhancing the business risk profile, and/or which are otherwise complementary to current operations in supply and generation. Two such areas of opportunity for near-term growth are the expansion of renewables and the development of the Group’s data center at the Huntstown campus in Dublin. _Continue to drive growth through expansion in renewables_ Government targets continue to support Energia Group’s expansion in the renewables sector in Ireland and facilitate the Group’s objective to achieve a balanced and sustainable generation mix and play a leading role in the decarbonization of the energy system across the island of Ireland. The Group aims to increase the volume of renewable electricity generated by it to three times the current levels by 2030. This offers the opportunity to further diversify the Group’s asset base with investments backed by contracted, government-backed renewable support mechanisms or corporate PPAs. The Group has a proven renewable energy development and operational platform, with 309MW of owned onshore wind generation capacity, 49MW under construction and 218MW in development and a pipeline of 628MW of solar PV projects in development, in each case as at March 31, 2023. The Group is well-positioned to take advantage of further medium-term growth opportunities in Irish renewables. These may include strategic acquisitions of development projects, facilitated by our strong presence in the market as a PPA provider with 1.2GW of capacity contracted as at March 31, 2023, as well as by the Group’s relationships with developers and its track record of successfully bringing projects into operation. ----- Furthermore, the Group intends to pursue the development of offshore wind generation capacity in order to further diversify its platform of renewable assets to accelerate low carbon growth and increase earnings. Given the scale of offshore projects and the offshore development, construction and operations experience required to participate in the Marine Area Consent application and/or ORESS2, the Group is exploring the potential to codevelop, through a joint venture, the North Celtic Sea (“NCS”) and South Irish Sea (“SIS”) offshore wind projects, or alternative sites that may be identified. _Drive growth through the Group’s strategically located data center_ EirGrid forecasts a significant growth in energy demand by 2031 from data centers in the Dublin region and the Group is at an advanced stage of development of a strategically located hyperscale 165MW data center at the Huntstown campus in Dublin. The proposed data center has a grid connection offer and the lands necessary for the project have been acquired. Planning consent for the data center was received in April 2022 but the decision was appealed and the planning application is currently being considered by _An Bord Pleanála, RoI’s national independent planning body. The Group expects An Bord Pleanála to issue its decision in the near term and does not believe that there are grounds on which planning permission should be refused. The Group has entered into a contract with an international hyperscale technology company for a long term lease of the powered shell which typically covers electrical infrastructure, buildings and integrated equipment, but with the interior left as raw space to be finished by the tenant at the data center.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.1,"Our businesses are subject to complex governmental legislation and regulations that have affected, and may in the future affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.","We operate in a highly regulated environment and our businesses are subject to a wide range of complex governmental legislation and regulation, including those overseen by regulatory bodies in the RoI, the UK and the EU, including the UR and the DfE in NI, the CRU and the DECC in the RoI, as well as the SEM Committee (the decision-making authority for the SEM which comprises representatives from the CRU and UR in addition to an independent and deputy independent member) on an all-island basis. Regulation impacts numerous aspects of our business and industry including, but not limited to, overall market structure and design, construction and operation of generation facilities, acquisitions, disposals, recovery of costs and investments, return on Power NI’s and PPB’s regulated business activities, market behavior rules, support mechanisms for renewable generation, present or prospective wholesale and retail competition and environmental matters. We are also subject to general competition rules and pro-competition government policies. In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the EU and the UK have imposed comprehensive trade restrictions on Russia as well as significantly expanded the existing sanctions against individuals and entities. Furthermore, as a direct response to the energy crisis and in order to enhance protection for domestic electricity and gas customers in the RoI, the RoI Government introduced a moratorium on disconnections for the 2022-2023 winter period. The moratorium on disconnections was one of a number of measures in place to protect domestic customers who engage with their suppliers regarding the management of debt and a further review of customer protection measures that are in place with suppliers and will be undertaken by the RoI Government before the 2023-2024 winter period. These rules, policies and trade restrictions have affected, may continue to affect or have the potential to affect the operation of our business and any changes to such rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to applicable public procurement laws, including the EU Utilities Directive. Changes in, revisions to, or reinterpretations of existing or pending laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our businesses. Further, our ability to take actions and implement new policies may be constrained by government regulations. As a result of the third EU energy package, the Clean Energy for all Europeans package and EU regional integration initiatives in the electricity and natural gas sectors, regulators are required to monitor the level and effectiveness of the opening of markets and the development of competition in the supply of electricity and natural gas to final customers. This requires suppliers, including us, to provide additional information to regulators relating to retail business activity, including contractual and tariff information, level of customer switching to alternative utility providers, customer debt and payment plans, disconnection levels, customer complaints, and retail margins. This level of increased transparency may result in regulators taking actions that have an adverse effect on our retail businesses. Suppliers may also be required to include the end date of customer contracts on their bills, provide customers with clear prompts when contracts are coming to an end, notify customers of the benefits of switching suppliers, and provide customers with estimated annual bills. These may require changes to our IT systems. Suppliers are also subject to additional compliance requirements related to safe-guarding customer information, implemented through regulator-approved customer charters and codes of practice. Failure to comply with these additional consumer protection measures could result in sanctions or revocation of our supply licenses. The rules to which we are subject, and the licenses under which we operate, are complex and subject to interpretation. In the event our interpretation is inconsistent with one taken by the relevant regulatory authority, we could lose certain benefits, or be required to reallocate certain revenues and expenses across our regulated and ----- unregulated businesses. Changes in regulation may also require us to invest in maintenance or other improvements to our generation facilities or result in costs of operation no longer being recoverable in the market. Any such expenditures could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, we may be subject to, or requested to participate in, regulatory inquiries, reviews, or investigations from time to time. There can be no guarantee that the findings of such inquiries, reviews, or investigations will not result in regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our development assets are subject to planning consent and licensing regimes in the jurisdictions in which they are located, which are constantly subject to change and in the case of offshore wind projects in some instances still evolving. There can be no assurance that any or all of the planning permissions and licensing regimes our assets are subject to will not become more restrictive in the future or that we will be successful in meeting or complying with these requirements. For instance, planning consent for the proposed data center at our Huntstown campus in Dublin, RoI, was received in April 2022 but the decision was appealed and the planning application is currently being considered by An Bord Pleanála, RoI’s national independent planning body. The Group expects An Bord Pleanála to issue its decision in the near term and does not believe that there are grounds on which planning permission should be refused. However, there can be no assurance that such consents will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our operating assets are subject to planning compliance conditions such as noise and shadow flicker, which are reliant on third party technology and which is not guaranteed to meet the compliance levels, as well as environmental requirements, which may also be dependent on third party landowners cooperation and compliance with contractual arrangements. Such arrangements cannot be guaranteed over a project lifetime, and therefore, there can be no assurance that the Group complies, or will continue to comply, with any of these conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, while we benefit from regulatory price controls in relation to Power NI and PPB, these price controls are subject to regulatory intervention, which could reduce the prices that Power NI is able to charge for the supply of electricity to customers in regulated categories in NI, even if its costs increase or remain the same, and can therefore negatively affect our results. A reduction in prices or regulated entitlement as a result of changes to the price controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.2,"We face growing competition in each of our markets, which could lead to a loss of customers, reduced margins, an adverse effect on our retail strategy or reduction in profitability on renewal of PPAs.","We face growing competition in the electricity and natural gas supply markets in which we operate from both established market participants and new market entrants that could adversely affect our market share in both the residential and business sectors. Our principal competitors in NI business electricity supply markets are SSE Airtricity, Electric Ireland and Go Power. The main competitors in the residential market are SSE Airtricity, Electric Ireland, Budget Energy and Click Energy. New competitors may enter either one or both of the business electricity supply or residential electricity supply markets in the near to medium term. The form of Power NI’s current price control, which runs to March 31, 2025, ensures 70% of its regulated allowance is fixed, with the remainder variable based on customer numbers, which has the effect of limiting the impact of customer attrition on Power NI’s results. While such a provision remains in place, nevertheless, the impact of competition by new entrants or an increase in capacity of existing market participants may, in the longer term, have a material adverse effect on Power NI’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In the RoI’s competitive retail electricity and natural gas markets, our principal competitors are the local incumbent utilities, Electric Ireland and BGE, which have the advantage of long-standing relationships with their customers. Our other competitors include SSE Airtricity, Pinergy, Panda Power and PrePay Power. It is also possible that substantial new entrants from outside Ireland may enter the energy market, further increasing competition in our market. Furthermore, the Group supports and is actively participating in the Government’s smart meter roll out in the RoI and is committed to the development of “smart services” which integrate smart meters with digital controls over home energy systems such as solar PV, battery storage, EV charging and heating control. However, there is a risk that the Group may not be able to develop the products and tariffs to satisfy customers’ demand for “smart services” and therefore may, in the longer term, have a material adverse effect on Customer Solutions’ business, financial condition and results of operations. In both the RoI and NI markets, certain of our competitors or potential competitors may be larger or better capitalized than us or they may be government-owned, as is currently the case with Electric Ireland. These competitors may be able to offer lower prices or other incentives that may attract customers away from us, thereby reducing our market share, which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition ----- and results of operations. Furthermore, when electricity prices increased significantly as a result of the energy crisis and high commodity prices, there was a reduction in the levels of churn of customers to other suppliers. As commodity prices have stabilized since early 2023, it remains to be seen what the medium to longer-term impact is on customer churn. Our results may be adversely affected if we have to give further discounts to customers or increase our operational costs to reduce the churn of customers to other supply companies. The Group has a 1.2GW portfolio of contracted PPA capacity as at March 31, 2023, the majority of which is underpinned by government-backed renewable support mechanisms. When originally entered into the NIRO, PPAs were typically for a 20-year term and the REFIT PPAs were for 15 years. Some of the Group’s older PPAs have expired and a number of other PPAs will expire in the years ahead. The Group will therefore be required to negotiate renewal terms with generators ahead of the expiry of PPAs in order to agree on commercial terms for the renewal of the contractual agreement between those renewable generators and the Customer Solutions businesses. The Group faces competition from other suppliers in the market as well as corporate PPA offtakers, which could result in commercial terms not being agreed with generators or the achievement of commercial terms which are significantly less favorable or profitable for the Customer Solutions businesses, and therefore this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.3,The rules of the Single Electricity Market are complex and could adversely affect our revenues and/or undermine the long-term viability of our power generation assets and therefore adversely impact our results of operations.,"The rules of the SEM, which came into effect on May 23, 2018, are complex and affect the major revenue streams of all generators, thermal and renewable, who sell into the market. While freely bidding into the ex-ante physical energy markets in the SEM, the Huntstown plants can be required to generate to relieve constraints, placing them in the balancing market. Participation in this market is mandatory; moreover, maximum bids they can offer for balancing actions are regulated. The SEM rules contain prescriptive and detailed costing rules defining which elements are considered to fall within allowable “short run marginal costs,” placing restrictions on the costs the Huntstown plants may take into account when setting their bids in the balancing market. This could preclude the recovery of legitimate short run marginal costs associated with running the plants. The capacity remuneration mechanism operates through capacity auctions, open to owners of physical generation assets and other providers of capacity, that award Reliability Options to successful bidders at the market clearing price. A Reliability Option is a one-way contract for difference, entered into between a generator and a central agency, that incentivizes a generator to generate electricity at times of market spikes in exchange for a fixed payment, while foregoing incremental revenue (by means of a ‘difference payment’) when the market price is above a defined strike price. The capacity remuneration mechanism also includes the possibility that Reliability Options may be awarded on an elevated pay-as-bid basis within certain constrained network areas, or that a targeted contracting mechanism could be used to provide sufficient income to support continued operation of system-critical generation capacity required to ensure security of supply (which may require State aid clearance). The maximum bid that may be submitted by an existing generator in the capacity auction is limited, by rule, to half the estimated net cost of new entry of a new dispatchable power plant, unless a higher unit specific price cap is applied for and granted to a generator. For the CY 2027/28 T-4 capacity auction, the existing capacity price cap is €54,586/MW/year, although the granting of unit specific price caps could potentially increase this figure if any plants receive such caps. As a result of the competitive auction process, the Group faces uncertainty with respect to the pricing and remuneration of its capacity. For example: - Due to the amount of generation capacity across the island of Ireland, generators might offer very low prices per MW of contracted capacity, in an effort to win Reliability Options at the auction. Depending on the number of bidders and the prices they offer, our Huntstown plants may not win Reliability Options at auction or may win Reliability Options only at unattractive prices. Alternatively, we may attempt to bid our Huntstown plant, which operates in the constrained Dublin area system, at its maximum allowable bid (which would be the existing capacity price cap of €54,586/MW/year, unless we were granted a higher unit specific price cap) on the expectation that we would receive a Reliability Option and be paid at our bid price, notwithstanding our high bid, due to the limited availability of alternative generation capacity within the constrained Dublin area system. However, there can be no assurance that we would win a Reliability Option under those circumstances, or that the Dublin-area constraints will not eventually be alleviated through the construction of new infrastructure, which would reduce our ability to win Reliability Options when bidding at the cap; ----- - The requirement of a generator to make difference payments under a Reliability Option during price spikes, which could be triggered by administered scarcity pricing, would result in a generator holding a Reliability Option suffering negative cash flow, which could only be offset if that same generator was selling power into the market at the prevailing elevated spot price. If we win Reliability Options in respect of our generation capacity, we run the risk that if we fail to operate at our contracted capacity during spot market price spikes, we will not receive elevated market revenue to offset the cost of the difference payment we would be required to make. While there are certain ‘stop loss’ limits in case of outages, even relatively short outages during periods of price spikes could result in net negative cash flows in respect of the Reliability Option awarded to us; - Some capacity auctions are scheduled up to four years ahead of the Reliability Option period and with such a delay we bear the risk that, even if we bid the maximum allowable price, our plant costs may change in the intervening period, rendering our bids uneconomical and resulting in losses if we were to win a Reliability Option and be required to deliver such capacity. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the maximum value of a bid is set by the regulators based on an assessment of market conditions at the time of bidding. To the extent that we place a successful bid in the capacity auction at below cost and do not receive sufficient additional revenues from other sources, we may operate at a loss; - In 2018, the Group secured four-year local reserve service agreements (“LRSAs”) for both of the Huntstown plants, which expired on September 30, 2022. The LRSAs ensured that the Huntstown plants continued to be available to meet security of supply in the Dublin area whilst providing sufficient remuneration to the plants for services provided in the SEM market. Although the LRSAs have since expired, there could be a potential risk that the award of those contracts is subject to challenge or the European Commission’s decision to approve State aid for the Irish capacity market could be subject to challenge; - In future years there can be no guarantee that the SEM Committee will maintain the existing capacity price cap at the current level set of €54,586/MW/year for the CY 2027/28 T-4 capacity auction. As a result, we could receive prices that do not cover the fixed costs of the Huntstown plants; - The Irish Capacity Remuneration Mechanism received State aid approval from the European Commission in November 2017 for a period of 10 years starting from the day the reformed SEM market entered into force, which was October 1, 2018. This means that capacity auctions can continue to take place up to October 2028 under the current State aid approval. The continuation of capacity auctions beyond October 2028 is subject to renewed State aid approval. Should the Huntstown plants not be adequately remunerated in SEM, it may not be economically viable for either or both of them to continue to operate. The RoI Grid Code purports to require a generator that wishes to cease to operate to give three years’ notice of such intention. If the Huntstown plants were required to operate for three years in such circumstances, it could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations and financial performance. Where a generator cannot comply with a provision of the Grid Code it may apply for a derogation from the relevant requirement. If the CRU considers that the grounds for the derogation are reasonable, then the CRU shall grant such derogation unless the derogation would, or it is likely that it would, have a materially adverse impact on the security and stability of the transmission system or impose unreasonable costs on the operation of the transmission system or on other users. Given that the Huntstown plants are frequently constrained on to provide system critical support in the Dublin region, there is a risk that the CRU may seek to enforce the purported notice requirement and/or seek to deny a derogation and if the CRU were able to sustain such a position the Huntstown plants would be required to continue to operate. In the event that the Huntstown plants ceased to operate (whether having been required to fulfil the three year’s notice or otherwise) we would incur the loss of the revenues associated with the operation of the Huntstown plants and any costs arising from ceasing to generate and may sustain reputational damage from ceasing to operate system-critical plant. If any of these risks were to materialize, our revenues may be reduced and/or additional costs incurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.4,"Fluctuations in market prices of electricity, changes to renewable support mechanisms and the availability of generators may adversely affect our wind farm generation and PPA results.","Our profitability and potential growth is influenced by the prices we receive for the electricity we generate. The Renewables business in the RoI is supported by the REFIT regime, which protects us from downside market price fluctuations below the REFIT base price level. Above this level, revenues are dependent on wholesale ----- electricity prices and are subject to volatility. Volatility in electricity prices, which can be impacted by commodity prices for coal, oil, natural gas and carbon, and, in particular, a drop in the prices for such traditional energy fuels, may cause electricity generated from wind power to achieve a lower than anticipated market price for electricity and adversely affect our business. Throughout Fiscal Year 2022, the commodity markets for gas and carbon experienced sustained periods of volatility and increasing prices, which resulted in higher market prices for electricity. Geopolitical circumstances caused further volatility in the wholesale commodity markets in Fiscal Year 2023, resulting in periods of higher market prices for electricity. Customer demand and the amount of energy generation on the system, including the amount of wind, can also impact market prices. A sustained reduction of market prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “—Government _price interventions and/or reductions in governmental support for renewable energy sources in general, or wind farms in particular, may adversely affect our operations.”_ Our Renewables businesses in NI benefit from the Renewables Obligation (“RO”) regime and attract ROC revenues and revenues from wholesale electricity prices, as described above for the RoI (see also “Business—Group activities and reporting segments—Renewables”). The Renewables business obtains income from ROCs, through both direct bilateral sales in auctions with suppliers who require additional ROCs to meet their obligations and through obtaining its portion of the recycled buyout fund payment, which Ofgem distributes each year to electricity suppliers in respect of the ROCs held by them. The value of the buyout fund payment is based on the aggregate buyout payments Ofgem receives from electricity suppliers who did not meet their RO obligations in the relevant compliance period. However, the Renewables business cannot know in advance or control the prices or the payment they will receive each year. A material downward fluctuation in the market prices of electricity and ROCs, or the size of the recycled buyout fund may have an adverse effect on our financial results. Furthermore, any changes to the existing RO regime in the UK or the implementation of a new support in NI to replace the existing NIRO support could have a negative impact on the value of ROCs in NI, including those we hold from time to time. See “—Government price interventions and/or reductions in governmental support for _renewable energy sources in general, or wind farms in particular, may adversely affect our operations.”_ In addition, parties to our PPA agreements and the Group’s own wind farms may experience reduced electricity generation revenues as a result of generator faults, gear box rebuilds, grid availability issues or other mechanical failures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events and may include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (e.g., through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or exfiltrating sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recent geopolitical tensions may have increased the risk and scale of deliberate cyber-attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing. There is a risk that the Group may be unable to protect itself from a nation-state cyber-attack due to their advanced cyber capabilities. Substantial costs or regulatory fines may be incurred by the Group in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Group has implemented information security management measures in light of its operations, industry, and associated risks, as well as established disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans in the event of, and cyber-security risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyber-attacks will go undetected. For instance, as a precautionary measure, we have in the past temporarily suspended the use of third-party supplier systems for suspected cyber-security incidents. However, there has been no material adverse effect on our systems as a result of such suspensions. Furthermore, the Group cannot control the cyber-security plans and systems put in place by its service providers. The Group could be negatively impacted as a result. Cyber-security failures of, or breaches of, the Group’s systems and other service providers’ systems have the ability to cause disruptions, impact business operations and could result in significant costs, including ----- investigation and remediation expenses, regulatory scrutiny, legal liability and the loss of personal or sensitive information, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.6,"Mechanical failure, equipment malfunction or technological breakdown could adversely affect our business and operating results.","The successful operation of our business depends upon maintaining the integrity of our key systems and equipment, such as the Huntstown plants, our portfolio of wind farm assets, trading systems, our hydrogen generation and battery storage assets, and our integrated IT systems. Our systems and equipment are vulnerable to mechanical failure, equipment malfunction, technological breakdowns or other interruptions from events, certain of which are beyond our control, including: - fire, flood and other natural disasters; - adverse weather conditions; - trips in the electricity grid, in particular to the extent that these are not compensated through the SEM; - failure of the natural gas transportation network; - mechanical, technology or electrical failures; - telecommunications or data network failures; or - unauthorized physical or electronic access, including cyber-attacks. Systems or equipment failures could also affect or damage our facilities and our electricity production capacity could be materially adversely impacted as a result. It could also take longer than expected to repair damaged facilities due to delays in the supply chains, many of which are international, used by the Group. While we maintain standard business interruption insurance for our wind farm assets and the Huntstown plants and have disaster recovery plans and prevention policies in place, any damage or interruption (for example, an unexpected outage at the Huntstown plants leading to a service interruption) could cause a significant disruption to our operations. From time to time, we experience technical issues at our plants, including faults resulting in outages, incidents requiring urgent repairs or involving significant costs and breakdowns that cause unexpected interruptions. Even though business interruption insurance is in place, the Group could potentially be exposed to a greater than necessary financial impact in the event that the cause of the interruption is not covered under the policy or that the rectification of the cause of the interruption is delayed, e.g. due to supply chain issues, beyond the business interruption period covered under the policy. An IT disaster recovery plan is in place (which is essentially linked to physical damage/defects), which covers the whole Group. Centrally coordinated business continuity plans are in place covering the various locations where each business operates and office-based staff have the capability to work from home securely. However, despite such disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans being in place, there remains the risk of significant unexpected interruption to the Group’s business operations through unavailability of systems in the event of malicious cyber-attack on the Group’s information technology (“IT”) systems or its outsourced service providers’ IT systems or employee negligence. There can be no assurance that there will be no interruptions to the availability of our assets, specifically, the Huntsown CCGT. For instance, on January 29, 2021, a fault was identified on the Huntstown 2 main generator transformer, which resulted in the plant not being available to the market. While we suffered losses as a result of such interruption, they were largely covered by our business interruption insurance; however, such insurance cannot be guaranteed for any future outages or interruptions. A new replacement transformer was successfully installed and commissioned and the plant returned to service on October 23, 2021. The new replacement transformer was procured from a new supplier with whom the Group had no previous relationship. Although diligence was undertaken on the supplier’s credentials and workmanship, the Group does not have first-hand experience of the operation of similar transformers and therefore there could be a risk that other unexpected interruptions occur in the future and/or that maintenance and repair costs or times are greater than expected. For the Huntstown CCGTs, while we seek to manage the risk of any interruption or breakdown by having long-term maintenance agreements in place with the plants’ original equipment manufacturers and operating the plants to the manufacturers’ approved operation, maintenance and safety policies and procedures, they may experience breakdown or interruptions for an extended period of time and there can be no assurance that we will be able to ----- recover for our losses in the event of such an interruption of breakdown under our insurance policies, including our business interruption insurance policies. The connection offer, providing for firm import capacity for the Huntstown data center, contains obligations on Huntstown Power Company Limited to maintain ongoing availability of Huntstown 1. Any material reduction in availability could result, under certain circumstances, in the loss of firm import capacity and ultimately could lead to a termination event under the lease with the tenant of the data center. In the event that we are forced to shut down any of our sites for a significant period of time as a result of mechanical failure, equipment malfunction, cyber-attack, technological breakdowns or other interruption, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Furthermore, the projected increase in demand for electricity may not materialize.","The future profitability and growth of our businesses are partially reliant upon a projected increase in the demand for electricity in the Irish market that may not occur in the manner we anticipate. This projected increase is dependent on a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, weather conditions and residential consumption, which are inherently unpredictable and difficult to forecast accurately. Moreover, the historic correlation between economic growth and demand for electricity that we generate may not hold true in the future. Furthermore, in light of the energy crisis and the climate change agenda, the governments in both the RoI and NI are targeting a reduction in energy consumption. The use of subsidies and support measures, for instance retrofit solar PV and energy efficiency measures, could lead to a reduction in the demand for electricity. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our revenue will grow in line with expectations, which are based, in part, on the projected increase in demand for electricity in the SEM and this, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

For several years, the EU, the RoI and NI have adopted governmental policies and subsidies actively supporting renewable energy. A number of the Group’s renewable assets are supported by financial support schemes that have now closed, such as the NI Renewable Obligation (“NIRO”) regime and the RoI REFIT schemes. Unlike newer support schemes that are typically designed on the basis of a two-way mechanism providing both a ceiling and floor to investor returns (such as the RoI RESS scheme), the NIRO and REFIT schemes provide only a floor. During periods of high wholesale market prices, the fact that renewable generators can at times earn significant market revenue without any commensurate increase in input costs, as is the case for thermal units, has caused governments in Ireland and ----- the UK to introduce measures aimed at limiting what has been interpreted as surplus revenues. In the RoI and NI, there could be a risk that longer term changes are made to existing support schemes that place a ceiling on the potential revenue a supported generator can earn, i.e. REFIT and NIRO. _NI_ The 2022 Autumn Statement announced by the UK Chancellor, unveiled the Electricity Generator Levy, a new temporary 45% charge on exceptional receipts generated from the production of wholesale electricity, applicable to all electricity generators across the UK and thus including renewable generators in NI. Exceptional receipts are defined as wholesale electricity sold at an average price in excess of £75 per MWh over an accounting period. The levy will be limited to generators whose in-scope generation output of electricity exceeds 50GWh across a period of a year. The levy will only apply to exceptional receipts exceeding £10 million in an accounting period. Some generators within the scope of the levy have seen certain costs increase in line with the wholesale price of electricity. This is often in the form of fuel costs or revenue-sharing agreements with third parties. The levy will allow for the deduction of a limited set of exceptional costs when calculating generators’ liability. Generators that operate under the contracts for difference support scheme, investment contracts or in receipt of feed-in tariff export payments are excluded from the levy. The levy is in effect from January 1, 2023 until March 31, 2028, and applies to pro-rated profits for accounting periods between those dates. The levy brings the headline rate of tax to 70% on such receipts and the legislation is being introduced to enact the levy. Until such time that this is enacted, it is not possible to conclusively determine the financial impact on the Group’s operations from the introduction of the levy. The NIRO regime is designed to incentivize the generation of electricity from renewable sources and places an obligation on suppliers to source a portion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the NIRO regime, eligible renewable generators receive ROCs for each MWh of electricity generated and consumed within NI or used in a permitted way. ROCs are freely tradable at auction and can be sold to suppliers throughout the UK in order to fulfil their obligations under the relevant Renewable Obligation regime. From 2027, it is proposed that fixed-price certificates will be issued, in place of ROCs, to projects qualifying for ROC support until the end of the RO regime in 2037. It is currently proposed that fixed-price certificates will be set at the 2027 buyout price plus 10% and will be inflation-linked. In August 2015, DETI confirmed that the fixed-price certificate scheme will be introduced for the NIRO in 2027, however, a consultation on the detailed design of the fixed-price certificate scheme and the associated legislation has not yet been issued. DfE are consulting on the implementation of a new support scheme for NI, expected to be in the form of a contract for differences (“CfD”). A proposal within the consultation is to replace existing ROC support with a CfD contract as a means of placing a ceiling on renewable generators’ potential returns and therefore there is a risk that the final design of the support scheme for NI from 2027 could have a material adverse effect on the Renewables business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to utilize ROCs depends on their timely issuance by Ofgem. In the event they are not issued on a timely basis, we may be unable to utilize them within the time periods we intend, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows or our wind farm project finance arrangements. Furthermore, our ability to utilize ROCs depends on our ability to demonstrate that the wind power we generate in NI is actually consumed by our own customer base. While our wind power generation is off-taken by our supply business for customers in NI, wind power generation and customer demand can each fluctuate substantially over short term timescales. Accordingly, there is some risk that there may be a mismatch between the wind power we generate and consumption by our customer base. _Republic of Ireland_ The European Commission has set a revenue cap on all electricity generators across Europe, requiring them to hand over to national governments, in accordance with EU rules, any excess revenue they receive for selling their non-gas generated power at over €180/MWh. The Irish Government has decided to implement the cap at a lower price of €120/MWh for both wind and solar PV generators. In line with the EU guidance the cap has been in place since December 1, 2022 and is expected to expire by June 30, 2023. While a recent European Commission consultation on the future design of the electricity market stopped short of extending the cap, the EU is keeping the matter under review. A risk remains therefore that the cap could be extended. The detailed methodology by which the cap will be implemented in RoI has yet to be published. Until such time that the final methodology is published, it is not possible to conclusively determine the financial impact on the Group’s operations from the introduction of the cap. ----- The RoI REFIT regime reimburses suppliers for the out-of-market costs associated with their purchase of renewable energy. The reimbursements are paid from PSO Levies collected from end users and allow suppliers to offer fixed price PPAs to generators of renewable electricity. The REFIT mechanism in the RoI relies upon a comparison between actual annual market prices received by suppliers for selling power into SEM and the revenue floor guaranteed by the relevant REFIT Scheme in respect of the relevant renewable technology. Any shortfall in revenue is recovered by reimbursements paid out of the PSO levies. Recent high market prices have resulted in no requirement to make top up payments from the PSO levy to generators. There is a risk that in the future a requirement to make such top up payments may arise and that there may be a delay in receiving such payments. The RoI or UK governments may choose to reduce or eliminate subsidies for the renewable energy sector or may delay the implementation of legislation or other efforts geared towards developing this sector. Should high wholesale prices occur for a sustained period, there could be increasing pressure for the introduction of a mechanism by which electricity market revenues can be limited for generators receiving PSO support. There is also a risk that should the EU decide not to implement a further revenue cap, the Irish Government might seek to review the terms of the REFIT scheme in an effort to curb surplus revenue accrual by its participants. The reduction or abandonment of governmental support for renewable energy sources in general, or for wind power in particular, or the introduction of further market interventions, could render the renewable energy sector significantly less profitable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There is also a risk that electricity market reform at an EU level (such as the EU Commission’s current proposal for a reform of the EU Electricity Market Design announced on March 14, 2023) could threaten the existing marginal cost pricing model whereby the most expensive generators needed to meet demand (e.g. gas fired generators) set the price paid to all generators, including those with lower marginal cost (e.g. renewables). Whilst the European Commission is not proposing any change to the pricing mechanism based on marginal pricing, there is an appetite within some Member States for fundamental reform to prevent high gas prices from setting high electricity prices in future. Such reforms, if implemented, could render the renewable energy sector significantly less profitable and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Notwithstanding the wider EU-UK TCA, the NI Protocol, agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, also came into force on January 1, 2021 to ensure that there would be no new checks on goods crossing the border between NI and the RoI. As a result of the protocol, NI has in effect remained in the EU’s Single Market for goods, while England, Scotland and Wales have left the EU’s Single Market for goods. The NI Protocol also protects the continued operation of the SEM market, however, the framework for electricity trading across interconnectors between Ireland and Great Britain has changed and these two interconnectors are no longer able to participate in the EU single day-ahead market. The NI Protocol contains a consent mechanism to retain the provisions under which NI applies EU single market regulations and the EU customs code. The NI Assembly’s first vote on the NI Protocol is to take place before the end of 2024. The Withdrawal Agreement states that the NI Protocol will cease to apply if consent is sought, a decision is reached, and the UK notifies the EU that the decision is not in favor of continued application of the NI Protocol. This suggests that if consent is never sought and a decision is never made because the NI institutions are not functional, the default is that the NI Protocol will continue to apply. Due to significant disagreements surrounding the NI Protocol, the UK and EU entered into negotiations to amend it. These negotiations concluded with the announcement of the “Windsor Framework” on February 28, 2023. The Windsor Framework is made up of a number of documents including a UK Government Command Paper, a joint UK-EU political declaration, draft decisions to be taken by the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee and unilateral measures to be adopted by each party respectively. On March 24, 2023, it was ratified by the UK and the EU. Post-Brexit uncertainty and unpredictability concerning the UK’s legal, political and economic relationship with the EU could be a source of instability in the UK economy and international markets, and it may create significant currency fluctuations and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross border cooperation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise) for the foreseeable future. A portion of our business is conducted in NI, which is a part of the UK. Should there be a future material adverse effect on the UK economy, such an event could negatively affect demand for our products and services in NI. Also, revenues from our businesses in NI are collected in pound sterling, and a decline in the value of the pound sterling against other currencies used in the international energy, commodity, and equipment markets (such ----- as the euro and U.S. dollar) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance. It is also possible that Brexit could lead other EU member states to consider leaving the EU, which could be an additional source of instability in international markets. Further, other EU member states within the eurozone could decide to discontinue their use of the euro as their functional currency. The exit of another country from the EU, the potential secession of Scotland, Wales or NI from the UK, or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to any of these possibilities, could result in significant macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited to, decreases in global stock exchange indices, increased foreign exchange volatility (in particular a further weakening of the pound sterling and euro against other leading currencies), and decreased GDP in the European Union. Given the RoI’s proximity to the UK and its strong trade, investment and finance links with the UK, the longer-term impact of Brexit could damage RoI trade and the RoI economy in the years ahead. In turn, an economic downturn could also negatively affect demand for our products and services in the RoI. Also, revenues from the Group’s businesses in the RoI are recognized and collected in euros, and a decline in the value of the euro against other currencies used in the international energy, commodity, and equipment markets (such as the U.S. dollar) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial performance. In the event of Scottish independence and in the lead up to such an event, a considerable amount of uncertainty in the Irish energy markets could arise, as it is unknown if a newly independent Scotland would reaccede to the EU, and what the terms of the relationships would be between an independent Scotland and her neighbors. Great Britain and Ireland’s electricity and gas grids are linked via several interconnectors, some of which run through Scotland, and the vast majority of Ireland’s gas consumption is supplied via a Scottish interconnector. If Scotland votes to secede from the UK, nearly all of the British North Sea oil fields, half of its natural gas fields, along with its accompanying highly important transit infrastructure would fall under Scottish control. See “—We rely on electricity and natural gas interconnectors with Great Britain to meet our electricity _and natural gas requirements.”_ Any of these risks and also potentially unforeseen related risks concerning Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Estimates of output are based on various assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, including weather conditions. The quantity of electricity actually produced by the Group’s owned and contracted wind farms, or the quantity of electricity generated therefrom in the future, may vary materially from our estimates. Under SEM, the unpredictability of wind farm generation could lead to costs under Reliability Options, if such wind farms take part, or the need to turn to the balancing market during periods of unexpected generation shortfall. Subsequent evaluations of actual production output and the performance of our owned wind farms, as well as the third-party wind farms in respect of which the Group has PPAs, based upon production data or other information, may result in material revisions to our original output estimates. Any significant negative variance in the quantity of electricity produced by our owned wind farms, or procured through our PPAs, or a change in the proportion of wind energy that can be captured and utilized by such wind farms or their ability to convert wind energy to electricity, could adversely affect the Renewables business’ revenue and the profitability of our renewables assets, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, from time to time, the wind farms on the network may produce more renewable power than can be accommodated on the all-island power system. In the event TSO deems it necessary to retain certain types of power stations on the network for technical reasons, such as to ensure adequate maintenance of the system frequency, it may undertake curtailment actions, which may include instructions to one or more renewable generators to reduce the export of power to the network in favor of a generator with different characteristics. Even when there is no network-wide surplus of renewable power, limitations may apply to a geographically defined subset of the transmission network, which may be caused by such factors as the current carrying capacity of a local transmission network, the requirement to maintain local voltage profiles, or the requirement to remain within switchgear ratings. It is expected that Dublin will continue to be highly constrained in the period to 2030. The TSO must manage local generation and supply within these constraint limits, which ----- may result in the TSO instructing a renewable generator connected to a constrained part of the system to reduce its export of power to the network. While curtailments and constraints have historically taken place from time to time, the increasing prevalence of wind power in the Irish network gives rise to the risk that such actions may become more frequent. Significant investment in the electricity grid and interconnection to facilitate wider and deeper electrification powered by renewable electricity is fundamental to the long-term decarbonization of the island of Ireland. The decisions taken by the TSO imposing constraints and curtailment on our wind farms and PPAs directly impact upon the revenue and profitability of those wind farm assets and PPAs, and if the scale of these actions were to increase it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The Group is currently constructing one onshore wind farm and an emergency gas generation plant and plans to undertake construction of further projects in the future. Any construction delay, change in government policy, issues with securing permissions from local landowners or need to obtain planning amendments could result in delays to the estimated commencement date for commercial operations and increased costs or could render a project uneconomic. Our projects must obtain connections to the electricity grid, however there are significant demands for connections from the system operators, EirGrid and SONI, made by ourselves and other developers, which could result in significant delays in securing the connections we need. The process of obtaining grid connections may also be costly and timeconsuming, as we must, among other requirements, obtain planning and other consents from relevant authorities, secure any required easements or wayleaves from landowners and construct the physical connection between the generation asset and the power grid. In addition, the post-COVID-19 recovery and global supply chain shortages have the potential to disrupt the availability of contractors, equipment, and supplies, which could cause delays to construction of assets. For instance, planning consent for the proposed data center at our Huntstown campus in Dublin, RoI, was received in April 2022 but the decision was appealed, and the planning application is currently being considered by An Bord Pleanála, RoI’s national independent planning body. The Group expects An Bord _Pleanála to issue its decision in the near term and does not believe that there are grounds on which planning_ permission should be refused. While there is no further mechanism for appeal on planning grounds against the decision of An Bord Pleanála, a sufficiently interested party could obtain leave from the court to apply for judicial review of the lawfulness of the decision by An Bord Pleanála. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such planning consents will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. The capacity capable of being contracted under the REFA is subject to a number of conditions, including the timely achievement of certain related planning, consenting and development requirements and requires that a threshold volume achieves first export by December 31, 2024. In the event that Microsoft are not obliged to offer a project a CPPA under the REFA and no CPPA is otherwise agreed with Microsoft, the Group is likely to be free to pursue alternative routes to market such as RESS or through CPPAs with other parties. In the event that certain of the Group’s renewable development projects are not supported by CPPAs entered into under the REFA or are unsuccessful in achieving an alternative route to market they may not be capable of being constructed and operated economically. Any failure to obtain the necessary consents or access rights, or delays in establishing the connection between the generation asset and the grid (or achieving compliance with relevant grid code tests), or construction delays in general, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, where the Group enters into PPAs in respect of in-development third-party wind farms, such thirdparty wind farms face similar development, grid connection and construction risks that could lead to delays in the commencement of commercial operations. Any delays in the development of onshore and offshore wind, solar PV, emergency gas generation, battery storage and data center projects, or their cancellation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In response to increased levels of inflation in major economies around the world, central banks, such as the European Central Bank, the U.S. Federal ----- Reserve and the Bank of England, raised interest rates or have signaled that they will or may raise interest rates in the future. For instance, in December 2021, the Bank of England voted to increase the base rate to 0.25% in the first increase since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and since then, has steadily increased the base rate through 2022, and most recently in June 2023, to 5.00%. Similarly, the European Central Bank raised its benchmark deposit rate, on multiple occasions throughout 2022, and most recently in June 2023, to 3.50%. Continued increase in interest rates could affect our ability to finance the development of new projects by debt capital and the general ability to refinance debt that becomes due. In particular, to the extent we use external debt financing at partially variable interest rates or when refinancing existing fixed rate indebtedness, an increase in interest rates would directly result in higher financing costs for us, including through higher costs for funding capital expenditure requirements, requiring further cash outflow for our business. To control our interest rate risk we may enter into hedging contracts in respect of a portion of our interest rate exposure. However, if any counterparty to these hedging contracts is unable to meet its obligations or if our hedging procedures turn out to be ineffective for other reasons, the interest expenses incurred by us could be higher than expected.

Our policies cover product and public liability, property damage, business interruption, employer’s liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, and credit risk insurance. However, these insurance policies may not cover any losses or damages resulting from the materialization of all of the risks to which we are subject. For example, like other power companies, we are not insured for the risk of viruses attacking our operational IT systems. Furthermore, in the event we suffer a loss in relation to an insured risk, there is no guarantee that the amount of insurance protection to which we are entitled will be sufficient to cover the entire loss incurred. Insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover all or any lost revenues or increased costs of working/expenses from business interruptions or other events, including the cost of replacement electricity. It could also take longer than expected to repair damaged facilities due to delays in the supply chains, many of which are international, used by the Group. Even though business interruption insurance is in place, the Group could potentially be exposed to a negative financial impact in the event that the cause of the interruption is not covered under the policy or that the rectification of the cause of the interruption is delayed, e.g. due to supply chain issues, beyond the business interruption period covered under the policy. Furthermore, our ability to obtain insurance, and the cost of and coverage provided by such insurance, could be affected by adverse events, some of which may be outside our control. Our future inability to obtain important insurance policies at all, or on commercially acceptable terms, could have an adverse impact on our business.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.15,Our assets or positions are not and cannot be fully hedged against fluctuations in commodity prices and market utilizations and our revenues and margins may be impacted and hedging transactions may not function as intended.,"Volatility in market prices for electricity and natural gas may result from a variety of factors, including severe or unexpected weather conditions, changes in electricity and fuel usage, geopolitical events, availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, and changes to energy, environmental and other regulation and legislation. We do not and cannot fully hedge the risks associated with changes in electricity, natural gas and CO2 prices or generation plant utilizations or our relative size in the market. To the extent we have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices and inaccuracies in forecasting electricity market prices can materially affect our results of operations and financial condition, either favorably or unfavorably. Energia Group’s own thermal generation has historically acted as a hedge against price spikes or other circumstances that require increased capacity in the SEM, for example when other generators are experiencing outages. However, as the proportion of renewable generation increases, the effectiveness of the Huntstown plants as a hedge decreases. The Group’s hedging activities are carried out by its trading team, which has developed a range of sophisticated retail-related products to reduce our exposure to movements in commodity prices, including financial and physical natural gas contracts, financial and physical power contracts, interconnector capacity purchases and CO2 and foreign exchange trades (these being the primary drivers of variable generation costs in the SEM). Specifically, the Customer Solutions businesses employ commodity swaps to hedge a large proportion of their exposure to natural gas prices and forward purchase contracts to hedge CO2 emission costs, while PPB hedges its exposure to commodity price fluctuations with respect to its generation contracts through the use of commodity swaps and forward purchase contracts. Further, the Customer Solutions businesses and PPB enter into ----- CfDs to hedge their exposure to electricity market price volatility; however, for a variety of reasons, including a lack of liquidity in the CfD market, it may not be possible to enter into forward purchases at commercially acceptable terms, or the business may decide not to enter into such hedges at all, for any or all of our electricity requirements. This necessitates the use of hedges based on the underlying drivers of electricity generation costs, but these hedges do not provide a perfect hedge to electricity prices, which are also influenced by, among other things, weather, demand, the fuel mix in the power generation markets (including the relative cost of natural gas compared to coal), and plant availabilities, reducing the effectiveness of this risk mitigation strategy. The price we can obtain for electricity sales from our customers may not change at the same rate as changes in input costs, thereby potentially restricting the margins realized on these sales and reducing our revenue. Volatility in the foreign exchange market may also affect the price of inputs and, consequently, our costs and earnings. Although we have in place risk management procedures, we attempt to reduce our exposure to price volatility and to achieve margin certainty, and we regularly review how our procedures are implemented in practice, we may not eliminate all the risks associated with our activities. As a result of these and other factors, we cannot predict the impact that hedging and other risk management actions may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations and hedging policies.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.16,"We are exposed to counterparty risk, where we engage in hedging and risk management activities, and the risk of market resettlement.","Where we engage in hedging and risk management activities, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties owing us money or obligated to supply us with energy or other commodities as a result of market transactions will not perform their obligations. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be required to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor the underlying commitment at thencurrent market prices. In the event of counterparty failure, it may not be possible to find an alternative counterparty willing to step in and provide alternative hedging arrangements. In the event of either having to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices, we may incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the initial counterparties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, reductions in our credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect our liquidity and financial condition. We are reliant on credit lines being made available from our commodity counterparties. The Group employs commodity swaps to hedge gas price exposures and Great Britain power price exposures as well as forward purchase contracts to hedge its shortfall of CO2 emissions allowances and is therefore reliant on credit lines being made available from a limited number of commodity counterparties. In periods of price volatility there could be a risk that commodity counterparties limit or reduce the Group’s ability to place further trades due to their exposure to ‘out of the money’ fair value of the derivative financial instruments. Should such restrictions be imposed, the Group may be required to either find alternative commodity counterparties or cash collateralize current counterparties in order to place further trades. While trading restrictions would not be expected to endure long-term, in the event that commodity counterparties closed or reduced their credit lines, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Participants in the markets in which we operate are also exposed to the risk that another market participant may default on its obligations to pay the SEMO for electricity taken, in which case such costs, to the extent not offset by posted security and other protections available to the SEMO (which is designed to be a fully collateralized market) may be shared across the various non-defaulting SEM market participants, including us. While any such exposure is not expected to be significant, in the event required payments are larger than anticipated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the SEM trading arrangements, which comprise a DAM, IDM and BM, have experienced volatility since the market commenced on October 1, 2018 and the Group’s businesses remain exposed to energy price and volume resettlement risks. As at March 31, 2023 the market operator has resettled these markets up to December 3, 2022 for M+4 resettlement and March 5, 2022 for M+13 resettlement (the market is ordinarily resettled 4 months and 13 months after initial settlement). However, some system defects remain and further market fixes are required to be implemented. The Group is therefore exposed to potential price and volume resettlements in the balancing market ranging the full 54-month period from the commencement of the new market ----- arrangements and therefore has estimated the level of resettlement that will be applied. These estimates are based on known market anomalies as extensively discussed in industry forums and facts and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. Estimations are dependent on the resettlement approach taken by the market operator. While any such exposure is not expected to be significant, in the event that actual resettlement amounts are larger than anticipated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities, and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur, including potentially costly regulatory and enforcement developments related to carbon reduction or other greenhouse gas emissions or any other sustainability or climate resilience issues. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or operation of our facilities could be forcibly stopped, curtailed or modified or could become subject to additional costs. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We could incur liability under national or local environmental laws or regulations, either as a polluter or as the party managing certain aspects of any of our owned facilities, including the Huntstown plants. We do not have any reserved cash funds held to meet requirements with environmental regulations and any such requirements imposed on the Huntstown plants, or our other owned facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of facilities that we have acquired, leased or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets, we may obtain, or be required to provide, indemnification against certain environmental liabilities. Another party could, depending on the circumstances, assert an environmental claim against us or fail to meet its indemnification obligations. We do not have any provisions in our accounts for environmental liabilities, but the Huntstown plants carry insurance that would cover such liabilities as a result of sudden and accidental pollution. Any costs incurred in relation to such environmental liabilities over and above those covered by applicable insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In early 2022, the EPA initiated a review of the Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 IED licenses to take account of the EU best available techniques (“BAT”) conclusions. Energia Group submitted a response in relation to compliance with the BAT conclusions on April 28, 2022. The EPA have not yet issued the license amendments for Huntstown 1 and 2 in relation to the Large Combustion Plants Directive (“LCP”) BAT conclusions. The details of potential amendments have been discussed with the EPA and any changes are expected to be in line with Energia Group’s submission on LCP BAT conclusions, which will introduce some tightening of emission limit values to air within the technical capability of the Huntstown plants. Increased obligations are also being applied to suppliers in relation to energy efficiency. In March 2014, the RoI Government transposed the EU Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency into national law. This Directive was subsequently updated and adopted by the Council of the EU in 2018. This legislation obliges suppliers to achieve a validated energy savings amount equal to certain annual targets notified by way of energy efficiency notice. The obligation commenced with effect from January 2014 and is intended to apply until December 2030. A failure to achieve this level of energy savings will result in a prescribed penalty amount being applied to suppliers. The RoI Government has the right to set the penalty amount. In 2023 the penalty amount was significantly increased on the prior period applicable from 2014 to 2022. The cost of compliance will continue to increase in the forthcoming years as further energy efficiency savings may become more onerous to achieve. The compliance cost and/or penalties levied under this regime could be material and we will therefore seek to recover all or a portion of any such costs from our customers in the retail market. Such recovery may be difficult to achieve in a competitive market environment and any costs incurred in relation to such regulation and not off-set through market prices or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

For example, we rely on Siemens and Mitsubishi to regularly maintain and service the Huntstown plants, Global Energy Services for the operation and maintenance of our wind farms and Fluence for the operation and maintenance of our battery storage facility in Belfast as well as a small number of suppliers for our natural gas requirements. In addition, we outsource a significant portion of our information and communication technologies requirements to a third-party supplier, Capita Managed IT Solutions Limited (“Capita”) and our voice and data telecoms services are provided by British Telecom through a contract managed by Capita. There is a risk of disruption to the Group if there are any service delivery failures or availability issues. Although the Group maintains comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans to manage this risk, our dependence on these relationships may impact our ability to negotiate favorable contract terms with these counterparties, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to replace any material suppliers or service providers in a timely manner, or at all, in the event that any of these relationships were to be discontinued or terminated. If we are unable to negotiate favorable contracts with our suppliers or service providers, or such suppliers or service providers are unable to fulfil their obligations or discontinue business with us and we are unable to find other suitable replacements, our business, financial condition and operational results may be materially adversely affected. We also have long-standing relationship with regulatory bodies, such as the CRU, the DECC, the UR and the DfE, as well as with customer advocacy groups, such as the Consumer Council for NI, the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Irish Business and Employers’ Confederation, in each case in relation to our business activities in NI and RoI. While we have a productive relationship with these regulatory bodies and customer advocacy groups, there is no guarantee we will be able to maintain these relationships and any disruption may materially adversely affect our business. In our electricity and gas supply business, we rely on our relationships with a number of large customers. While the loss of any single customer is not expected to have a material impact on our business as a whole, if we were unable to maintain our relationships with our large customers, we could lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In our electricity and gas supply business, we rely on our relationships with a number of consultants who represent one or more customers.

Such restrictions could impact the Group’s own operations and the operations of its customers. The Customer Solutions electricity and gas supply businesses rely on both residential and commercial customers, which could be adversely impacted from the introduction of such restrictions. The Group has centrally coordinated business continuity plans in place (including pandemic response plans) covering the various locations where each business operates and office-based staff have the capability to work from home securely. While the Group is well-positioned to operate through a period of government-imposed restrictions, there could be a risk that the Group’s customers are adversely impacted and therefore their demand for electricity and gas could be reduced. Furthermore, if such restrictions were to be imposed there could be a risk that commercial and residential customers may not be in a position to pay their electricity and gas bills and the Group could be exposed to an increased risk of payment default and bad debts.

Physical effects of climate change such as increases in temperature, sea levels, the severity of weather events and the frequency of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, wildfires, floods and earthquakes, among other effects, could result in physical damage or a decrease in in the value of our plants and other assets. In the worst case, such assets could even be damaged beyond repair as a result of such natural disasters. The costs of remediating or repairing such damage, or of investments made in advance of such weather events to minimize potential damage, could be considerable. Additionally, such actual or threatened climate change related damage could increase the cost of, or make unavailable, insurance on favorable terms. Whilst we take steps to mitigate such impacts, including investing to protect our plants and other assets from future impact of climate change and insuring our assets with appropriate and available insurance, there is a risk that there may be events that arise which are unforeseen or are not covered by insurance. If insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in legislation and regulations on climate change could result in increased utility expenses and/or increased capital expenditures to improve the efficiencies of our assets or other related aspects of our assets in order to comply with such regulations or otherwise adapt to climate change. Compliance with new laws or regulations relating to climate change, including compliance with planning consent and licensing regimes or any carbon reduction or other greenhouse gas emissions regulation, may require us to make improvements to our existing assets or result in increased operating costs that we may not be able to effectively pass on to our customers.

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.23,We rely on electricity and natural gas interconnectors with Great Britain to meet our electricity and natural gas requirements.,"Ireland relies heavily on natural gas interconnectors from Great Britain for its natural gas supply. In the RoI, there are two interconnectors, IC1 and IC2, that transport natural gas from Great Britain’s natural gas transmission network. The natural gas transmission system in NI imports natural gas from Scotland through the Scotland-to-NI Pipeline. Disruption of, or any restriction on access to, these pipelines, or of the common single section of pipeline on mainland Scotland that supplies these pipelines with natural gas, would impact upon the ability of our Huntstown plants to operate. Furthermore, EU sanctions against Russia could result in a shortage of gas in Europe, which, in turn, could affect the flow of gas supplies to the UK and Ireland. Should the Governments of the UK or RoI need to ration the supply of gas there is a risk that the Huntstown plants will not be able to generate due to gas not being available (noting also that there is no emergency storage or LNG facility in Ireland). In such a situation, the Huntstown 1 and 2 plants both have the ability to run on fuel oil as their secondary fuel source, however prolonged running on fuel oil may be constrained by the capacity of fuel oil stored onsite and the rate at which the storage tanks can be refilled as well as by the requirement for environmental permits. We also purchase electricity from the UK through two high-voltage direct current interconnectors, the Moyle Interconnector, which runs between Scotland and NI, and the East-West Interconnector, which runs between Wales and the RoI. A significant disruption in transmission from either interconnector could force us to purchase additional quantities of electricity from alternative sources under potentially unfavorable commercial terms, which could significantly increase our expenditure for electricity. Over the years there have been a number of faults on the Moyle Interconnector and the East-West Interconnector, which have resulted in their unavailability or reduction in available capacity until such faults were repaired. Any disruption to the supply of natural gas or electricity from Great Britain to the RoI or NI could significantly increase our expenditure for natural gas (or alternative fuel sources) or electricity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to undertake such operational and maintenance measures largely depends on our cash flow from our operations and access to capital. However, we may have unforeseen capital expenditure needs for which we may not have adequate capital, including urgent repairs or measures to update or replace essential equipment that has become faulty or breaks down. If we do not have adequate capital to service our plants, we may not be able to operate our plants as efficiently, or at all. In addition, parties to our PPA agreements and our assets may experience reduced capacity availability as a result of generator faults, gear box rebuilds, grid availability issues or other mechanical failures, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues. Our assets, including our electricity generating plants, battery storage, and hydrogen generation assets, require regular maintenance and the provision of this maintenance is itself subject to certain risks. A number of problems may arise in relation to our facilities during maintenance, which may cause interruptions to production, including, among other things, failed deliveries by suppliers or manufacturers or longer-than-expected periods for technical adjustments. In particular, failure of a contractor to perform our contracted services and/or a change in a contractor’s financial circumstances in conjunction with an overreliance on particular contractors may, among other things, result in the relevant asset either underperforming or becoming impaired in value and there can be no assurance that such underperformance, impairment or delay will be fully or partially compensated by any contractor warranty or bank guarantee (which are usually limited in scope and amount, and typically will not cover full loss of profit).

The departure of any of our executive officers or key employees may have a negative impact on our operations, ----- including possibly adversely affecting our ability to provide the service levels our customers expect. The ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel applies across all of the Group’s operations and business functions. In particular, electricity regulation is a specialized field with a limited pool of qualified and experienced personnel while the renewable energy industry is a relatively new industry and, as a result, there is a limited pool of technically qualified personnel with substantial experience. The Group also faces market-led initiatives that require significant investment in specialist personnel in order to deliver complex IT projects required to operate in the market. The Group has a dedicated corporate development team in place responsible for the delivery of identified strategic objectives as well as an IT project management office to oversee the delivery of IT projects who have substantial knowledge of the Group and the industry. We compete with a number of companies as well as government entities and other organizations for qualified personnel and, consequently, we have encountered and may continue to encounter difficulties in retaining certain key employees and attracting new personnel. In addition, the work from home response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in employees in all industries looking for increasingly flexible working options in the future. People now also have more choice about the industry, company and location in which they wish to work and in some areas this has led to scarcity of skills in the market, e.g. IT. While the Group has introduced a hybrid working model for office-based personnel, future personnel strategies will need to be kept under review to ensure that they are sufficiently flexible and in line with evolving practices. This could introduce new risks, which will be required to be managed. Increasing competitiveness in the market for talent has led to increasing salary and benefits inflation, which, in turn, has increased the risk of attrition. While the Group has increased its focus on engagement and retention strategies, there is a risk that there could be a loss of talent from the Group.

The Group’s appetite for tax risk is low and our policy is to manage our tax liabilities in an efficient manner and in compliance with relevant legislation and guidance. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we have not anticipated or made provisions for or that we currently do not collect or pay.

Our cash flows may be negatively impacted to the extent we are required to make any additional payments to any relevant defined benefit pension plans in excess of the amounts assumed in our current projections and assumptions or report higher pension plan expenses under relevant accounting rules. Furthermore, there is a risk that the cost of funding the defined benefit could increase if investment returns are lower than expected, mortality rates improve or salary or benefit increases are higher than expected. Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, pension regulators and authorities may be granted extensive powers that may be exercised in connection with the completion of certain transactions. For example, the UK Pensions Regulator has powers to impose contributions to a UK defined benefit pension scheme, or to put in place arrangements for the financial support of the pension scheme, including, but not limited to, requirements to provide additional security in support of such scheme. The new UK Pension Schemes Act 2021, which came into force in October 2021, may also significantly impact future corporate activity of entities with a UK defined benefit pension scheme. The new legislation provides for new criminal offences targeting “risking accrued scheme benefits” and the “avoidance of employer debt,” which may be interpreted as to include ordinary corporate activity ----- in certain circumstances. Moreover, the new legislation introduces wider powers for the UK Pensions Regulator to intervene in corporate activity (including acquisitions and internal restructurings), and new requirements to give advance notification of certain corporate activity and to provide statements to the UK Pensions Regulator, which may require the input of the pension scheme trustee, with regard to the expected impact of such activity on the pension scheme. Any future changes to, or strengthening of, pension legislation or regulations (particularly the regulatory funding regime), could increase requirements for cash funding, demanding more financial resources to meet governmentally mandated pension requirements.

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will not limit the amount of hedging that can be given priority with respect to the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging liabilities will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any credit facility that refinances or replaces the Revolving Credit ----- Facility and such hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realized.

As a result, proceeds from the sale of Collateral in connection with any enforcement action may be insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, our hedging obligations, the Notes and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Indenture, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement will regulate the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group (as defined in “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises (i) creditors holding more than 66[2]/3% of the Indebtedness and commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) or (ii) the holders of the required principal amount of the then outstanding Notes as set out in the Indenture (or if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding Notes), and if the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness is equal to or more than €25,000,000, the holders of the required principal amount of the then outstanding indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes as set out in the relevant documents governing such debt (or if the required amount is not specified, the holders holding at least the majority of the principal amount of the then outstanding amount of such indebtedness) whose principal amount outstanding under the Notes and such indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) at that time aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Notes/Pari Passu",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

If, before the super",13.3.1,The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes.,"The Notes and the Guarantees will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral described in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations. The Revolving Credit Facility contains a mechanism under which commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased and any such increase will also benefit from first-priority security interests in the Collateral. Upon a refinancing ----- of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, or if the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are increased, the amount that will benefit from “super-priority” first-priority security interests in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Collateral may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes, as the case may be, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral, which will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain exceptions (and subject to release provisions in certain circumstances, including asset sales), consist of: (1) pledges over the shares held by the Company in Energia Group Fundco I Limited, by Energia Group ROI Holdings DAC in the Issuer, and certain of the subsidiaries of the Company in their subsidiaries (excluding Unrestricted Subsidiaries), (2) an assignment of the structural intercompany receivables owed to the Company by Energia Group Fundco I Limited and (3) fixed and floating charges over all or substantially all of the assets of certain material subsidiaries of the Company incorporated in Cayman Islands, England and Wales, RoI and Northern Ireland, in each case, subject to certain exceptions, and excluding shares in Unrestricted Subsidiaries and assets pledged in connection with the Single Electricity Market Trading and Settlement Code, the Gas Code of Operations and other standard electricity and gas market industry documents, as applicable, consisting of the relevant assets of the Issuer, Energia Customer Solutions Limited, Huntstown Power Company Limited, Energia Power Generation Limited, Energia Group NI Holdings Limited and Belfast Energy Storage Company Limited. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy their obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral may be subject to fluctuations over time based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the share charges of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or other Collateral or that, if such market does exist, there will not be substantial delays in their liquidation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness, which may result in the creation of new hardening periods. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or re-created were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period ----- applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of such Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) has priority.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring the Collateral within the time periods specified, the failure of which would result in an event of default under the Indenture. Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims under the Notes, if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. We may not be able to perfect any such security interests. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. Perfection of the security interests in the Collateral after the Issue Date increases the risk that the liens granted by those ----- security interests become avoided or subject to the liens of intervening creditors or intervening or existing liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may also result in the invalidity or the lack of effectiveness of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

Investors in the Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Notes) other than the members of the company with respect to those reports. In the context of the offering of the Notes, the Group’s independent auditors have reconfirmed that they do not intend their duty of care in respect of such Financial Statements to extend to any party other than those to whom their reports were originally addressed. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the language quoted above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third-parties is unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the UK, and the legal effect of these statements in the audit reports is untested.

The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own, and has not engaged in, and will not engage in, any activities other than those relating to its finance activities. The Issuer will be dependent upon payments from other members of the Group to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to meet their obligations under the Notes through interest payments on one or more intercompany loans. If the other members of the Group do not fulfil their obligations under the intercompany loans, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within the Restricted Group. Such restrictions include those created by the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the year ended March 31, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors generated 32.4% of the Group’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (excluding all intragroup items except the allocations of intercompany costs from the Huntstown plants and the intercompany PPA revenue from the Unrestricted Subsidiaries) and as at March 31, 2023, held 54.0% of the Group’s consolidated total assets (excluding Consolidation Adjustments).

Unless a member of the Group is a Guarantor, such member will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor companies, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such non-guarantor companies before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such company; and - creditors of such non-guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As at March 31, 2023, and as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the Restricted Group’s total debt would have been €600 million, which reflects the Notes and excludes letters of credit issued under our Revolving Credit Facility. As at March 31, 2023, and as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the Group’s total debt would have been €888.5 million, which includes the outstanding ring-fenced non-recourse project finance facilities borrowed by the Unrestricted Subsidiaries. See “Capitalization.” The Group’s significant leverage could have important consequences for its business and for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Notes and other debts and liabilities; - increasing vulnerability to, and reducing its flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures (including the development of the Group’s renewables businesses), acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development or other general corporate purposes; - limiting its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the competitive environment and the industry in which the Group operates; - placing the Group at a disadvantage to its competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting its ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of the foregoing or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations, including the Notes. The Group’s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt and to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on its future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. The Group’s ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative, regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond its control. Therefore, the Group may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service its debt, or to fund its working capital needs, or capital expenditure (including renewable energy projects).

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The Notes will be guaranteed by entities organized or incorporated in England and Wales, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Cayman Islands. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency event, proceedings could be initiated in RoI or in one or more other jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are domiciled. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of the rights of holders of the Notes. The bankruptcy laws of these jurisdictions may be less favorable to your interests as a creditor than the bankruptcy laws of the U.S. or any other jurisdiction you may be familiar with, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the ability to influence proceedings and the duration thereof, and this may limit your ability to receive payments due on the Notes. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future guarantors of the Notes, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer and certain other transactions, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce the rights of holders of the Notes under the Guarantees or the rights of holders of the Notes under the relevant collateral for the Notes in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. In addition, in actions brought in countries outside of the United States, courts may choose to apply their own law rather than the law of the State of New York, which governs the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of the Group’s subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. ----- The Group cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date the Group’s Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee of the Notes will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee which has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if a Guarantor cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, it cannot assure you that it can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our Revolving Credit Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, under certain circumstances, we are required to repay a pro rata amount of debt under our Revolving Credit Facility if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the Notes. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that the Group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control if at the time our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than a certain specified level. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain definitions— _Specified Change of Control Event.”_ ----- The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Company’s assets and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,Group activities and reporting segments,"_Renewables_ Renewable energy continues to be a key priority in NI and the RoI and both governments have set targets for increasing the proportion of electricity sourced from renewables. NI’s energy strategy targets the achievement of 80% renewable electricity by 2030 and the RoI Climate Action Plan also sets an 80% renewable electricity target by 2030. ----- As at March 31, 2023, the Renewables segment owns and operates 309MW onshore wind generation assets across the RoI and NI, and has a pipeline of 49MW onshore wind generation assets under construction and 218MW of onshore wind generation assets in development. The Renewables segment also has a pipeline of 628MW of solar PV projects in development, and is currently commissioning a hydrogen electrolyzer onsite at one of its NI onshore wind farms. In addition, the Group is also progressing the development of two offshore wind generation projects off the coast of Ireland totaling up to 1.8GW. The Renewables segment’s operational and inconstruction onshore wind generation assets are outside of the Restricted Group. Similarly, assets in relation to the pipeline of other wind projects and solar PV projects, are also owned by Unrestricted Subsidiaries and therefore outside of the Restricted Group. The Restricted Group received distribution from the unrestricted subsidiaries under the Existing Notes Indenture totaling €61.8 million during Fiscal Year 2023. The Renewables segment also purchases renewable electricity through PPAs covering 1,247MW of operating renewable capacity as at March 31, 2023. Energia Group was the first independent supplier to participate in the deregulated electricity market and an early mover on offering offtake contracts to third parties. Its first renewable PPA was signed in 2002. The Group estimates that it currently represents approximately 21% of the Irish market for Renewable Obligation Certificates (“ROCs”) and Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (“REFIT”) supported wind PPAs. The Renewables segment provides the Energia Group with further access to regulated renewable support mechanisms, with minimal capital requirements and potential upside to the extent of future increases in wholesale power prices, as well as positioning Energia and Power NI as ‘green’ suppliers and enhancing relationships and presence with key stakeholders within the sector. In addition, the Group has a entered into a REFA with Microsoft designed to meet a substantial proportion of their electricity demand in Ireland, whereby the output from the Renewables segment’s pipeline of in-development onshore wind projects (including the 49MW of renewable capacity currently under construction) and solar PV projects are expected to be supported by corporate PPAs with the technology company. Energia Group’s Renewables segment revenue for Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022 was €427.2 million and €401.9 million, respectively, and its Adjusted EBITDA during these periods was €224.5 million and €211.5 million, respectively. _Flexible Generation_ The Flexible Generation segment undertakes trading, regulation and asset management activities on behalf of the Group. This includes the day-to-day operation and commercial optimization of two CCGT plants (Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2) owned by the Group. The two Huntstown CCGTs are highly reliable, flexible and efficient plants, and their strategic location in the constrained Dublin area ensures at least one unit is running on most days of the year. Moreover, the Huntstown plants have the technical capacity to provide system-critical “Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System” (“DS3”) ancillary services, the importance of which has been increasing as the proportion of electricity generated by wind in Ireland has been growing. As at March 31, 2023, Huntstown has a total combined generation capacity of 747MW, which is able to supply approximately 10% of peak demand on an all-island basis (based on estimated peak demand of approximately 7,700MW). We believe that the two Huntstown CCGTs are critical to the security of electricity supply in the Dublin area. Under the Single Electricity Market (“SEM”), the Huntstown plants sell the generated energy into the Day-Ahead (“DAM”), Intra-Day (“IDM”) and Balancing Mechanism (“BM”) markets and sell capacity several years in advance via ‘Reliability Options’ as part of the Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (“CRM”). The Reliability Options have been awarded to the Group’s Huntstown plants for the current and next four capacity years, and include a clearing price of €83,050/MW for the capacity year 2026 to 2027. See also “Industry—The _All-Island Single Electricity Market—Energy Trading Arrangements—Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM).” Huntstown sells energy at the market clearing prices in the DAM and IDM as well as receive (or in some_ cases make) other payments for energy through constraint payments in the BM. The Huntstown plants also receive payments associated with DS3 ancillary services. The Group has also recently developed and commissioned a 50MW battery storage project in NI which is operated and traded by the Flexible Generation business. The project has been awarded a 10-year capacity contract commencing in the capacity year 2022/2023, at a clearing price of £78,600/MW for 8.15MW of its 11.3MW derated capacity. The Group plans to develop a further pipeline of battery storage projects, which we expect will strengthen the Group’s position for future capacity auctions and provide an additional source for ancillary revenue. The Group has also entered into a contract with EirGrid to provide 50MW of emergency gas generation located at the Huntstown site for a duration of three years, extendible by EirGrid to five years. ----- Construction of this emergency gas generation project commenced in December 2022 and is planned to be completed by the end of 2023. The Group is developing a 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin. The proposed data center has a grid connection offer and the lands necessary for the project have been acquired. Planning consent for the data center was received in April 2022 but the decision was appealed and the planning application is currently being considered by An Bord Pleanála, RoI’s national independent planning body. The Group expects _An Bord Pleanála to issue its decision in the near term and does not believe that there are grounds on which_ planning permission should be refused. The Group has entered into a contract with an international hyperscale technology company for a long term lease by it of the electrical infrastructure, buildings and integrated equipment at the data center. Capital expenditure in respect of the development of the data center was €20.0 million in Fiscal Year 2023 and €11.1 million in Fiscal Year 2022, primarily, in respect of land and development of electrical connections. Going forward, the Flexible Generation segment’s investment in the proposed data center in respect of the development of the data halls is expected to be an unrestricted investment and therefore outside of the Restricted Group. Investment in respect of the purchase of land, the design and build of all the high voltage electrical infrastructure (including a gas insulated substation and high voltage transformer switchyard) will be within the Restricted Group. The Flexible Generation segment also includes the Group’s PPB business which administers 600MW of contracted generation capacity from the Ballylumford power station in NI, which is subject to price control and entitles it to an allowance (effectively a management fee). This legacy PPB contract will expire in September 2023 in accordance with its terms. The PPB contract generated €14.6 million, €8.5 million and €9.3 million of EBITDA during the Fiscal Year 2023, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2021, respectively. For Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022, Flexible Generation generated €1,769.7 million and €989.5 million in revenue, respectively, and €204.7 million and €104.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, based on, or after taking into account the adjustments for over/under recovery against, the regulated entitlement of PPB. _Customer Solutions_ The Group’s Customer Solutions business operates under the Energia and Power NI brands. Energia Energia is a price control unregulated retail supply business, which supplies electricity and natural gas to residential and business customers in the RoI. Business customers include LEU and SME customers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Energia supplied electricity to 14% of the LEU market, 30% of the SME market and 12% of the residential market in the RoI in terms of consumption. As part of its hedging strategy, the Group’s Flexible Generation segment undertakes wholesale electricity, natural gas, carbon and green certificate trading activities on behalf of the Customer Solutions segment. Power NI Power NI is the incumbent electricity supplier in NI, supplying electricity primarily to residential customers. While the residential electricity supply market in NI is open to competition, Power NI remains the biggest supplier with a 55.0% market share of residential supply in terms of consumption during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. As a result, Power NI is still regarded as the dominant supplier and is therefore subject to price regulation. As a regulated business, Power NI is subject to price control which permits it to recover an allowance calculated by reference to its forecasted operating costs at the time of the relevant price control, plus an allowed margin based on a percentage of forecasted regulated revenue. On January 26, 2023, the UR confirmed the extension of the existing price control (which applies in respect to residential customers) to March 31, 2025. In addition, Power NI supplies electricity to business customers in the unregulated market and secures additional revenues through off-take from certain contracted smaller scale third party renewable generators (which are reported through the Renewables segment). In addition, the Customer Solutions business also offers energy efficiency services and car charging solutions to its customers across Ireland. For Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022, Customer Solutions generated €2,345.2 million and €1,780.1 million in revenue, respectively, and a loss of €162.1 million and €115.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA, ----- respectively, based on, or after taking into account the adjustments for over/under recovery against, the regulated entitlement of Power NI.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.2,,"The Group is a leading integrated Irish energy business active in both Republic of Ireland (“RoI”) and Northern Ireland (“NI”). The Group primarily operates through three business units: - Renewables; - Flexible Generation; and - Customer Solutions. The Renewables business owns and operates 309MW of onshore wind generation assets as at March 31, 2023, and purchases electricity from 1,247MW of renewable generation capacity across Ireland as at March 31, 2023, through off-take contracts (primarily, renewable Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”)). In line with the Group’s decarbonization strategy, the Renewables business has expanded in recent years and now has a substantial pipeline of additional onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (“PV”) development projects and has also entered into a renewable energy framework agreement (“REFA”) with Microsoft, which is designed to meet a substantial proportion of their electricity demand in Ireland. The Renewables business is also currently commissioning a hydrogen electrolyzer onsite at one of its NI onshore wind farms and is progressing the development of two offshore wind generation projects off the coast of Ireland totaling up to 1.8GW. The Flexible Generation business owns and operates 747MW of conventional gas-fired generation assets in the RoI and procures power under contract with 600MW of conventional generation assets in NI, in each case, as at March 31, 2023. In addition, under the Flexible Generation business, the Group is currently undertaking the following key initiatives: - 50MW battery storage project in NI, which has been recently commissioned; - 50MW emergency gas generation project under a contract with EirGrid that is currently under construction and is planned to be commissioned by the end of 2023; and - a 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin, which is currently under development. The Customer Solutions business supplies electricity or gas to a total of 828,300 customer sites across Ireland, comprising 311,700 customer sites in the RoI and 516,600 customer sites in NI, as at March 31, 2023, through its two retail brands, Energia and Power NI. With a digitally-enabled customer-centric focus, the business also offers energy efficiency services and car charging solutions to its customers across Ireland.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors affecting results of operations,17.2.1,Capacity and availability,"The Group receives a significant proportion of its revenue from capacity payments and wholesale generation sales. Revenues are impacted by the availability of generation capacity and generation volumes. There are two key revenue streams: (i) capacity payments, which are earned under Reliability Options received when the Group’s generation plants are successful in capacity auctions; and (ii) payments for generating and/or being scheduled to generate electricity, which are earned when the Group’s generation facilities are scheduled and/or dispatched by the system operator to generate electricity. Under SEM, whether a plant is scheduled to generate electricity is a function of its position in the Merit Order. See “Industry—Generation—The Merit Order” and “Industry—Generation—Network infrastructure, constraints and curtailment.” _Capacity payments_ The capacity remuneration mechanism, or CRM, was established by the UR and the CRU with the objective of ensuring the adequate supply of electricity by encouraging the construction and maintenance of electricity generation capacity and by promoting efficient long-term price signaling and price stability. The CRM capacity year runs from October 1 to September 30, and the mechanism is operated through capacity auctions, open to owners of physical generation assets and other capacity providers, that awards Reliability Options to successful bidders at the market clearing price (or above, if constrained on). A Reliability Option is a one-way contract for difference, entered into between a generator and a central agency, that incentivizes a generator to generate electricity at times of market price spikes in exchange for a fixed payment, while foregoing incremental revenue (by means of a “difference payment”) when the market price is above a defined strike price. Reliability Options may be awarded on an elevated pay-as-bid basis within certain constrained network areas. The maximum bid that may be submitted by an existing generator in the capacity auction is limited, by rule, to half the estimated net cost of new entry of a new dispatchable power plant (which at present is assumed to be an OCGT plant), unless a higher unit-specific price cap is granted to a generator. See “Industry—The All-Island Single Electricity _Market—The Single Electricity Market—Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM).”_ The Reliability Options awarded to the Group’s Huntstown plants for the current and next four capacity years is summarized as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Economic conditions influence electricity demand and the pricing of fuel commodities and electricity, which affect both the revenues and costs associated with the Group’s operations. The regulatory framework determines the parameters within which the industry, generally, and the Group, specifically, operates. Industry-specific factors include technology, competition, capacity and supply/demand balance. Groupspecific factors that impact the Group’s operating results include, but are not limited to, plant reliability and efficiency, management of fixed and variable operating costs, capital expenditure requirements, management of working capital, customer retention, collection of receivables and bad debts, and the extent to which the Group has hedged its exposure to the SMP and commodity prices.

Between Fiscal Year 2021 and Fiscal Year 2023, Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 plants had average availabilities (including planned and unplanned outages) of approximately 91% and 76%, respectively. For Fiscal Year 2022, Huntstown 2 plant’s availability (including planned and unplanned outages) was 44.3%, compared to 83.9% for Fiscal Year 2021, reflecting a transformer outage whereby on January 29, 2021, a fault was identified on the Huntstown 2 main generator transformer which resulted in the plant not being available to the market and resulted in a material impact to Group revenues as further discussed in “—Results of operations.” A new replacement transformer was procured and successfully installed and commissioned and the plant returned to service on October 23, 2021. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Mechanical failure, equipment _malfunction or technological breakdown could adversely affect our business and operating results.”_ For Fiscal Year 2022, Huntstown 1 plant’s availability (including planned and unplanned outages) was 97.0%, compared to 81.9% for Fiscal Year 2021, reflecting a 57-day planned major outage which commenced in October 2020 and was successfully completed in December 2020. For Fiscal Year 2023, Huntstown 2 plant’s availability was 99.4% compared to 44.3% for Fiscal Year 2022 (availability in Fiscal Year 2022 reflects the plant being unavailable since January 29, 2021 due to the generator transformer outage with subsequent return to service on October 23, 2021). For the Fiscal Year 2023, Huntstown 1 plant’s availability was 94.8% compared to 97.0% for the Fiscal Year 2022, reflecting a 12 day unplanned outage as a result of the failure of a circuit breaker connected to the plant’s static frequency convertor. While these outages, with the exception of the Huntstown 2 transformer outage, were largely within the Group’s planned guidelines, they nonetheless had an impact on the Group’s results for the periods in which they occurred. The Group expects availability going forward to remain high, considering planned outage time and an estimated 3% allowance for unplanned outage time based on historical performance. _Renewables_ The Group’s renewable PPA portfolio primarily consists of off-take contracts with third party owned wind farms alongside wind generation assets in which the Group has an equity interest. The Group, pursuant to its Customer Solutions business, has entered into contracts with developers under which it has agreed to purchase the long-term output of a number of wind farm projects and with generators from other renewable sources (e.g., anaerobic digestion and biomass technologies). As at March 31, 2023 the Group had PPAs in place with an operating capacity of 1,247MW of which the NI operating capacity was 664MW and the RoI operating capacity was 583MW.

Based on their median demand scenario, EirGrid and SONI have forecast annual all-island electricity demand to grow, on average, by 3.5% per year from 2021 through 2031; however, such growth is dependent on the factors described above as well as under the heading “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

A large proportion of demand is currently met by coal and gas-fired generators whose ranking in the Merit Order fluctuates depending on the relative coal-to-gas price differentials and carbon prices. Last in the Merit Order are generation units such as oil-fired turbines, which are mainly used as peaking plants with typically the highest marginal costs. The Huntstown plants are reliant upon the continued provision of imported natural gas in terms of both capacity and commodity price risk, although the plants can switch to less efficient distillate oil, if necessary. However, their Merit Order position may also be affected by: - the commissioning of new more efficient power plants that can generate electricity at a lower marginal cost than the Huntstown plants as well as; and - increased wind and solar PV capacity. ----- For Fiscal Year 2023, average unconstrained utilization was 63.9% for the Huntstown 1 plant and 73.0% for the Huntstown 2 plant compared with 65.5% and 44.0%, respectively, for Fiscal Year 2022 and 68.4% and 54.7%, respectively, for Fiscal Year 2021. The decrease in unconstrained utilization of Huntstown 2 in Fiscal Year 2022 compared to Fiscal Year 2021 reflected a transformer outage whereby on January 29, 2021, a fault was identified on the Huntstown 2 main generator transformer which resulted in the plant not being available to the market. A new replacement transformer was procured and successfully installed and commissioned and the plant returned to service on October 23, 2021. The Huntstown plants have experienced incremental constrained utilization to support the grid within the Dublin region. The Huntstown plants are frequently dispatched “out of merit,” and at any time, at least one of the plants is typically running either “in merit” or on a “constrained” basis to ensure system stability. For Fiscal Year 2023, the incremental impact of constrained utilization was 4.1% constrained on for the Huntstown 1 plant and 11.4% constrained off for the Huntstown 2 plant compared with 0.9% constrained on and 0.4% constrained off, respectively, for Fiscal Year 2022 and 2.6% constrained off and 6.2% constrained off, respectively, for Fiscal Year 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

NI’s energy strategy is built around a target to achieve 80% renewable electricity by 2030 and the RoI Climate Action Plan also sets an 80% renewable electricity target by 2030. To help achieve these targets, both governments have provided mechanisms to support investment in renewable sources. See “Industry—Generation—Thermal generation.” _Support for renewable energy_ In the RoI, support for renewable energy is currently provided by the RESS and Offshore RESS (ORESS) schemes having previously been provided by the REFIT scheme. Both RESS and ORESS allocate support in the form of a two way CfD via a competitive pay as bid auction. The Climate Action Plan 2023 commits Ireland to having 9GW of onshore wind, 8GW solar PV and at least 5GW of Offshore wind installed by 2030, with the expectation being that RESS and ORESS will provide the route to market for the majority of this capacity. The First RESS auction took place in 2020, procuring over 1.2GW of onshore wind and solar PV at an average strike price of €74.08/MWh. RESS 2 took place in 2022 and awarded support to just under 2GW of capacity at an average price of €97.87/MWh again predominantly onshore wind and solar PV. RESS 3 is scheduled to take place in 2023, targeting the procurement of almost double the capacity in RESS 2. RESS 4 is scheduled to take place in 2024 and will seek to procure a similar quantity of capacity to RESS 3. The first offshore RESS auction (ORESS1) took place in May 2023, procuring over 3GW at a weighted average strike price of €86.05/MWh for a 20 year term. Latest government policy indicates that a second offshore RESS auction for 900MW (ORESS2.1) off the South coast process could begin by the end of 2023 with an auction expected in the first half of 2024. ORESS2 is expected to run up to two further auctions, so that ORESS1 & ORESS2 will procure the 5GW of capacity required to achieve the CAP target. European State aid clearance for the RESS and ORESS Scheme expires in 2025, although it may be possible to extend it beyond 2025. In the RoI, support for renewable energy was provided by the REFIT scheme, which is now closed to new capacity. REFIT was implemented in 2006 and was designed to encourage licensed electricity suppliers to enter into PPAs for up to 15 years with renewable generators, under which the suppliers would contractually agree the off-take price to be paid to the generators. Electricity suppliers are then compensated for the additional cost of purchasing electricity from renewable sources. Under REFIT, suppliers are compensated if the SEM market price, including constraint payments achieved for electricity generated and capacity payments earned by a particular renewable generating unit in a calendar year, is below a base reference price. The reference price is indexed annually (upwards only) at the RoI Consumer Price Index, and in 2023 is set at a floor of €78.356/MWh for large scale wind generation and €81.105/MWh for smaller scale wind generators together with an unindexed (in the case of REFIT 2 and REFIT 3) supplier balancing payment of (a) in the case of REFIT 1, 15% of the large scale wind price for REFIT 1 (being €11.754/MWh for 2023) and (b) in the case of REFIT 2 and REFIT 3, up to €9.90/MWh, depending on the extent to which the market revenues exceed the applicable reference price in REFIT 2 and 3, REFIT, therefore, requires a minimum price to be paid to electricity suppliers for electricity sourced from renewable generators while allowing the supplier to retain any price upside should the SEM market price exceed ----- the floor price. The REFIT floor price mechanism is of particular value in markets with volatile fuel and electricity prices. DfE are consulting on the implementation of a new support scheme for NI, which, although not yet decided, is expected to be in the form of a 2-way CfD type contract awarded via a competitive auction. NI’s prior support mechanism was an extension of the RO regime used in Great Britain. The previous scheme, called the NI Renewables Obligation (NIRO) closed to new large scale onshore wind on March 31, 2016, to new small scale onshore wind on June 30, 2016 and to all other technologies on March 31, 2017, with exceptions to those projects that met the criteria for grace periods. Under the NIRO regime, eligible renewable generators receive ROCs for each MWh of electricity generated. ROCs are freely tradable at auction and can be sold to suppliers in order to fulfil their obligations under the RO regime. Suppliers have the option of presenting ROCs to cover their obligations or paying a buyout fee of £59.01/MWh (for the 2023-24 financial year) for any shortfall. All proceeds from buyout fees are repaid to the holders of ROCs. _Constraints and curtailment_ The TSOs have a responsibility to ensure that the electricity system is managed prudently which requires generation to be constrained at certain locations. To ensure efficient and secure operation of the electricity system, generation is constrained to certain levels to prevent overloading, voltages outside prescribed limits or system instability. In the context of wind farms, a constraint event occurs when there is insufficient capacity on the network to accept the export of the generator. Access to the transmission network is currently offered either on a “firm” or “non-firm” basis depending on whether network reinforcements are required to facilitate the generator’s full export capacity. While a generator which has been granted firm access to the transmission network may experience a reduction in its exported generation at times of high system production, it is eligible to receive limited financial compensation. Non-firm generators by contrast are not entitled to financial compensation for any reduction in its exported generation experienced due to either constraint or curtailment. However, a generator with non-firm access may have its exported output reduced without any compensation. Firm access would only be granted once the required investment in the transmission network infrastructure has been completed or by a deemed firm date which the TSO notifies to each generator. Curtailment is a system operation issue and is not linked to the capacity of the network. Curtailment of wind generation occurs where there is excess wind generation available relative to system demand when taking account of system operation restrictions (such as minimum stable generation levels of thermal assets). Curtailment occurs when this excess wind generation cannot be accommodated and the overall level of renewable generation must be reduced across the system. While the increasing amount of wind generation capacity in Ireland naturally increases the risk of curtailment, the increase in ancillary services under DS3 and the potential for an increase in electricity exports to Great Britain (and in future to France) under SEM are expected to provide a countervailing influence. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—The quantity of electricity actually produced by _Energia Group’s wind farms and PPAs, including as a result of curtailment and constraint actions by the TSO, may vary from its estimates” and “Industry—Generation—Network infrastructure, constraints and curtailment.” NI supply regulation_ While RoI electricity market prices are fully deregulated, in NI, Power NI residential customers remain subject to a regulated tariff. The last non-residential customer segment (customers consuming less than 50MWh per year) was only fully deregulated from April 1, 2017. The UR’s plans for deregulation of the residential market are not yet clear. As a result, the Group is unable to accurately predict the structure of future market regulation and further deregulation could affect the Group’s market share. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business— _Our businesses are subject to complex governmental legislation and regulations that have affected, and may in the future affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_ The regulated tariffs set by the UR are currently based on an allowed revenue model, which allows Power NI to recover an allowance calculated by reference to its forecasted operating cost at the time of the relevant price control and residual depreciation plus a net margin. The regulatory model has an incentive mechanism by which Power NI is allowed to retain savings achieved through efficiencies for at least the period of the price control. If the amount of revenue recovered in any one year exceeds or falls short of the amount allowed by the relevant price control formula, a K factor operates in the following year that requires either a repayment of any surplus with interest or a recovery of any deficit with interest, as appropriate. A surplus is referred to as an overrecovery and a deficit as an under- recovery. In the formulation of its regulated tariffs, Power NI is allowed to pass through to customers all underlying wholesale costs, subject to an economic purchasing obligation. ----- Power NI is required to submit a forecast of all its input costs for each tariff review, which is then subject to agreement with the UR. The main tariff year runs from October each year. Once agreed, the new tariffs apply from October 1, with the possibility that they may be changed at the beginning of each quarter if actual costs and revenues do not stay within a level of tolerance to the tariff (i.e., plus or minus 2.5%). On June 2, 2023 Power NI announced a 5.1% increase in its regulated electricity tariff, effective from July 1, 2023. The increase, agreed with the UR, reflected a reduction in government support.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The ability to pass wholesale prices to end customers is affected by the level of competition and regulation. Regulated businesses, such as Power NI, are entitled to recover their operating costs and make a regulated margin. As this margin is relatively low, it restricts competition in the regulated marketplace, but it also places a limit on the regulated business’ profitability. Unregulated supply businesses may be significantly more exposed to competition, and their ability to recover their operating costs depends on the level of competition. There is limited liquidity in the market for CfDs related to the SMP, which means that supply businesses may be exposed to cost premiums for such CfDs and may be required to resort to less effective hedging arrangements or risk exposure to increases in operating costs that they may not be able to recover in the market. However, the Group considers supply businesses backed by physical generation capacity within the SEM, such as the Energia Group, which is backed by Huntstown and its owned and contractual wind farms, are better protected against such cost premiums as they benefit from a natural hedge against price spikes, outage at other generators or a drop in wind output to the extent of the overlap between generation and supply volumes. Although the Energia Group substantially hedges any mismatch, mainly through CfDs, it is exposed to movements in the wholesale price when the hedges expire and to the extent of any unhedged or imperfectly hedged volume. See “Business—Hedging.” Bad debts can have a material impact on cash flows, especially during periods of economic downturn. Historically, Energia and Power NI have been successful at minimizing bad debt levels, with a bad debt to revenue ratio of 0.2% for Energia and 0.3% for Power NI for Fiscal Year 2023. The Group considers that this was achieved through proactive credit management, including a focus on creditworthiness at the time of customer acquisition, and the use of prepayment meters and direct debit payment plans. For Fiscal Year 2023, approximately 35.4% of Power NI’s customers utilized prepayment meters and approximately 92.0% of Energia’s customers and approximately 39.0% of Power NI’s customers paid using a direct debit payment plan. In addition, the Energia Group mitigates the effect of customers defaulting by using credit insurance in respect of certain customers.

However, because variations in demand from season to season are largely offset by counterbalancing movements in natural gas transmission costs, seasonality does not tend to have a significant impact on the Group’s profitability from period to period. However, changes in demand and prices caused by seasonal variations can have an impact on the Group’s working capital over the course of the year, with working capital typically increasing during the winter months when demand and prices are high, and decreasing during the summer months.

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.33,Liquidity and capital resources,17.33.1,Liquidity,"Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and other commitments. The Group’s primary sources of liquidity are cash from operating activities and its financings. In addition, the Group currently has access to the Revolving Credit Facility to service working capital and general corporate needs. The Group’s liquidity requirements arise primarily to meet debt service obligations, to fund capital expenditures (including the development of the Group’s Renewables and Flexible Generation businesses) and to provide working capital (including collateral required to ----- be posted to the markets in which the Group trades). The availability of the Revolving Credit Facilities is dependent upon conditions, including compliance with a financial maintenance covenant as described further under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” The Group’s financial condition and liquidity is and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including: - the Group’s ability to generate cash flows from its operations; - the level of outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness of the Group’s subsidiaries, and the interest on such indebtedness; - the Group’s ability and the ability of the Group’s subsidiaries to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions; and - the Group’s growth funding requirements, which consist primarily of the funding of development of its Renewables and Flexible Generation businesses. The Group’s cash requirements consist mainly of the following: - funding working capital requirements (including collateral required to be posted to the markets in which the Group trades); - funding capital expenditure needs (including the development of the Group’s renewables businesses); - servicing the Group’s indebtedness and the indebtedness of the Group’s subsidiaries; - operating activities; and - paying taxes. The Group expects that its sources of liquidity will consist mainly of the following: - cash generated from the Group’s operating activities; - borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility; - issuances of debt securities; and - borrowings under other loan facilities and finance leases, including project finance facilities. Although the Group believes that its expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet its anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, no assurance can be given that the Group’s business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to the Group in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund other liquidity needs. The Group believes that potential risks to its liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows, which could be due to downturns in performance or the industry as a whole; - a reduction in the ability of the Group to obtain dividends or other distributions from the businesses in its Unrestricted Subsidiaries; - adverse working capital developments (including potential shifts by market operators to cash collateral requirements away from letters of credit); - exposure to increased interest rates in relation to borrowings which bear interest at a variable rate, including the Revolving Credit Facility; and ----- - higher capital expenditure, such as due to higher than expected expenses incurred in connection with the Group’s development projects and strategies. If the Group’s future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay its obligations as they mature or to fund liquidity needs, the Group may be forced to: - reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditure (including development projects); - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinancing all or a portion of the Group’s debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. No assurance can be given that the Group would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the Group’s existing debt, including the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, limit the Group’s ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The Indenture governing the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement collectively contain covenants significantly restricting the Group’s ability to, among other things: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or incur certain liens; - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase capital stock of the Company or its restricted subsidiaries; - make certain investments; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to, and on the transfer of assets to, the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries; - transfer, lease or sell assets; - merge or consolidate with other entities; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - enter into unrelated businesses; - impair the security interests in the Collateral; and - amend certain documents. Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. These covenants could limit the Group’s ability to finance its future operations and capital needs. The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring the Group to comply with a certain minimum EBITDA level when the Revolving Credit Facility is drawn beyond a certain level at the end of a quarter (which financial covenant applies only to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement). ----- Management anticipates that the Group’s significant leverage could increase for the foreseeable future and an increase in the Group’s high level of debt may have important negative consequences for you.

The cash flow for Fiscal Year 2023 reflects the impact of high commodity prices and inflation on collateral requirements. The net movement in security deposits was an outflow of €30.8 million for Fiscal Year 2022. The cash flow for Fiscal Year 2022 reflects the impact of high commodity prices on collateral requirements. The net movement in security deposits was an outflow of €0.2 million for Fiscal Year 2021. The cash flow for Fiscal Year 2021 reflects the replacement of letters of credit with cash security deposits. As at March 31, 2023 there were €56.6 million of security deposits in place (March 31, 2022: €42.1 million; March 31, 2021: €11.3 million). _Changes in working capital_ Working capital consists of inventories plus trade and other receivables (primarily retail energy sales including unbilled consumption wholesale energy income, capacity payment income and ROC sales), prepayments and accrued income less trade and other creditors (primarily wholesale energy costs, capacity payments, natural gas and fixed natural gas capacity costs, renewable PPA costs, ROC costs, emission costs and use of system charges), payments received on account, accruals and tax and social security. Group working capital Working capital increased by €7.6 million for Fiscal Year 2023, primarily reflecting a decrease in trade and other payables (reflecting a decrease in gas prices (March 2023 relative to March 2022), a reduction in volumes partly offset by an increase in contract liabilities (associated with the RoI Electricity Support Credit scheme), provision for the Inframarginal Revenue Cap and Electricity Generator Levy and a net increase in emissions liabilities/assets (associated with an increase in carbon prices and higher generation volumes) and an increase in ROC assets, partly offset by a decrease in trade and other receivables (reflecting a decrease in contract assets (associated with proceeds from the Huntstown 2 outage insurance claim and lower hedge accrued income due to lower gas prices (March 2023 relative to March 2022)) and by an increase in trade receivables (due to increased tariffs and prices partly offset by lower volumes)). Working capital decreased by €155.5 million for Fiscal Year 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in trade and other payables (reflecting higher prices, an increase in the Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) creditor (previously debtor) for Renewables PPAs resulting from higher prices, a decrease in ROC assets held, a net increase in emissions liabilities/assets (driven by higher prices and volumes), partly offset by an increase in trade and other receivables (reflecting higher prices, an increase in hedge debtors (partly offset by early settlement of some hedges when gas prices peaked in March) together with amounts outstanding for the property damage and business interruption insurance claim. Working capital increased by €109.9 million for Fiscal Year 2021, primarily reflecting a reduction in the PSO creditor in PPB, an increase in the Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) debtor for renewable PPAs, an increase in ROC assets, favorable reassessment of SEM market resettlement provisions and an increase in trade and other receivables (reflecting higher electricity sales volumes and prices). _Over/(under)-recovery of regulated entitlement_ The regulated businesses of Power NI and PPB over-recovered against their regulated entitlement by €149.8 million for Fiscal Year 2023, over-recovered by €35.5 million for Fiscal Year 2022, and over-recovered by €34.4 million for Fiscal Year 2021. These changes were primarily due to the phasing of tariffs. _Exceptional cash outflows_ Exceptional cash outflows of €1.1 million for Fiscal Year 2023, €1.1 million for Fiscal Year 2022 and €0.3 million for Fiscal Year 2021, primarily relate to costs associated with acquisitions and disposals (whether successful or not). ----- _Capital expenditure_ Capital expenditure in respect of tangible fixed assets and intangible software assets increased to €103.0 million for Fiscal Year 2023 from €66.5 million for Fiscal Year 2022, reflecting increased capital expenditure in the Renewables, Flexible Generation and Customer Solutions businesses as outlined below. Capital expenditure in respect of tangible fixed assets and intangible software assets increased to €66.5 million for Fiscal Year 2022 from €39.5 million for Fiscal Year 2021, reflecting higher expenditure in Renewables and Customer Solutions offset by lower expenditure in the Flexible Generation businesses, reflecting lower expenditure in respect of the storage and data center projects. Capital expenditure at Renewables increased to €40.6 million for Fiscal Year 2023 from €14.7 million for Fiscal Year 2022, reflecting capital expenditure on development projects (notably including the commencement of construction of the Drumlin on-shore windfarm project and expenditure on off-shore projects). Capital expenditure was €17.2 million for Renewables for Fiscal Year 2021. Capital expenditure at Flexible Generation was €49.3 million for Fiscal Year 2023 and €39.1 million for Fiscal Year 2022 primarily reflecting initial expenditure on the data center and emergency generation projects (primarily in respect of the purchase of lands and infrastructure costs) partly offset by lower expenditure on the recently commissioned 50MW battery storage project in NI. Capital expenditure was €7.2 million for Flexible Generation for Fiscal Year 2021. Capital expenditure at Customer Solutions companies increased to €13.1 million for Fiscal Year 2023 (Fiscal Year 2022: €12.7 million), primarily reflecting higher expenditure in respect of IT projects. Capital expenditure was €15.1 million for Customer Solutions for Fiscal Year 2021. _Other_ The Group can have significant movements in its liquidity position due to working capital variations such as the movements in commodity prices, the seasonal nature of the business and regulatory under- and overrecoveries. Short-term liquidity is reviewed daily by the treasury function and Group cash forecasts, covering a rolling two-year period, are reviewed monthly. Liquidity, including short-term working capital requirements, is currently managed through the Existing Revolving Credit Facility together with available cash resources. In March 2022, with the consent of its lenders, the Group increased the Existing Revolving Credit Facility to £305 million (previously £225 million) and extended the maturity to June 2024 (previously September 2023). At March 31, 2023, the Group had letters of credit issued under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility of €236.8 million (at March 31, 2022: €193.3 million; at March 31, 2021: €155.0 million) resulting in undrawn committed facilities of €29.1 million (at March 31, 2022; €109.0 million; at March 31, 2021: €109.2 million).

Provisions are made based on previous experience and identifiable events which indicate a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. Sustained periods of volatile and increasing prices for gas and carbon have resulted in higher SEM market prices for electricity. In this regard, with increasing electricity prices being passed through to customers through higher tariffs, the Group has applied an incremental allowance for expected credit losses in line with the methodology adopted. However, there remains a risk that the actual level of deferral or default on payments by customers is higher than that assumed when estimating the provisions made at the balance sheet date. Energia and Power NI are not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk in respect of their trade receivables, with exposure spread over a large number of customers, but may be exposed to credit-related loss in the event of non-performance by hedging counterparties. Energia and Power NI hold credit insurance and obtain security deposits, where relevant, under their credit policies in respect of certain trade receivables. Energia, PPB and Power NI also receive security from certain suppliers in the form of letters of credit, parent company guarantees or cash collateral. The Group may be exposed to credit-related loss in the event of non-performance by bank counterparties. The Group manages this credit risk by establishing and monitoring counterparty exposure limits which are adjusted and tightened when necessary. The Group actively manages its banking exposures on a daily basis and cash deposits are placed for periods not exceeding six months to provide maximum flexibility.

The market has become more stable, with a number of fixes applied by the Market Operator; however, the Group’s energy purchase and supply businesses remain exposed to some energy price resettlement risks. As at March 31, 2023 the Market Operator has resettled these markets up to December 3, 2022 for M+4 resettlement and March 5, 2022 for M+13 resettlement in line with the expected market resettlement timetable of 4 months and 13 months after initial settlement. The market has had two main system fixes released over the last year; however, further market fixes are required to be implemented before the market settlement solution can be considered fully aligned to the market code requirements, with a number of additional resettlements to occur ranging across the full 54-month period since the market commenced. The Group therefore continues to be exposed to potential price resettlements in the balancing market and estimates the level of resettlement that may be applied. These estimates are based on known market anomalies as discussed in industry forums and facts and circumstances known at the Balance Sheet date. Estimations are dependent on the resettlement approach taken by the market operator. There is therefore a significant degree of judgement required in order to estimate the level of resettlement that will be applied. During Fiscal Year 2023, an estimated average of approximately 1.6% from October 2018 (During Fiscal Year 2022: estimated average of approximately 3.5% for all periods from October 2018) of balancing market revenues is considered a reasonable estimate and is supported by actual resettlements seen in the market to date, and reflect the various fixes applied by the market operator during the past 12 months. A quantitative sensitivity analysis in relation to these key assumptions shows that, for every 1% increase or decrease in the percentage used in the resettlement provisions for balancing market exposures would be an increase or decrease to operating profit respectively of €3.8 million. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Further regulations that came into effect in 2000 established EirGrid, a statutory company owned by the RoI government) as the RoI’s independent transmission system operator (the “TSO”). EirGrid operates the RoI’s electricity transmission system under a regulated agreement with the incumbent utility ESB (a corporate body owned by the RoI government), which retains ownership of the onshore transmission and distribution network assets. ESB retains responsibility for operation of the distribution system. Prior to liberalization, ESB had a monopoly position at all levels of the electricity supply chain and supplied customers through bundled tariffs set by the RoI Government. Although ESB was reorganized after liberalization of the RoI electricity market, it retains a significant market share in both generation (through ESB Power Generation) and retail supply (through Electric Ireland). Since liberalization, a number of companies have entered the RoI electricity market and established strong market positions, some of which include: - Energia Group, which developed the Huntstown plants, and Energia as its competitive retail supply business. - Scottish and Southern Energy, now known as SSE plc (“SSE”), a public company that entered the RoI market in 2008 by acquiring Airtricity, operates both a renewable generation and retail supply business. SSE also acquired generating units with a capacity of approximately 1,000MW from Endesa in 2012 (which Endesa had previously purchased from ESB in 2008) and subsequently built a 464MW CCGT plant in 2015. - Bord Gáis Energy Limited (“BGE”) a former subsidiary of the State-owned Bord Gáis Eireann (now known as Ervia) acquired by Centrica in 2014 and which owns the 445MW Whitegate CCGT plant and the electricity and natural gas retailing businesses (including the brand) of Bord Gáis Eireann. - Orsted, which in 2021 acquired Brookfield’s onshore renewable energy business in Ireland (which Brookfield had acquired from Bord Gáis Eireann in 2014) and in 2023 entered into a joint venture with ESB for the development of offshore wind in Ireland. - EirGrid, which commissioned the 500MW HVDC EWIC (running between the RoI and North Wales) in 2013 and is currently developing the 700MW Celtic Interconnector (running between RoI and France). The retail RoI electricity market has been fully deregulated since April 2011, when ESB’s retail market share fell below the regulated threshold of 60% for residential customers and 50% for business customers. All residential and business customers in the RoI are therefore able to choose their electricity supplier.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

During the first phase of privatization, the UK Government sold the four then-existing thermal generating plants, with combined capacity of approximately 2GW, under long-term PPAs and established NIEN to perform all non-generation functions, including acting as the contractual counterparty to the PPAs, thereby constituting the single buyer of electricity in the NI market. ----- In the second phase of privatization, in 1993, NIEN, comprising transmission and distribution, power procurement and supply, was listed on the London Stock Exchange. At this time, entry into the retail market was deregulated. However, new entrants were required to purchase power from NIE under a bulk supply tariff, which had the effect of restricting competition. NIEN was restructured in 1998 into separate regulated and unregulated businesses, under the holding company Viridian Group PLC (the Viridian Group). The Viridian Group was acquired by Arcapita in 2006. The System Operator for NI (“SONI”) was sold to EirGrid in 2009 and the transmission and distribution business was sold to ESB NI in 2010. In 2016 Arcapita sold the Viridian Group to I Squared Capital Funds and the Viridian Group was renamed as the Energia Group in 2019. The Moyle Interconnector, a 500MW interconnector between Scotland and NI commissioned in 2002, is owned by Moyle Interconnector Limited, a subsidiary of Mutual Energy Limited (a NI mutual company formed to acquire and hold energy infrastructure assets in NI). The Moyle Interconnector is operated under contract by SONI. Other than the 600MW Ballylumford CCGT plant and the 400MW Coolkeeragh CCGT plant, the only other generation commissioned in NI since liberalization began in the 1990s has been renewable generation and 84MW of distillate-fired generation at Kilroot that is generally only operated to meet peak demand when there is low wind output. Existing coal/oil fired generation at Kilroot is expected to close in the near term (2023), to be replaced by new gas fired generation. All customers in the NI market are able to choose an electricity supplier. Although the retail market is fully open to competition, Power NI, the regulated incumbent residential electricity supplier, continues to be the largest supplier (by number of supply points) to the residential and small business segments.

At the heart of the SEM was a mandatory “gross pool” that provided a transparent wholesale electricity price and a guaranteed outlet for all electricity production on the island of Ireland, together with an explicit capacity payment mechanism. The SEM wholesale market was adopted by the CRU and UR following a long period of development in order to provide advantages over the pre-existing bilateral contracts markets in the areas of security of supply, efficiency, practicality, equity and competition, while maintaining stability. In February 2014, the relevant authorities launched a process to further evolve the unified Irish electricity market in order to maximize the efficient use of interconnectors and ensure compliance with the EU Target Model.

The SEM and its component energy markets have been physically disconnected from the EU since Brexit, as reflected in the description below. However, the Celtic Interconnector, a planned 700MW DC interconnector linking the SEM to France with a target commissioning date of Q4 2026, will physically reintegrate the SEM with the EU energy markets and this is expected to bring about revisions to the current SEM structure to facilitate new cross-border trading opportunities. ----- _Financial Forwards Market_ The financial forwards market provides market participants with opportunities to hedge against energy price fluctuations months to years in advance of energy delivery. It allows participants to trade “CfDs,” which are hedging instruments in which a price is struck (the “strike price”) for a quantity of energy delivered on a future day. The contract holder then receives or pays the difference between the strike price and the spot price on the delivery date (called the “reference price”), depending on which side of the trade was taken by that holder. For example, a generator might agree a CfD with a supplier, under which the generator would pay the supplier the difference if the reference price was in excess of the strike price on the delivery date, while the supplier would pay the generator the difference if the reference price was lower than the strike price. This allows generators and suppliers effectively to lock-in pricing for fixed quantities of electricity on specific future days, as a hedge against price spikes or dips in the spot market. Products traditionally available in advance of the DAM include CfDs between market participants or in the form of a Directed Contract (DC), whose price and volume is set by the SEM Committee. Settlement under these CfDs is generally also capped such that the spot price is effectively capped at the RO strike price (if the spot price was to be higher than the RO strike price then suppliers will be compensated under the RO mechanism). _The Day Ahead Market (DAM)_ The DAM is a daily auction to allow day-ahead trading within the SEM (it is no longer coupled with Great Britain) and is the largest ex-ante Energy Market by volume and value. The DAM auction takes place at 11 a.m. Irish time for the 24-hour trading day starting the same evening at 11:00 p.m. Irish time. Participation for generation is largely on a unit-basis with aggregation for demand. The use of different bid formats is permitted to allow thermal generators to reflect technical characteristics such as start-up costs. An algorithm determines the market price and position for all participants on an hourly basis. Participation in the DAM is not mandatory, but it is the only way of achieving a day-ahead position in the SEM that will minimize market participants’ exposure in the balancing market. Participants have opportunities to adjust their position by trading in the intraday markets. _The Intraday Markets (IDM)_ Following the DAM, the IDM allows participants to adjust their physical positions closer to the time power is delivered. The IDM consists of three daily auctions (two of which are coupled with Great Britain via the interconnectors) and a separate continuous (SEM only) market. _The Balancing Market (BM)_ The Balancing Market reflects actions taken by the TSOs to keep the system balanced and secure. Unlike the other ex-ante Energy Markets, participation in the Balancing Market is mandatory. Before and into real time, the TSO calls on system services to keep the transmission system balanced (i.e., energy supply = energy demand), carry reserve and manage energy flows on the transmission system. System services, including Energy balancing services, are offered into the Balancing Market (BM) by generators (energy producers) and suppliers (energy consumers). For example, if demand is higher than expected, the TSO might instruct a generator with available capacity to increase its output. The generator is then paid through the BM for the additional energy used to balance the grid. The Balancing Market determines the imbalance settlement price for settlement of these balancing actions. This includes any uninstructed deviations from a participant’s notified ex-ante position. A market participant’s net energy position is the accumulated volume of all its trades on the ex-ante Energy Markets (DAM and IDM) and any balancing actions taken by the TSO in the Balancing Market. Typically in the ex-ante Energy Markets, generators will establish traded positions to maximize profitability and suppliers will establish traded positions to match their expected physical position and reduce their exposure to the imbalance price determined in the Balancing Market. _Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM)_ The CRM allows generators to recover a proportion of their fixed costs. It also helps to ensure there is enough capacity to meet demand and that this capacity is purchased competitively through auctions. Capacity providers can sell pre-qualified capacity to the market in the form of Reliability Options, which rewards those who contribute to the reliability of the power system when needed. A Reliability Option is a one-way contract for difference, entered into between a generator and a central agency, that incentivizes a generator to generate electricity at times of market spikes in exchange for a fixed payment, while foregoing incremental revenue when the market price is above the strike price. Auctions are normally held by the TSOs between one and four years ahead of delivery. ----- Generation plants that are “in-merit” in the CRM auction (that is, plants offering a price low enough to be selected to meet the capacity requirement) will be paid based upon the market clearing price set by the highest accepted bidder. However, as the Irish electricity network has limitations and operational constraints, generation plants can therefore be required for system stability in certain ‘locationally constrained’ zones irrespective of their Merit Order position in the CRM auction. These plants typically play a system-critical role in balancing the energy network and ensuring security of supply and will therefore be paid “as bid” within the auction framework. The Group’s Huntstown plants are located in localized constraints in the Dublin area and are therefore frequently dispatched to alleviate system constraints. Existing generation plants are required to be bid into the CRM auction, unless a plant is due to close before the capacity period being auctioned, has an extended outage, or is due to be mothballed. Bids into the CRM auction are subject to regulatory caps. The general Existing Capacity Price Cap (“ECPC”) is one half of the net Cost of New Entrant (“CONE”), which is determined using a best new entrant calculation carried out by the SEMC. This calculation makes reference to the cost of developing a new OCGT power plant. A generator can also apply for a Unit Specific Price Cap (“USPC”) if the plant can justify to SEMC that its net going forward costs are higher than the ECPC. New entrants will be able to bid up to 1.5 times net CONE and secure a contract for up to 10 years. Subject to market conditions, a new entrant plant can set the clearing price of the CRM auction for the first year of its contract resulting in all generators participating in that auction receiving the new entrant price for that year. The value for net CONE is reviewed periodically by the SEMC. The value of net CONE for previous auctions and the next scheduled auction is shown in the table below.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The _ex-ante physical markets (DAM and IDM) are settled daily. Each participant appoints a clearing member—a bank that is a member of the European Commodity Clearing (“ECC”) house—who settles with the market operator on behalf of the participant. The ECC has also introduced a direct clearing market participant model to allow small and medium size enterprises to access certain spot markets without the need to appoint a bank. The ECC acts as a central counterparty for all payments in the market and guarantees payments in the event of a default by a participant. The ECC assesses the collateral requirements of each clearing member and ensures it holds adequate security to protect against default. Each clearing member then imposes similar obligations on the participant. Under SEM, the Group expects that collateral requirements in these markets will often be fulfilled using cash collateral or letters of credit. The Balancing Market is settled weekly. Settlement documents reflect balancing and capacity transactions in that billing period. Credit management is in the form of credit cover provided by a qualified bank. The market operator draws on the participant’s credit cover to cover any defaults and monitors the exposure of every participant. Settlement in the BM takes into account instructed and uninstructed imbalances. The payments and charges that arise from balancing depend on the nature of the imbalance, the commercial data submitted, the status of the generating unit, the available metering data, and other data. Settlement and credit risk management for the FM and FTR auctions are outside the SEM arrangements. Capacity providers receive a monthly capacity payment based on the capacity provider’s awarded capacity and the price paid. Payment is made regardless of whether the capacity provider is scheduled to physically deliver energy. Settlement can also include difference charges if the reference price exceeds the strike price. In such an event, capacity providers also pay a capacity difference charge for any undelivered capacity. Difference charges are settled weekly to align with the billing period for energy payments and charges.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.5,Ancillary Services—DS3,18.5.1,,"The provision of system services to the TSOs by flexible, responsive gas fired plants has become essential as wind penetration has increased in the Irish energy market, fostered by governmental policies aimed at having renewable sources supply up to 80% renewable electricity (RES-E) by 2030. Wind is an intermittent and nonsynchronous technology; moreover, power demand in Ireland varies on daily and seasonal cycles, and often not in tandem with changes in the supply of wind power. To address system security arising from even greater wind penetration, the TSOs established a multi-year program called “Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System” (“DS3”). As part of the DS3 program, new system services under regulated tariff arrangements were introduced in 2016, funded by an annual budget which has increased from €75 million to €235 million. This has been important in enabling increased levels of non-synchronous renewable energy on the system, increasing the maximum System Non-Synchronous Penetration (“SNSP”) level from 50% to 75% while maintaining system stability. The Group’s Huntstown plants have played an important role in this regard providing ancillary services required under DS3, and additionally benefiting from DS3 Locational Scarcity Scalars for certain services provided in the Dublin area which is funded by a further €12.5 million per annum (over and above the €235 million budget) The DS3 Locational Scarcity Scalars for the Dublin area are in place until October 1, 2024, after which time it is unclear if they will be continued. Further development of system services is needed to deliver SNSP levels of 95%+ required to achieve 2030 RES-E targets. This combined with EU requirements under the Clean Energy Package (CEP) and the Electricity Balancing Guideline (EBGL) Network Code has led to the launch of a System Services Future Arrangements (SSFA) project in July 2020. The High Level Design (HLD) for the SSFA was published by the SEMC on April 14, 2022. The HLD puts in place a framework for the competitive procurement of system services comprising daily auctions and longer-term contracts and it is envisaged that a transitional period will be required. The detailed design for the SSFA has yet to commence, which will include numerous industry consultations. It has been recently proposed by the SEM Committee that the regulated tariff arrangements will be extended by 24 months until 30 April 2026 (with a phased reduction of tariff rates) to allow sufficient time for the competitive arrangements to be implemented. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

These forecasts are used to derive the capacity requirement of upcoming capacity auctions and give an appropriate view of the range of possible demand growths facing Ireland. In the median scenario, which represents EirGrid’s best estimate, energy demand is forecasted to increase 37% by 2031, from 2021 levels. The largest growth comes from data centers and new tech load, and increased uptake of EVs and heat pumps, particularly later in the decade.

There is currently a statutory ban on nuclear development in RoI. Due to the Clean Energy Package (CEP) legislation and CO2 emission limits for capacity payment eligibility, along with increasing restrictions due to Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) legislation, the latest GCS shows that thermal generation using coal and oil as their primary fuel will decommission by 2025 (including 855MW coal fired generation at Moneypoint and 590MW oil ----- fired generation at Tarbert). This capacity, and the capacity from other plant expected to retire out to 2030, is expected to be replaced by new gas-fired generation, battery energy storage, interconnection, and demand side units. However, a large proportion of new generation (730MW) awarded capacity contracts in previous auctions, that was expected to come online in 2022 / 2023, has been withdrawn by the developers. This combined with a prolonged outage of SSE’s oil-fired generation units (590MW) at Tarbert and expected demand growth, has given rise to a negative security of supply outlook in Ireland for the remainder of this decade. Mitigating measures include temporary emergency generation and potentially delaying the closure of existing units. The CRU confirmed in February 2023 (in CRU Information Note CRU202317) that EirGrid’s public procurement exercise for a first tranche of temporary emergency generation has resulted in contracts being signed for 200MW at Northwall (ESB) and 50MW at the Huntstown campus (provided by Energia Group). Procurement for a second tranche of up to 450MW of temporary emergency generation has also resulted in the initial equipment contracts being signed for 258MW of capacity in Shannonbridge (ESB) and 150MW in Tarbert (SSE Generation Ireland Limited). The CRU also communicated that EirGrid continues to engage with a number of operators about extending the operational life of existing units. In NI, installed generation capacity is largely a mix of coal, natural gas and oil plants, with a gradually expanding contribution from wind generation and other renewables. Similarly, to the RoI, existing coal/oil fired generation in NI (476MW at Kilroot) is expected to close in the near term (2023), to be replaced by new gas fired generation. The security of supply outlook for NI is also negative, in this case because the replacement gas fired generation (two new OCGTs at Kilroot) is expected to be subject to annual run hour limits (ARHL) as a result of IED emissions limits. There is an additional steam turbine intended to become operational at the Kilroot site in 2026, this unit is expected to remove any ARHL as the plant will have the ability to operate as a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), at which point the security of supply outlook becomes positive. Interconnectors supplying electricity from Great Britain compete against generators in RoI and NI. Ireland currently has limited interconnection capacity to Great Britain through its two HVDC interconnectors: (i) the Moyle Interconnector which interconnects NI to Scotland has an import capacity of 450MW and an export capacity of 270MW; (ii) the EWIC between Wales and the RoI and has a capacity of 500MW in either direction. Two further HVDC interconnectors are currently under construction: (1) the Greenlink Interconnector (500MW) between Ireland and Wales (potentially commissioning in 2024); and (2) the Celtic Interconnector (700MW) between Ireland and France (potentially commissioning in 2026).

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Electricity generated in Ireland by fuel type,18.10.1,Support for renewable energy,"_RoI_ In the RoI, support for renewable energy is currently provided by the RESS and offshore RESS (ORESS) scheme, having previously been provided by the REFIT scheme. Both RESS and ORESS allocate support in the form of a two-way CfD via a competitive pay as bid auction. The Climate Action Plan 2023 commits the RoI to having 9GW of onshore wind, 8GW solar and at least 5GW of Offshore wind installed by 2030, with the expectation being that RESS and ORESS will provide the route to market for the majority of this capacity. The First RESS auction took place in 2020, procuring over 1.2MW of onshore wind and solar at an average weighted strike price of €74.08/MWh. RESS2 took place in 2022 and awarded support to just under 2GW of capacity at an average weighted price of €97.87/MWh again predominantly onshore wind and solar. RESS 3 is scheduled to take place in 2023, targeting the procurement of almost double the capacity in RESS 2. RESS 4 is scheduled to take place in 2024 and will seek to procure a similar quantity of capacity to RESS 3. The first offshore RESS auction (ORESS1) took place in May 2023, procuring over 3GW at an average strike price of €86.05/MWh for a 20 year term. Latest Government policy indicates that a second offshore RESS auction for 900MW (ORESS2.1) off the South coast process could begin by the end of 2023 with an auction expected in the first half of 2024. ORESS2 is expected to run up to two further auctions, so that ORESS1 & ORESS2 will procure the 5GW of capacity required to achieve the CAP target. European State aid clearance for the RESS and ORESS Scheme expires in 2025, although it may be possible to extend it beyond 2025. The precursor to RESS was the REFIT scheme implemented in 2006. The scheme was designed to encourage licensed electricity suppliers to enter into PPAs for up to 15 years with renewable generators, under which the suppliers would contractually agree the off-take price to be paid to the generators. Electricity suppliers were then compensated for the additional cost of purchasing electricity from renewable sources. Under REFIT, suppliers are compensated if the SEM market price, including constraint payments achieved for electricity generated and capacity payments earned by a particular renewable generating unit in a twelve month period, is below a base reference price. The reference price is indexed annually (upwards only) at the RoI Consumer Price ----- Index, and in 2023 is set at a floor of €75.856/MWh for large scale wind generation and €81.105/MWh for smaller scale wind generators together with an unindexed (in the case of REFIT 2 and REFIT 3) supplier balancing payment of €9.90/MWh in each case. Suppliers claim any shortfall between the market and the floor prices in an annual period from a PSO Levy pool administered by the CRU. Suppliers are also compensated for the cost of balancing renewable generation via a balancing payment equating to 15% of the floor price for large scale wind generation per MWh generated in REFIT 1 and up to €9.90/MWh (not indexed) for REFIT 2 and 3 depending on the extent to which market revenues exceed the reference price. All REFIT Schemes are now closed to new applicants. REFIT support therefore ensures that a minimum price is paid to electricity suppliers for electricity sourced from renewable generators while allowing the supplier to retain any price upside should the price captured by the supplier in the market exceed the floor price. The market reference price (upon which payments to and from the supplier are calculated) was altered in SEM to the lower of either 100% of the DAM price or an 80:20 split between the DAM price and Balancing Market price (for renewable units exceeding 5MW). Note that for units less than 5MW of installed capacity, the benchmark price will instead be calculated as the lower of either 100% of the DAM price or a 70:30 split between the DAM price and Balancing Market price. This configuration was brought in to provide a level of flexibility to entities trading wind power in the market and reflects the fact that wind units are now balance responsible in SEM and maybe reluctant to overcommit volumes in the DAM. The REFIT floor price mechanism is of particular value in markets with volatile fuel and electricity prices, as has been particularly the case over the past two years. The mechanism allows renewable energy to earn full market upside when fuel prices are high and provides the floor price when they fall. Typically, the contract price paid to the generator would include some, but not all of the balancing payment plus the applicable level of REFIT support, effectively splitting the balancing payment subsidy between the generator and the supplier. Market upside is also typically split. As with the REFIT scheme, RESS was designed once again to encourage suppliers to enter into PPAs for approximately 15 years with renewable generators. Suppliers agree to an off-take price with the RESS generator, orientated around the strike price the generator has been awarded in a RESS. RESS support is awarded on the basis of a pay as bid auction and thus varies by generator. RESS support was not inflation indexed for RESS 1 and 2 however the proposed terms and conditions for the 2023 RESS 3 auction suggested the DECC might introduce at least partial indexation. ORESS support operates in broadly the same manner as RESS support but is partially inflation indexed and is for a 20 year term. The nature of the support paid to suppliers on behalf of their PPA contracted RESS generation is a two-way CfD orientated around the individual generator’s strike price. Suppliers will therefore be required to make payments back to the PSO pot if wholesale market prices exceed the project’s strike price. As before if wholesale prices are less than the strike price, suppliers will be topped up to the project’s strike price. Unlike REFIT however, the wholesale benchmark price (upon which payments to and from the supplier are calculated) for renewable RESS is entirely the DAM price. For ‘variable’ generators (such as wind farms) the reference price is the hourly DAM price, for non-variable generators the reference price is the time weighted average of the DAM price over the PSO year. Crucially however for RESS no support is paid if the market reference price (the DAM price) is less than zero. _NI_ Presently there is no support scheme available to new renewable generators in NI. The DfE is consulting on introducing a support scheme presently, with the expectation being that support could be provided in the form of a two-way CfD scheme along similar lines to RESS in Ireland and the CfD scheme in Great Britain. The previous scheme the NIRO, closed to new large scale onshore wind on March 31, 2016, to new small scale onshore wind on June 30, 2016 and to all other technologies on March 31, 2017, with exceptions to those projects that met the criteria for grace periods. The NIRO was the major route to market for renewables in NI and was largely responsible for NI’s achievement of its 2020 Renewable target to source 40% of NI’s electricity from renewable sources. Under the NIRO regime, eligible renewable generators receive ROCs for each MWh of electricity generated. ROCs are freely tradable at auction and can be sold to suppliers in order to fulfil their obligations under the NIRO regime. Suppliers have the option of presenting ROCs to cover their obligations or paying a buyout fee of £59.01 /MWh (for the 2023-2024 financial year) for any shortfall. All proceeds from buyout fees are repaid to the holders of ROCs. The Renewables Obligation Order (Northern Ireland) 2009, as amended, introduced a banding system for generators, which presented a different number of ROCs per MWh depending on the renewable technology. ----- The bands affect only those projects that were developed after the reforms came into force in 2009, with all accredited projects and generation capacity in existence prior to 2009 grandfathered from the prior ROC scheme. Prior to 2009, there had been a single level of support for all renewable technologies of one ROC per MWh. DETI regularly reviewed the banding system to ensure that the level of support offered was in line with generation costs and continued to incentivize renewables development. For onshore wind farms commissioned in NI after April 1, 2013, the ROC value was reduced to 0.9 ROCs per MWh. This reduction does not apply to onshore wind farms that were operational at that date or became operational within a proposed grace period of six months or those wind farms with a capacity of less than 5MW. In June 2013, DETI confirmed that it did not intend to further review the banding support levels for large scale onshore wind under the RO regime. DETI decided to close the NIRO to large scale onshore wind projects one year early from March 31, 2016. The NIRO Closure Order closed the NIRO to all new large (>5MW) onshore wind capacity from April 1, 2016 and also introduced extensions of time, known as “grace periods” for certain qualifying projects. The new deadlines granted under the grace periods varied depending on the eligibility criteria and ranged from March 31, 2017 to December 31, 2017 and where the qualifying conditions, and all other NIRO eligibility criteria, were satisfied, they could be combined to give extensions of time up to December 31, 2018 at the latest. The NIRO Closure Order permitted large scale onshore wind projects to seek to accredit for the NIRO after April 1, 2016 and up to March 31, 2017 if the onshore wind project met the ‘approved development’ grace period eligibility requirements of planning consent, accepted grid connection offer, and land rights all dated no later than September 30, 2015 in the case of direct connection sites, and October 30, 2015 in the case of cluster connection sites. In addition, where applicable, onshore wind projects could access the ‘radar and grid delay’ grace period up to March 31, 2018 and projects eligible for the “investment freezing” grace period and grid/ radar delay grace period were able to accredit up until December 31, 2018. From 2027, it is proposed that fixed-price certificates will be issued, in place of ROCs, to projects qualifying for RO support until the end of the RO regime in 2037. It is currently proposed that fixed-price certificates will be set at the 2027 buyout price, plus 10% and will be inflation-linked. In August 2015, DETI confirmed that the fixed-price certificate scheme will be introduced for the NIRO in 2027, however, a consultation on the detailed design of the fixed- price certificate scheme and the associated legislation has not yet been issued. For projects receiving ROCs, the benefit of the scheme will extend until 2037 to ensure that generation accredited through 2017 receives the full 20 years of support under the NIRO.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Aside from the requirement to meet these targets, the RoI and NI governments are also driven by key economic considerations to increase wind penetration. Ireland has no significant indigenous fossil fuel resources and, as a result, imports its primary fuel sources from the UK and other jurisdictions. Ireland remains one of the most critically dependent EU nations on imported fuel, with 80% of fuel demand imported. Increased generation from renewable sources reduces this reliance on imported fuels.

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Key system constraints considered in the scheduling process,18.11.1,The Merit Order,"Under SEM, the profitability of generators when generating is primarily dependent on demand, the plant’s availability and position in the Merit Order, which ranks available sources of power in ascending order of their short-run marginal cost of production (i.e., the least expensive sources of power are first in the Merit Order). The following table is indicative of the Merit Order between April 2022 and September 2022. _Source: Single Electricity Market Operator data_ ----- The combination of low coal and carbon prices in recent years has resulted in certain coal plants frequently ranking ahead of most CCGT generators (including Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 plants) in the Merit Order. More recently, gas prices have fallen, and coal prices have risen, frequently placing gas plants ahead of coal plants in the Merit Order. Moreover, gas plants which include gas capacity costs in their SEM bids will generally see lower capacity costs in the summer months, when heating demand is lower, improving their competitive position at that time of the year. In the SEM, payments to generators for production are primarily dependent on positions contracted over the ex-ante Energy Markets, rather than on a simple application of the Merit Order by TSO, followed by ex post settlement, which is currently the practice in the SEM. Nevertheless, the Merit Order concept remains significant for determining TSO’s actions in the real-time balancing market. Under SEM, the Merit Order for actions dispatched by TSO in the balancing market will be determined by reference to the price each generation or contracted demand unit would accept to increase or decrease its output or consumption by certain increments, above or below the level such unit contracted at in the ex-ante Energy Markets. Moreover, as the ex-ante Energy Markets divide each generation day into hour or half-hour increments, bids for balancing actions can also vary across the same timescales, leading to hour-by-hour changes in the Merit Order.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Key system constraints considered in the scheduling process,18.11.2,Emergency Market Interventions,"In the second half of 2021, the UK and EU experienced a significant increase in wholesale energy prices (notably gas and consequently electricity) caused by the surge in global energy demand, as most countries emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation was significantly exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 and has led to a series of government and EU interventions designed to capture windfall profits or the surplus revenues of infra-marginal generators for redistribution to consumers. The most relevant of these interventions to the RoI and NI are described below. _RoI_ On September 14, 2022, the European Commission proposed a new Regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices to reduce end user energy bills. It included a temporary revenue cap on non-gas infra-marginal electricity generators and proposed to set the cap at €180/MWh. Regulation 2022/1854 was adopted on October 6, 2022 and contains, among other things, the following provisions: - A temporary market revenue cap of €180/MWh applicable to electricity generated from wind, solar, nuclear, lignite, biomass, waste, oil or peat that applies from 1 December 2022 until June 30, 2023. - Member States are required to ensure that the cap also applies to intermediaries but includes an exemption where it can be demonstrated that surplus revenues are being passed to end consumers. - Member States may set different limits on revenues to differentiate between technologies, apply further limits on electricity traders, or apply higher limits to producers with investments and operating costs greater than €180/MWh. - Member States must ensure that all surplus revenues resulting from the cap are used to finance targeted support for final electricity customers to mitigate the impact of high electricity prices. The Irish Government has decided to implement the cap at a lower price of €120/MWh for both wind and solar generators. In line with the EU guidance the cap has been in place since December 1, 2022 and is expected to expire by June 30, 2023. Legislation in Ireland for implementation of the temporary market revenue cap under the Regulation has yet to be passed. _NI_ On November 17, 2022, the UK government announced that it would be imposing a new temporary Electricity Generator Levy (EGL) of 45% on the extraordinary revenues of low carbon electricity generators. The fundamentals of the EGL are as follows: - It is a tax of 45% on exceptional receipts that groups realize from electricity generation in the UK from renewables, waste and nuclear. ----- - Exceptional receipts are aggregate receipts in a period to the extent in excess of a benchmark price. The EGL is therefore a tax on revenue, rather than profits, and is charged as if it were corporation tax (once all other liabilities and reliefs have been calculated). - The EGL applies to generation from January 1, 2023 to March 31, 2028. - The benchmark price has been set at £75/MWh, which is subject to CPI indexation from April 2024. - The generation threshold, below which a group will not be subject to the EGL has been set at 50GWh/year and the revenue allowance for a group has been set at £10 million/year.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Key system constraints considered in the scheduling process,18.11.3,,"_Source: EirGrid, SONI_ Some of the key system-wide constraints include: - Restrictions to the north-south flow of electricity in both directions across the 275kV transmission line between NI and the RoI; and - Restrictions on the level of non-synchronous generation (primarily wind and interconnector imports) on the system at any given point in time (the System Non-Synchronous Penetration “SNSP”). There are also a number of localized constraints which the TSO applies in order to maintain stability and security of network usage in key load centers and at times of high demand (Source: Weekly Operational Constraints Update). The most important of these are in the Dublin area where the following constraints apply: - Requirement for two of the five large generation units (Huntstown 1 and 2, Dublin Bay and Poolbeg A and B) must be on-load at all times for voltage control; if the East-West Interconnector is not operational then three units must be on load. Typically, this is provided by Huntstown 2 and Dublin Bay in the summer months when system demand is less than 4.0GW; - Requirement for two of four large generation units (Huntstown 1, Dublin Bay and Poolbeg A and B) must be on-load when system demand is greater than 4.0GW for load flow control in the Dublin area. This assumes the East-West Interconnector is available; - Requirement for three of the five large generation units (Huntstown 1 and 2, Dublin Bay and Poolbeg A and B) required for load flow control purposes when system demand is greater than 4.7GW. This assumes the East-West Interconnector is operational. Since December 2014, Huntstown 1 has generally been selected by EirGrid; and - One of Huntstown 1, Huntstown 2 or Dublin Bay is required to be on load at all times for voltage control in the Dublin area. ----- In the context of wind farms, a constraint event occurs when there is insufficient capacity on the network to accept the export of the generator. Access to the transmission network is offered either on a “firm” or “nonfirm” basis depending on whether network reinforcements are required to facilitate the generator’s full export capacity. While a generator which has been granted firm access to the transmission network may experience a reduction in its exported generation at times of high system production, it will receive financial compensation from the TSOs in the form of limited compensation for constrains and, following a recent SEM Committee Decision, curtailment. This decision is currently the subject of a judicial review on the grounds that it is incompatible with EU law and, if successful, the level of compensation available to generators may be significantly increased. A generator with non-firm access may have its exported output reduced without any compensation. Firm access is currently granted once the required investment in the transmission network infrastructure has been completed. Curtailment is a system operation issue and is not linked to the capacity of the network. Curtailment of wind generation occurs where there is excess wind generation available relative to system demand when taking account of system operation restrictions (such as minimum stable generation levels of thermal assets). Curtailment occurs when this excess wind generation cannot be accommodated, and the overall level of renewable generation must be reduced across the system. While the increasing amount of wind generation capacity in Ireland naturally increases the risk of curtailment, the following key developments in the electricity market are expected to provide a countervailing influence: - Provision of a wider range of system services under the evolving DS3 program, provided by a wider range of technologies, is expected to play a key role in operating the power system with SNSP levels up to 95% by 2030 reducing the likelihood of renewable curtailment. - A revised rate of change of frequency limit of 1 Hz/s has been implemented, increasing the resilience of the power system to ride through frequency disturbances caused by significant fluctuations in wind output. - Delivery of enhanced and new integrated control center technologies and tools required to operate the power system securely and efficiently with increasing levels of variable non-synchronous renewables. - Further interconnection and the reintegration of the SEM into EU electricity markets is expected to provide a further outlet for excess wind generation outside of the domestic market.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Since liberalization, the market share of Electric Ireland across all customer classes has fallen, and it has ceded market share to its three main competitors, Energia Group, SSE Airtricity and BGE. Competition has developed at a different pace across the segments. Electric Ireland continues to lead the residential market, although the market is becoming more competitive with an increase in churn rates being observed, resulting in switching both away from Electric Ireland to independent suppliers and between independent suppliers. Between ----- 2009 and December 2021, Electric Ireland’s residential market share dropped from 99% to 45%, caused by market share gains by SSE Airtricity and BGE.

ESB Electric Ireland is also the largest SME supplier with a 35% market share in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, followed by Energia Group with a 31% market share. These market shares have remained relatively stable over the past number of years. The total residential supply market in the RoI is approximately 2.2 million customers for electricity and 0.7 million customers for natural gas as at December 31, 2021. _Natural gas supply_ The natural gas market in the RoI was fully opened to competition on July 1, 2007 and full price deregulation occurred on July 1, 2014. The RoI imports the majority of its natural gas from Great Britain at prices based on the Great Britain National Balancing Point, plus any costs associated with transmission through the natural gas interconnector.

Since liberalization, the market share of Power NI across all customer classes has fallen, and it has ceded market share to its four main competitors, Budget Energy, SSE Airtricity, Go Power and Electric Ireland. Power NI continues to lead the residential market, although Power NI’s residential market share by consumption, dropped from 100% in 2010 to 55% at December 31, 2022, caused by market share gains by SSE Airtricity, Electric Ireland and Budget Energy. Electric Ireland is the largest supplier in the commercial market with 38% market share by consumption at December 31, 2022 followed by Power NI and SSE Airtricity with 26% and 20% respectively. _Natural gas supply_ The NI natural gas market, which relies solely on imported natural gas, is currently divided into three district areas: the greater Belfast area, where natural gas distribution is conducted by Phoenix Natural gas, the Ten Towns area, which encompasses selected major towns outside Belfast, where Firmus Energy holds the distribution license and the “Gas to the West” area, which encompasses towns in the western portion of the province, where West Transmission Limited (part of the Mutual Energy Group) and SGN Natural Gas Limited have conveyance licenses. _Price controls_ Due in part to limited levels of competition, the UR continues to support the market through price regulation. Accordingly, while RoI electricity market prices have been fully deregulated since April 1, 2011, NI’s residential market is still subject to regulation. Power NI and PPB are subject to price controls, defined in formulae set out in Power NI Energy’s electricity supply license, which limit the revenues they may earn and the prices they may charge. The principles of price regulation employed in the relevant license conditions reflect the general duties of the UR and the DfE under the relevant legislation including the need to ensure that licensees are able to finance their authorized activities. Power NI must supply residential electricity at regulated tariffs. The tariffs are currently based on an allowed revenue model, which allows Power NI to recover the UR’s forecast of its operating cost and residual depreciation plus a net margin. The regulatory model has an incentive mechanism by which Power NI is allowed to retain savings achieved through efficiency for at least the period of the price control. If the amount of revenue recovered in any one year exceeds or falls short of the amount allowed by the relevant price control formula, a correction factor (a “K factor”) operates in the following year that requires either a repayment of any surplus with interest or a recovery of any deficit with interest, as appropriate. A surplus is referred to as an over-recovery and a deficit as an under-recovery. In the formulation of its regulated tariffs, Power NI is allowed to pass through to customers all underlying wholesale costs, subject to an economic purchasing obligation. Power NI is required to submit a forecast of all its input costs for each tariff review, which is then subject to review with the UR. Following completion of the review, the new tariffs would apply, with the possibility that they could be changed at the beginning of each quarter if actual costs and revenues do not stay within tolerance (i.e., plus or minus 2.5%). PPB’s price control mechanism provides an entitlement in respect of PPB’s own costs through the receipt of an allowance (effectively a management fee), together with a further amount covering certain depreciation costs, return on PPB’s assets and an allowance in respect of pension deficit costs. The price control also ----- incentivizes PPB through a ‘gain share’ mechanism whereby PPB is entitled to retain a share of any surplus revenues from trading contracted capacity in the SEM or ancillary services payments which exceed the cost of procuring wholesale power under the Ballylumford contract. Under the ‘gain share’ PPB retains 20% of any surplus up to £10 million and 10% of any surplus in excess of £10 million. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.19,BUSINESS Overview,18.19.1,Group activities and reporting segments,"_Renewables_ Renewable energy continues to be a key priority in NI and the RoI and both governments have set targets for increasing the proportion of electricity sourced from renewables. NI’s energy strategy targets the achievement of 80% renewable electricity by 2030 and the RoI Climate Action Plan also sets an 80% renewable electricity target by 2030. As at March 31, 2023, the Renewables segment owns and operates 309MW onshore wind generation assets across the RoI and NI, and has a pipeline of 49MW onshore wind generation assets under construction and 218MW of onshore wind generation assets in development. The Renewables segment also has a pipeline of 628MW of solar PV projects in development, and is currently commissioning a hydrogen electrolyzer onsite at one of its NI onshore wind farms. In addition, the Group is also progressing the development of two offshore wind generation projects off the coast of Ireland totaling up to 1.8GW. The Renewables segment’s operational and inconstruction onshore wind generation assets are outside of the Restricted Group. Similarly, assets in relation to the pipeline of other wind projects and solar PV projects, are also owned by Unrestricted Subsidiaries and therefore outside of the Restricted Group. The Restricted Group received distribution from the unrestricted subsidiaries under the Existing Notes Indenture totaling €61.8 million during Fiscal Year 2023. The Renewables segment also purchases renewable electricity through PPAs covering 1,247MW of operating renewable capacity as at March 31, 2023. Energia Group was the first independent supplier to participate ----- in the deregulated electricity market and an early mover on offering offtake contracts to third parties. Its first renewable PPA was signed in 2002. The Group estimates that it currently represents approximately 21% of the Irish market for Renewable Obligation Certificates (“ROCs”) and Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (“REFIT”) supported wind PPAs. The Renewables segment provides the Energia Group with further access to regulated renewable support mechanisms, with minimal capital requirements and potential upside to the extent of future increases in wholesale power prices, as well as positioning Energia and Power NI as ‘green’ suppliers and enhancing relationships and presence with key stakeholders within the sector. In addition, the Group has a entered into a REFA with Microsoft designed to meet a substantial proportion of their electricity demand in Ireland, whereby the output from the Renewables segment’s pipeline of in-development onshore wind projects (including the 49MW of renewable capacity currently under construction) and solar PV projects are expected to be supported by corporate PPAs with the technology company. Energia Group’s Renewables segment revenue for Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022 was €427.2 million and €401.9 million, respectively, and its Adjusted EBITDA during these periods was €224.5 million and €211.5 million, respectively. _Flexible Generation_ The Flexible Generation segment undertakes trading, regulation and asset management activities on behalf of the Group. This includes the day-to-day operation and commercial optimization of two CCGT plants (Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2) owned by the Group. The two Huntstown CCGTs are highly reliable, flexible and efficient plants, and their strategic location in the constrained Dublin area ensures at least one unit is running on most days of the year. Moreover, the Huntstown plants have the technical capacity to provide system-critical “Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System” (“DS3”) ancillary services, the importance of which has been increasing as the proportion of electricity generated by wind in Ireland has been growing. As at March 31, 2023, Huntstown has a total combined generation capacity of 747MW, which is able to supply approximately 10% of peak demand on an all-island basis (based on estimated peak demand of approximately 7,700MW). We believe that the two Huntstown CCGTs are critical to the security of electricity supply in the Dublin area. Under the Single Electricity Market (“SEM”), the Huntstown plants sell the generated energy into the Day-Ahead (“DAM”), Intra-Day (“IDM”) and Balancing Mechanism (“BM”) markets and sell capacity several years in advance via ‘Reliability Options’ as part of the Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (“CRM”). The Reliability Options have been awarded to the Group’s Huntstown plants for the current and next four capacity years, and include a clearing price of €83,050/MW for the capacity year 2026 to 2027. See also “Industry—The _All-Island Single Electricity Market—Energy Trading Arrangements—Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM).” Huntstown sells energy at the market clearing prices in the DAM and IDM as well as receive (or in some_ cases make) other payments for energy through constraint payments in the BM. The Huntstown plants also receive payments associated with DS3 ancillary services. The Group has also recently developed and commissioned a 50MW battery storage project in NI which is operated and traded by the Flexible Generation business. The project has been awarded a 10-year capacity contract commencing in the capacity year 2022/2023, at a clearing price of £78,600/MW for 8.15MW of its 11.3MW derated capacity. The Group plans to develop a further pipeline of battery storage projects, which we expect will strengthen the Group’s position for future capacity auctions and provide an additional source for ancillary revenue. The Group has also entered into a contract with EirGrid to provide 50MW of emergency gas generation located at the Huntstown site for a duration of three years, extendible by EirGrid to five years. Construction of this emergency gas generation project commenced in December 2022 and is planned to be completed by the end of 2023. The Group is developing a 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin. The proposed data center has a grid connection offer and the lands necessary for the project have been acquired. Planning consent for the data center was received in April 2022 but the decision was appealed and the planning application is currently being considered by An Bord Pleanála, RoI’s national independent planning body. The Group expects _An Bord Pleanála to issue its decision in the near term and does not believe that there are grounds on which_ planning permission should be refused. The Group has entered into a contract with an international hyperscale technology company for a long term lease by it of the electrical infrastructure, buildings and integrated equipment at the data center. Capital expenditure in respect of the development of the data center was €20.0 million in Fiscal Year 2023 and €11.1 million in Fiscal Year 2022, primarily, in respect of land and development of electrical connections. Going forward, the Flexible Generation segment’s investment in the proposed data center in respect ----- of the development of the data halls is expected to be an unrestricted investment and therefore outside of the Restricted Group. Investment in respect of the purchase of land, the design and build of all the high voltage electrical infrastructure (including a gas insulated substation and high voltage transformer switchyard) will be within the Restricted Group. The Flexible Generation segment also includes the Group’s PPB business which administers 600MW of contracted generation capacity from the Ballylumford power station in NI, which is subject to price control and entitles it to an allowance (effectively a management fee). This legacy PPB contract will expire in September 2023 in accordance with its terms. The PPB contract generated €14.6 million, €8.5 million and €9.3 million of EBITDA during the Fiscal Year 2023, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2021, respectively. For Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022, Flexible Generation generated €1,769.7 million and €989.5 million in revenue, respectively, and €204.7 million and €104.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, based on, or after taking into account the adjustments for over/under recovery against, the regulated entitlement of PPB. _Customer Solutions_ The Group’s Customer Solutions business operates under the Energia and Power NI brands. Energia Energia is a price control unregulated retail supply business, which supplies electricity and natural gas to residential and business customers in the RoI. Business customers include LEU and SME customers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Energia supplied electricity to 14% of the LEU market, 30% of the SME market and 12% of the residential market in the RoI in terms of consumption. As part of its hedging strategy, the Group’s Flexible Generation segment undertakes wholesale electricity, natural gas, carbon and green certificate trading activities on behalf of the Customer Solutions segment. Power NI Power NI is the incumbent electricity supplier in NI, supplying electricity primarily to residential customers. While the residential electricity supply market in NI is open to competition, Power NI remains the biggest supplier with a 55.0% market share of residential supply in terms of consumption during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. As a result, Power NI is still regarded as the dominant supplier and is therefore subject to price regulation. As a regulated business, Power NI is subject to price control which permits it to recover an allowance calculated by reference to its forecasted operating costs at the time of the relevant price control, plus an allowed margin based on a percentage of forecasted regulated revenue. On January 26, 2023, the UR confirmed the extension of the existing price control (which applies in respect to residential customers) to March 31, 2025. In addition, Power NI supplies electricity to business customers in the unregulated market and secures additional revenues through off-take from certain contracted smaller scale third party renewable generators (which are reported through the Renewables segment). In addition, the Customer Solutions business also offers energy efficiency services and car charging solutions to its customers across Ireland. For Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2022, Customer Solutions generated €2,345.2 million and €1,780.1 million in revenue, respectively, and a loss of €162.1 million and €115.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, based on, or after taking into account the adjustments for over/under recovery against, the regulated entitlement of Power NI.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In line with the Group’s decarbonization strategy, the Renewables business has expanded in recent years and now has a substantial pipeline of additional onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (“PV”) development projects and has also entered into a renewable energy framework agreement (“REFA”) with Microsoft, which is designed to meet a substantial proportion of their electricity demand in Ireland. The Renewables business is also currently commissioning a hydrogen electrolyzer onsite at one of its NI onshore wind farms and is progressing the development of two offshore wind generation projects off the coast of Ireland totaling up to 1.8GW. The Flexible Generation business owns and operates 747MW of conventional gas-fired generation assets in the RoI and procures power under contract with 600MW of conventional generation assets in NI, in each case, as at March 31, 2023. In addition, under the Flexible Generation business, the Group is currently undertaking the following key initiatives: - 50MW battery storage project in NI, which has been recently commissioned; - 50MW emergency gas generation project under a contract with EirGrid that is currently under construction and is planned to be commissioned by the end of 2023; and - a 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin, which is currently under development. The Customer Solutions business supplies electricity or gas to a total of 828,300 customer sites across Ireland, comprising 311,700 customer sites in the RoI and 516,600 customer sites in NI, as at March 31, 2023, through its two retail brands, Energia and Power NI. With a digitally-enabled customer-centric focus, the business also offers energy efficiency services and car charging solutions to its customers across Ireland.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.20,Competitive strengths,18.20.1,"Vertically integrated energy business with growing, predictable and resilient cash flows","Energia Group is a leading vertically integrated energy business active in the energy market across NI and the RoI. The Group enjoys strong strategic positioning in each of its business segments, with revenue generation in each underpinned by one or more of: regulatory support, pro-renewable energy policies, a contracted nature, or a comparative/structural advantage. In particular, Energia Group’s EBITDA is supported by strong regulatory underpinnings. For instance, REFIT supported PPAs in the RoI provide a floor on price per unit of electricity sold, and eligible renewable generators such as our Group receive ROCs for each MWh of electricity generated and consumed within NI (or used in a permitted way), which are freely tradable at auctions and can be ----- sold to suppliers throughout the UK. Furthermore, Power NI Energy is subject to regulated price controls in respect of its residential customer base and its current price control runs to March 31, 2025. Additional factors that should further underpin the Group’s earning resilience include, a long-term lease arrangement with an international hyperscale technology company in respect of the proposed 165MW data center at the Group’s Huntstown campus, corporate PPAs through the REFA with Microsoft, which is expected to support the pipeline of 218MW of onshore wind projects in development and the five-year hydrogen gas purchase agreement with Translink. The Group has a strong track record of resilience through turbulent market conditions. In particular, the Group demonstrated resilient performance through the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and despite their impact on the commodity environment, the Group’s EBITDA has continued to grow such that the Group’s Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA (excluding distribution from Unrestricted Subsidiaries) for Fiscal Year 2021, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2023, was €150.2 million, €121.0 million and €177.6 million, respectively. We believe that our sustained EBITDA growth is driven by our high-quality asset bases, the Group’s vertically integrated business model and credit enhancing investments. Moreover, Energia Group’s vertically integrated structure (comprising supply activities as well as both renewable and thermal electricity generation) provides a natural hedge against volatility in wholesale electricity prices to the extent that the dispatch of the Huntstown plants and the generation of the renewable generation portfolio offsets exposure to retail supply contracts sold. For example, the annual average of electricity purchased for supply by the Energia Group from Fiscal Year 2021 to Fiscal Year 2023 was 6.1TWh, and the annual average of electricity generated and sold by the Energia Group during the same period was 6.2TWh.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Strong growth in demand for energy is expected across Ireland, particularly driven by population growth, development of data centers in the Dublin region and the electrification of heat and transport across Ireland (Source: Ireland Capacity Outlook). In particular, the Irish system continues to face a potential supply deficit, with capacity shortfall particularly prevalent in Dublin given rapid growth in large energy users and Dublin’s electricity system remains constrained in the medium-term. We believe that given its strategic positioning in each of its business segments, the Group is well positioned to benefit from these market factors in the Irish Market. The island of Ireland enjoys some of the best wind resources in Europe. Renewable energy continues to be a key priority in NI and the RoI and both governments have each set targets for increasing the proportion of electricity sourced from renewables. NI targets achieving 80% renewable electricity by 2030 and the RoI Climate Action Plan also sets an 80% renewable electricity target by 2030. In addition, NI has adopted a “Path to Net Zero Energy” policy, which aims at 48% reduction in net CO2 emissions by 2030 (as compared to 1990). In light of these policies, the governments in Ireland support investment in renewable sources and which in turn strongly supports the Energia Group expansion in the renewables sector in Ireland. In addition, we believe our continued endeavors in renewable energy development will effectively align with and address the stronger investor demand and expectations surrounding ESG commitments.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.20,Competitive strengths,18.20.3,Extensive Renewables assets and PPA portfolio complemented by system-critical Flexible Generation,"In light of the NI and RoI governments’ targets, and in line with its own strategy to build on and diversify its platform of renewable assets to accelerate low carbon growth and increase earnings, Energia Group, through its Renewables segment, has successfully built-out its onshore wind farm portfolio. Its operational owned onshore wind farm capacity has increased from 9MW as at March 31, 2014 to 309MW as at March 31, 2023. The Group currently has 49MW of onshore wind farm capacity under construction supported by a corporate PPA and a further pipeline of 218MW of onshore wind projects in development which are expected to be supported by corporate PPAs with Microsoft. In addition, the Group has a strong presence in the renewables market as a PPA provider to third party wind farms, with 1.2GW of capacity contracted as at March 31, 2023. The Group is a leading developer and operator of renewable energy across the island of Ireland and supplies 21% of renewable electricity in Ireland through 15 onshore operational and wholly-owned wind farms Huntstown 1 and 2 are flexible CCGT plants, benefiting from high efficiency and low CO2 emissions, as well as a strategic location on the outskirts of Dublin. Dublin and the surrounding area represents the highest concentration of customer demand in Ireland, which is expected to grow significantly in the coming years in the context of general economic growth as well as the significant expansion in data center capacity that is projected for the Dublin region (Source: Ireland Capacity Outlook). The Dublin area is also presently characterized by a ----- high level of electricity system constraints. Such system constraints include, for example, voltage control, in which generation is required in a particular area of the electrical system to support local voltage, or load flow control, in which generation is required to enable the efficient flow of electricity. Energia Group’s plants are critical to the security of energy supply and system stability in Dublin and the surrounding area due to existing electricity system constraints, and as such receive energy payments not only based on market clearing prices set on the basis of an “unconstrained” (“in merit”) dispatch (i.e. in a theoretical world where no restrictions or physical limitations on dispatching such electricity exist), but also constraint payments, designed to compensate the plants when they get dispatched “out of merit.” Energia Group’s CCGTs are frequently dispatched “out of merit,” and at any time, at least one of the plants is typically running either ‘in merit’ or on a “constrained” basis to ensure system stability. See “Industry—Generation—Network infrastructure, _constraints and curtailment.”_ The Huntstown plants also receive capacity payments under Reliability Options acquired through the Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (“CRM”). The CRM was established by the regulatory authorities as part of the SEM design to provide an incentive to generators to invest in building and maintaining generation capacity. Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 are modern CCGT plants, which the Group believes are among the most reliable conventional plants in Ireland, as evidenced by their high availability levels since being commissioned, with both plants achieving lifetime availability levels of approximately 92%. The Group believes that Huntstown 1 and 2 will continue to benefit from revenues under the CRM due to the overall need for capacity in the SEM and Huntstown plants system-critical role in alleviating the localized constraints in the Dublin area. As at March 31, 2023, both Huntstown plants have secured Reliability Options under CRM auctions for each capacity year to September 30, 2027, being the latest year for which Reliability Options have yet been awarded. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors affecting _results of operations—Capacity and availability.”_ In addition, as flexible and responsive generators, Huntstown 1 and 2 receive certain payments in return for the provision to the system operator of ancillary services necessary for the secure operation of the electricity system. We believe that these services (including operating reserve, reactive power, replacement reserve, synchronous inertial reserve, fast frequency response, ramping margins and fast post-fault active power recovery) are becoming particularly important as the proportion of electricity generated from wind increases in the Irish energy market, with some models suggesting more than 14GW of wind generation capacity to be connected to the grid by 2030 as part of the RoI and NI governments’ endeavors to meet their renewable targets (Source: Ireland Capacity Outlook). Wind is an intermittent and non-synchronous technology, and power demand on the island varies throughout both the day and the year, giving rise to transmission system supply and frequency imbalances. Energia Group’s CCGTs have the technical capability to provide ancillary services under DS3, meaning they are well-positioned to benefit from system service payments.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In NI, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Power NI remained the biggest residential electricity supplier and had a 55.0% market share in terms of consumption, in a market where the total consumption was 2.855TWh (Source: QREMM Reports). In the NI business supply market, where the total consumption was 4.639TWh, Power NI was the third largest supplier with a market share of 26.0% by consumption for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (Source: QREMM Reports). Although the market share of Power NI across all customer classes has fallen since market liberalization, its EBITDA contribution has remained stable, underpinned by the form of Power NI’s current price control, which runs to March 31, 2025, and fixes 70% of its regulated allowance with the remainder variable based on customer numbers, thus limiting the impact of customer attrition on Power NI’s results. The Group believes that Power NI is well-positioned for the future, irrespective of the continuation of its regulated status, as its efficient operations, strong brand awareness and excellent customer service represent significant competitive advantages vis-à-vis other players in the market. While the NI residential supply market has been open to competition since 2007, when Power NI held 100% of the market, Power NI has been able to maintain its competitive advantages and retain strong market share. Power NI generates further revenues through its strong presence in the deregulated business customer segment of the market and through certain smaller scale contracted renewable PPAs. ----- In the RoI, where the total consumption in the business electricity and gas markets was 19.801TWh and 13.987TWh, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Energia had 14.0% and 30.0% market shares, by volume of the LEU and SME business electricity supply segments, respectively, and 14.0% and 13.2% shares of the LEU and SME natural gas supply segments, respectively, making Energia the second largest electricity and fourth largest gas supplier to business customers by volume (Source: Energy and Water Monitoring Report). Energia has a diversified customer base, with a particular focus on single and multi-site SMEs, which we believe represents the most profitable market segment. Energia entered the RoI residential supply market in January 2014. Leveraging the low cost-to-serve billing and customer service platform of Power NI, Energia now serves 280,832 residential sites as at December 31, 2021, including single fuel (electricity or gas) and dual-fuel (electricity and gas) customers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Energia held a 12% share of the RoI residential electricity market and 11% share of the residential gas supply market, where the total consumption was 9.381TWh and 7.723TWh, respectively (Source: Energy and Water Monitoring Report). Digitalization remains a priority and the Group continues to progress its development of innovative, enhanced and differentiated product offerings to customers. Accordingly, the Group has invested in the development of a ‘digital IQ’ platform to allow customers greater access and transparency, thereby accelerating the shift to zero carbon. From advanced billing to smart EV charging, the ‘digital IQ’ platform will empower the Group to provide a more efficient and personalized service to its customers.

During the period from fiscal year 2017 to Fiscal Year 2023, the Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA has increased by a CAGR of 10.0%, and during this period, due to the Restricted Group’s low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, Restricted Group’s cash conversion (defined as Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA less Restricted Group capital expenditure, divided by Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA), has averaged 80.8% (Fiscal Year 2021: 86.7%, Fiscal Year 2022: 70.6%, Fiscal Year 2023: 85.2%). Restricted Group capital expenditure excludes capital expenditure on the Group’s data center and offshore wind strategic projects and includes deferred income received in relation to the emergency generation project. Over the last three Fiscal Years, Restricted Group Adjusted EBITDA has averaged €178.9 million, the Restricted Group capital expenditure has averaged €32.5 million. This strong performance has historically also benefitted from diligent and timely management of baddebt levels in the Customer Solutions businesses. This was achieved through proactive credit management, including a focus on creditworthiness at the time of customer acquisition, and the use of prepayment meters and direct debit plans. For Fiscal Year 2023, approximately 35.4% of Power NI’s customers paid using prepayment meters and direct debit payment plans covered approximately 92.0% and a further 39.0% of Energia’s and Power NI’s customers, respectively.

The Group’s proposed 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin will benefit from a twentyyear lease term contract with the end user, which is an international hyperscale technology company. The technology company has leased the electrical infrastructure, buildings and integrated equipment (the powered shell) from the Group and has the option to further extend the lease by two five-year periods. The data center is strategically located, adjoining the existing Huntstown power station campus, which enables the Group to maximize profitability from auto producer benefits by co-locating power generation and electricity consumption at the same site. In addition, the end user would pre-fund the construction of the first two phases of the data center and payment from the Group to the end user would be due only at completion. Going forward, the development ----- and construction of the data halls is expected to be financed pursuant to ring-fenced project finance arrangements, entered into by Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and hence outside of the Restricted Group.

Electricity from generators with a maximum export capacity greater than 10MW is purchased by Energia or Power NI but is then required to be sold into the SEM, while electricity purchased from generators with a maximum export capacity of less than 10MW may be sold directly by Energia or Power NI to customers without being sold into the SEM. The Renewables business provides independent wind farm developers with bankable and competitive PPAs, and generally remain in effect for 15 or, for NI, 20 years, reflecting the financing period required for wind farm investments. Since both of the RoI and NI regulatory regimes have been put in place, Energia Group has been offering PPAs to renewable generators and, based upon its market share, has built a reputation for being competitive and competent. PPAs are used by developers in their financing process and over the years Energia Group has assisted a large number of independent developers to finance their growing portfolio of wind farms. This has given Energia Group a strong position in the off-take market. The Renewables PPA business generates a margin on the sale of energy produced by renewable generators without requiring the Energia Group to make an investment of capital or to use significant incremental resources for their administration. Margin generated by this business is broadly dependent on sales price (in particular the SMP), PPA wind farm capacity, PPA wind farm day-to-day productivity (or load factor) and PPA agreement terms. The RoI agreements have historically been based on a fixed price, whereas some of the newer PPAs include a variable price element. The NI PPA agreements are for the most part variably priced, often with a floor price. Load factors are highly variable due to their dependence on sufficient wind for operation. The Renewables business has access to renewable support mechanisms (REFIT in the RoI and the ROC scheme in NI), in respect of the majority of its capacity, as set out below: - **REFIT: Under REFIT, suppliers are compensated if the SEM market price, including constraint payments achieved for electricity generated and capacity payments earned by a particular renewable generating unit in a calendar year, is below a base reference price. The reference price is indexed annually (upwards only) at the CPI, and in 2023 is set at a floor of €78.356/MWh for large scale wind generation and €81.105/MWh for smaller scale wind generators. Suppliers like Energia Group claim any shortfall between the market and the floor prices in any annual period from a PSO Levy pot of funds, funded by customers, set aside and administered by the CRU. Suppliers are also compensated for the cost of balancing renewable generation at a fixed rate per MWh generated (being €11.754/MWh for 2023) for REFIT1 and up to €9.90/MWh (not indexed) for REFIT2 and REFIT3 depending on the extent to which the market revenues exceed the applicable reference price. REFIT1 closed to capacity operational after December 2013 and was replaced by REFIT2 (Onshore wind, hydro and biomass landfill gas) and REFIT3 (Biomass Technologies). REFIT2 and REFIT3 are, as at December 31, 2015, closed to new application. ----- - **NIRO regime: NI has established the NIRO, which requires electricity suppliers to source a targeted percentage of supplied electricity from renewable sources, and any shortfall must be satisfied by either paying a buyout fee (£59.01/MWh in 2023/24) or purchasing ROCs. Eligible renewable generators, such as Energia Group, are granted free ROCs, which can be traded across the UK independent of the electricity to which they relate. As at March 31, 2023, the generation capacity of the Group’s renewable projects supported by the ROC and REFIT schemes amounted to 173MW and 136MW, respectively. As at the same date, the operating capacity of the Group’s renewable PPA portfolio supported by the ROC and REFIT schemes accounted for 51% and 48%, respectively, of the Group’s total operating capacity. _Certain key PPA performance indicators_ As at March 31, 2023, the Renewables segment had operational PPA agreements in respect of 1,247MW of renewable generation capacity across the RoI and NI, of which 870MW were held with third-party wind farm generators, 68MW with other renewable generators and 309MW with the Group’s operational onshore wind assets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.38,Gross capacity,18.38.2,Operational performance of the Huntstown plants,"Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 are modern CCGT plants and, in the Group’s view, among the most reliable conventional plants in Ireland, as evidenced by their high availability levels since being commissioned, with both plants achieving lifetime availability levels of approximately 92%. Furthermore, thermal efficiency and output levels achieved at both plants have been in line with management’s expectations. The Group expects to maintain high availability levels for the system-critical Huntstown CCGT plants located on the outskirts of Dublin. The plants both have low minimum stable generation levels thereby giving a wide operational range. The Group believes that their location, their high availability and their low minimum generation levels increases the attractiveness of the Huntstown plants to the TSO, allowing it to use the plants to accommodate a broad range of variability in wind generation. Unconstrained utilization for Huntstown 1 decreased to 63.9% for Fiscal Year 2023 from 65.5% for Fiscal Year 2022 and unconstrained utilization for Huntstown 2 increased to 73.0% for Fiscal Year 2023 from 44.0% for Fiscal Year 2022. Unconstrained utilization rates at the Huntstown units reflect levels of generation from renewables, the availability of other gas plant and the relative prices of coal vs. gas plant (including the cost ----- of carbon dioxide emissions allowances). Coal plants on the island of Ireland are expected to close between 2024 and 2025 (as noted in the Ireland Capacity Outlook 2022-2031 published by EirGrid and SONI). Due to a number of factors, the TSOs are not able to align the unconstrained schedule with the plant needed to ensure demand and supply are met in real time across all portions of the grid. Sometimes there are general, system-wide reasons for this, such as an unexpected plant outage; however, often this is due to regional constraints faced by the Irish electricity grid. Some constraints on the Irish system include those governing power flows between the RoI and NI, the need for a minimum amount of units to be running in a particular area and the need to enforce limits on generation output to support voltage. The Huntstown plants are part of the Dublin constraint group, which requires keeping on two out of the five Dublin-area thermal generators at all times to manage voltage control. As a result, one of the Huntstown plants regularly is called upon to operate even if it is not in the SEM unconstrained schedule. The Huntstown thermal plants have realized consistent unconstrained utilization rates throughout the three-year period, except that Huntstown 2 experienced a significant outage during Fiscal Year 2022. Given that the Group operates its generation plants in the unconstrained market, constrained operations have been (on a net basis) relatively minor. However, constrained utilization is essential to support the grid within the Dublin region. The incremental impact of constrained utilization for Huntstown 1 was an increase of 4.1% for Fiscal Year 2023 and an increase of 0.9% for Fiscal Year 2022, and for Huntstown 2 there was a decrease of 11.4% for Fiscal Year 2023 and a decrease of 0.4% for Fiscal Year 2022.

Huntstown 1 distillate fuel oil tank is due a 20-year inspection and the plant will be unavailable to operate on secondary fuel for approximately 6 months of fiscal year 2024. The plants can switch to distillate oil if natural gas is unavailable. While such a switch would reduce the efficiency of the plants, the Energia Group would only do so if it was commercially advantageous or if instructed to do so by the system operator. Energia Group supplies the plants with natural gas purchased under flexible purchasing agreements that do not have any minimum specified volumes. Prices under these agreements benefit from reduced transportation costs or are discounted to published market prices. Prices can be fixed, or natural gas can be purchased at spot prices, depending on Energia Group’s hedging strategies and the requirements of its retail customers. Distillate oil is provided by various suppliers. Natural gas capacity is required to move natural gas into (entry capacity) and out of (exit capacity) the Irish natural gas system. Energia Group’s trading team, on behalf of the plants and the retail supply position, optimizes the capacity bookings required across the retail and generation position on an annual, monthly and daily basis. The tariffs for this capacity (sold by Gas Networks Ireland) are regulated and set annually. Capacity requirements for the power plant are generally largely met through annual capacity purchases or trades. Energia Group also trades entry capacity in a secondary market with a number of counterparties enabling the purchase of additional capacity at prices below the regulated tariffs and the sale of capacity during periods of excess (for instance during summer periods of low demand).",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

As at March 31, 2023, PPB held contracts for 600MW of generation capacity with Ballylumford. The UR has kept the overall benefit of these contracts under review from a policy and economic perspective but as the contracts have been profitable, with significant surpluses returned to NI customers, the contracts will remain in force until their natural expiry date in September 2023.

PPB also offers CfDs to SEM participants and sells ancillary services (DS3), such as operational reserve and voltage support, to SONI under DS3 contracts. PPB is subject to price controls and regulations administered by the UR. The applicable price control mechanism provides an entitlement in respect of PPB’s own costs through the receipt of an allowance (effectively a management fee), together with a further amount covering certain depreciation costs, return on PPB’s assets and an allowance in respect of pension deficit costs. The price control also incentivizes PPB through a ‘gain share’ mechanism whereby PPB is entitled to retain a share of any surplus revenues from trading the contracted capacity in the SEM or ancillary services payments which exceed the cost of procuring wholesale power under the Ballylumford contract. Under the ‘gain share’ PPB retains 20% of any surplus up to £10 million and 10% of any surplus in excess of £10 million. If the revenue that PPB receives from the SEM pool and through the sale of ancillary services is insufficient to cover its total costs incurred under the PPAs (e.g., availability payments and energy payments, among others), any shortfall can be recovered via PSO Levies collected by NIEN from suppliers and passed on to customers. Conversely, PPB is also required to return any surplus revenue it receives. Electricity and natural gas price volatility is hedged through CfDs based on the SMP and through commodity hedging. ----- PPB’s current price control runs to the cessation of the business in September 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.43,Availability,18.43.9,Emergency gas generation,"In the All-Island Generation Capacity Statement, EirGrid identified a generation capacity shortfall of 1,050MW in 2023-24 and 1,850MW in 2024-25. This capacity shortfall is particularly prevalent in Dublin which has experienced the rapid growth in large energy users connecting to the grid and underinvestment in new generation capacity in recent years. To mitigate the risk of blackouts EirGrid selected the Group’s Huntstown Power Station as a preferred site to develop 50MW of temporary generation to maintain security of supply for the national electricity system. The project is of strategic national importance and the relevant development consent for the project was granted by An Bord Pleanála, RoI’s national independent planning body, to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications to be developed for Winter 2023. Once developed the Group will be required to operate and maintain this new emergency generation for up to 5 years while EirGrid waits for new conventional generation to be commissioned through the annual T-4 capacity market auctions. The contract with EirGrid to provide the emergency generation is for a duration of three years, extendible by EirGrid to five years. The contract entitles the Group to a development fee on achievement of certain milestones and an ongoing annual facilitation fee (subject to indexation) To deliver this project Energia Group has partnered with Aggreko for the supply and installation of generators and electrical balance of plant, Adman as the main civil contractor and Mott MacDonald as lead technical advisor.

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.43,Availability,18.43.10,Data center,"The Group is progressing the development of a 165MW data center at its Huntstown campus in Dublin. The proposed development has been strategically located to adjoin the existing Huntstown power station campus to maximize the savings available from net settlement and avoidance of maximum import capacity (“MIC”) network charges (MIC capacity and losses) and supplier imperfections charges when co-locating power generation and electricity consumption on the same site. The site location also benefits due to its proximity to the wider electricity transmission system, high speed fiber links, water connection and transport links. In addition, due to the ambient climate in Ireland, the data halls in the proposed development will be air cooled by free air cooling for the majority of the time thus minimizing power and water consumption requirements. The proposal comprises two data center buildings arranged over three stories together with associated infrastructure including a gas insulated high voltage substation and water treatment facility. Energia Group’s approach to the development has been to deliver all the underlying requirements needed for the development to proceed. Following agreements being put in place, the campus and buildings have been designed as part of a multi-disciplinary process in conjunction with the data center end user, a global technology company. The proposed data center has both grid and water connection offers and the lands necessary for the project have been acquired. Works to remove existing overhead power lines that traverse the proposed site are at an advanced stage. Planning consent for the proposed data center was received in April 2022 but the decision was appealed and the planning application is currently being considered by _An Bord Pleanála, RoI’s national independent planning body. The Group expects An Bord Pleanála to issue its decision in the near term and does not believe that there are grounds on which planning permission should be refused. The Group’s development strategy has focused on its core areas of expertise. Energia Group will be responsible for the design and build of all the high voltage electrical infrastructure including a gas insulated substation and the high voltage transformer switchyard. The end user, which is an international hyperscale technology company, will design and construct the data center buildings and integrated equipment on behalf of the Group. The end user will then be responsible for any further mechanical or electrical fit out works requirement ----- as well as any IT equipment. The end user has leased the electrical infrastructure, buildings and integrated equipment (powered shell) from the Group, based on a fixed price (indexed annually) initially for a twenty-year term but with the option to extend by a further two five-year periods. The lease is a full repairing and insuring lease (often referred to as triple net lease). The lease passes responsibility of maintenance and other property costs such as rates to the end user.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.44,Customer Solutions,18.44.1,Energia,"Energia Customer Solutions’ electricity and natural gas supply customer base in the RoI is split into three specific segments, LEUs, SMEs and Residential. LEUs are mainly large industrial and commercial users while SMEs represent the middle and small business segments, and include the services sector, central and local government and small industrial premises. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Energia supplied electricity to 14% of the LEU market, 30% of the SME market and 12% of the residential market in the RoI in terms of consumption (Source: Energy and Water Monitoring Report). Competition in the LEU and SME segments in the RoI is relatively mature as both markets have been open to competition for a number of years and there are no regulated tariffs in these segments. Competition in the RoI residential market is well established with the electricity market open since February 2005 and full deregulation since October 2010. Energia entered the RoI residential electricity markets in January 2014 with what the Company believes to be a price-leading dual fuel strategy and has established a position as one of the key players in the residential switching market. Key sales routes to market have been established and end to end mass market paperless registration systems have been implemented. Energia purchases the majority of its electricity from the SEM pool, with the remainder coming from generators with capacity of less than 10MW who are not required to sell through the SEM pool. Although Energia does not directly purchase electricity from the Group’s Huntstown power plants, the fact that the Energia Group both supplies into, and purchases from, the SEM pool provides the Energia Group with a natural hedge against price spikes or when other generators are on outage or when wind output falls. ----- _Natural gas supply_ In 2005, Energia entered the natural gas supply market as part of a dual fuel strategy to improve customer retention levels and capture a higher combined electricity and natural gas margin per customer. Energia provides natural gas supply to its LEU and SME customers, including a number of leading multinational corporations and public sector entities as well as its Residential customers in the RoI. It also supplies natural gas to the Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 plants at the market price. Energia sources the majority of its natural gas supply requirements from three major suppliers, pursuant to flexible purchasing agreements, with no minimum specified volumes. Prices under these agreements can be fixed, or natural gas can be purchased at spot prices, depending on Energia Group’s hedging strategies and the requirements of its retail customers. _Sales and marketing_ The Customer Solutions sales team is organized to match customer segments rather than by geographic location. The team comprises a LEU customer team, a SME customer team, an independent team of approximately 10 sales agents focused on the SME segment, and a market support team with energy efficiency and marketing expertise. The LEU team has five key account managers dealing with all major sites in the RoI, which, for the purposes of the LEU market, include the four regions of North, Dublin, Midlands and South. The SME sales team is organized into separate customer segments to deal with multi-site accounts (such as retailers and governmental bodies) and comprises a core dedicated team, with an additional network of independent sales agents throughout the RoI who are paid on a commission only basis. The residential sales team is organized to manage various sales channels to the mass consumer market. The key routes to market include independent sales agents, price comparison websites, direct website, affinity deals and telesales. A residential sales manager is responsible for managing a network of independent sales teams, which are controlled through Energia Customer Solutions’ territory management system with automated registration handheld units for the team of approximately 45 sales staff. A marketing team of 31 has responsibility for product development and brand activity across all the routes to the residential and commercial market. _Certain key performance indicators_ The table below sets out the electricity sales for Customer Solutions for Fiscal Year 2021, Fiscal Year 2022 and Fiscal Year 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

While the residential electricity supply market in NI is open to competition, Power NI remains the biggest supplier with a 55.0% market share in terms of consumption during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. As a result, Power NI is still regarded as the dominant supplier and is therefore subject to price regulation. As a regulated business, Power NI is subject to a price control which permits it to recover an allowance calculated by reference to its forecasted operating costs at the time of the relevant price control, plus an allowed margin based on a percentage of forecasted regulated revenue. On January 26, 2023, the UR confirmed the extension of the existing price control (which applies in respect to residential customers) to March 31, 2025. In addition, Power NI supplies electricity to certain business customers in the unregulated market and secures additional revenues through off-take from certain contracted smaller scale renewable PPAs. Power NI purchases the majority of its wholesale requirements from the SEM markets and hedges its exposure to pool price volatility through a combination of CfDs with generators, proxy hedges and tariffs partially or fully indexed to reference markets for certain larger customers. Power NI has a natural gas supply license and the capability to enter the NI natural gas supply market should it choose to do so. If a decision is made to enter the natural gas supply market, Power NI proposes to leverage its efficient cost base, strong track record for customer service and the natural gas retail systems currently supporting domestic natural gas retail operations in RoI. Natural gas retail margin headroom is monitored together with developments in retail price regulation in the NI natural gas market (including the prospect of greater deregulation). Should a decision be made to enter the market it will be underpinned by a robust business case. _Certain key performance indicators_ The table below sets out NI residential and non-residential electricity customer sites for Power NI as at March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In the NI business supply market, Power NI was the third largest supplier with a market share of 26.0% by consumption for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (Source: QREMM Reports). _Price controls_ Power NI is subject to price controls and regulations administered by the UR. From April 1, 2017 the price control only applies to residential customers. Power NI’s current price control runs from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2025. The current price control is an extension of the previous price control, with Power NI agreeing with the UR the inclusion of additional passthrough provisions to facilitate pass-through of additional operating costs expected to be incurred in certain specific areas. ----- Power NI is currently able to recover an allowance historically calculated by reference to its operating costs, plus an allowed margin of 2.2% based on a percentage of forecast regulated revenue. Furthermore, the form of Power NI’s price control formula ensures 70% of its regulated allowance is fixed, with the remainder variable based on customer numbers, which has the effect of limiting the impact of customer attrition on Power NI’s results. This regulatory model also includes an incentive mechanism by which Power NI is able to retain savings achieved through improved efficiency. In formulating its regulated tariffs, Power NI is able to pass through to its customers all underlying wholesale charges, including use of system costs, levies and renewable obligations costs, as well as costs associated with the economic procurement of generation capacity. _Hedging_ Energia Group’s hedging activities are carried out by its trading teams in Energia and Power NI. The trading teams utilize a variety of hedging tools, including financial and physical natural gas contracts, financial power contracts along with carbon and foreign exchange trades (which along with natural gas, are the primary drivers of variable generation costs in the SEM). Energia Group’s trading and hedging activities are governed by a risk governance framework approved by the Energia Group’s management board. Trading and hedging activities are monitored by an Energia Group’s risk management committee and the Energia Group’s risk governance committee that meet, weekly and fortnightly, respectively, and the Energia Group’s management board that meets monthly. The Energia Group trading team’s role also includes the commercial optimization of the Huntstown plants in the I-SEM markets. Both Energia and Power NI have hedging policies to hedge their exposure to changes in the price of ISEM power in line with retail electricity sales contracts. The strategy adopted varies by customer type and can be summarized as follows: - LEU and large SME group customers are priced on variable tariffs and no specific hedging is undertaken unless a customer’s specific request for a fixed price tariff is agreed to by Energia or Power NI. Where an LEU customer requests a fixed price, Energia and Power NI will provide a fixed price via the hedging of gas, carbon and GB power prices as a proxy for I-SEM power prices. - Energia’s SME customers’ demand is either aggregated and hedged monthly on a rolling basis or priced on a pool pass-through basis. - Power NI SME customers are priced on a pool pass-through basis. RoI residential customers’ demand is aggregated and hedged monthly on a rolling basis. In respect of NI residential customers, Power NI’s price control allows it to pass through the costs of wholesale electricity subject to compliance with its economic purchasing obligation, which it discharges by hedging wholesale electricity prices in line with policies agreed with the UR. Energia adopts a similar strategy for hedging its exposure to changes in the price of gas in line with retail gas sales contracts.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In April 2022, HBL had initiated ICC arbitration proceedings against Jones Celtic Bioenergy Limited (“JCBL”), a renewable energy engineering company, in respect of claims arising out of HBL’s termination of JCBL’s employment under an EPC contract for the design and building of a bioenergy plant at Huntstown. Pursuant to these proceedings, HBL claimed approximately €30 million from JCBL, and JCBL in turn, has made a counter claim of approximately €22 million. At the time of commencement of the arbitration proceedings, HBL was an unrestricted subsidiary under the Existing Notes Indenture. Subsequently, in February 2023, we sold our shareholding in HBL.

In this capacity, the Minister is advised by the DECC and other statutory bodies including the CRU and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The CRU (formerly the Commission for Electricity Regulation) was established as the regulator of the electricity sector by the 1999 Act, was subsequently vested with regulatory authority over the downstream natural gas sector by the 2002 Act, and by the Water Services Act 2013 became Irish Water’s economic regulator and by the European Union (Renewable Energy) Regulations (2) 2022 were appointed as regulator of district heating and cooling networks. _Regulators’ objectives and duties_ The principal objective of the CRU in carrying out its functions in relation to energy (other than in respect of SEM matters) is to protect the interests of energy consumers, wherever appropriate, by promoting effective competition between persons engaged in, or in commercial activities connected with, the generation, transmission or supply of electricity and the transportation and supply of natural gas. The CRU has a duty to carry out its functions in a manner that does not discriminate between market participants. The functions of the CRU include advising the Minister, licensing market participants, the general supervision and enforcement of the licensing regime, the regulation of third-party access and network tariffs in both the electricity and natural gas sectors, the setting of electricity and natural gas market rules, setting residential natural gas tariffs and regulating safety in electricity and natural gas supply. _Licenses_ There are thirteen types of electricity license: transmission system operation, transmission system ownership, distribution system operation, distribution asset ownership, interconnector transport and maintenance, SEM operation, supply, public electricity supply, generation demand response, aggregation, energy storage, not own use purchasing, and eight types of downstream natural gas license: ownership and operation of the transmission system, ownership and operation of the distribution system, supply, shipping and operation of LNG facilities and operation of storage. Licenses regulate the economic behavior of licensee, set a framework for competition in generation and supply, underpin the arrangements relating to security of supply, and protect the technical integrity of the system. Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 plants and the subsidiaries of Energia Renewables that own operational wind farms hold electricity generation licenses. Customer Solutions holds electricity and natural gas supply licenses and a natural gas shipping license. Energia Generation’s generation licenses require Huntstown 1 and Huntstown 2 plants to, amongst other things: - comply with specified industry codes; - submit to central dispatch by the TSO in the RoI in providing energy and ancillary services to the electricity system; - appoint a competent operator; - comply with the rules governing the submission of commercial offers to the SEMO; and - provide the CRU with information and comply with regulatory requests. The generation licenses held by the subsidiaries of Energia Renewables that own operational wind farms are similar to the two Huntstown plants’ generation licenses. Customer Solutions’ electricity supply license requires it to, amongst other things: - comply with specified industry codes; ----- - comply with the relevant license conditions of energy generators (where acting as an intermediary for generators such as wind farms) in submitting commercial offers; and - provide CRU with information and comply with regulatory requests. Customer Solutions’ natural gas supply and shipping licenses requires it to, amongst other things: - comply with specified industry codes (the principal rules for shipping natural gas in the RoI are contained in the Gas Networks Ireland Code of Operations); and - provide CRU with information and comply with regulatory requests.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The 1992 Order has been amended by subsequent legislation, including the 2003 Order and, to facilitate the creation of the SEM, the Electricity Regulations (NI) 2007 and the SEM Order (as amended by the Electricity (Single Wholesale Market) Order (Amendment) Regulations (NI) 2016. More recently, the 1992 Order has been amended by The Gas and Electricity (Internal Markets) Regulations (NI) 2011, The Gas and Electricity (Internal Markets) Regulations (NI) 2013, The Gas and Electricity Licence Modification and Appeals Regulations (NI) 2015 and the Electricity and Gas (Ownership Unbundling) Regulations (NI) 2015 to comply with the requirements of the European Commission’s energy “Third Package” suite of legislative measures comprising Directive 2009/72/EC, Directive 2009/73/EC, Regulation (EC) No. 713/2009, Regulation (EC) No. 714/2009 and Regulation (EC) No. 715/2009. The gas industry in NI is governed principally by the Gas (NI) Order 1996 (the “1996 Order”) and its regulations, the conditions of the licenses which have been granted under the 1996 Order, the 2003 Order and the Energy Act (NI) 2011. The 1996 Order has been amended by subsequent legislation, including The Gas and Electricity (Internal Markets) Regulations (NI) 2011, The Gas and Electricity (Internal Markets) Regulations (NI) 2013, The Gas and Electricity Licence Modification and Appeals Regulations (NI) 2015 and the Electricity and Gas (Ownership Unbundling) Regulations (NI) 2015 to comply with the requirements of the European Commission’s energy “Third Package” suite of legislative measures comprising Directive 2009/72/EC, Directive 2009/73/EC, Regulation (EC) No. 713/2009, Regulation (EC) No. 714/2009 and Regulation (EC) No. 715/2009. _Government departments and other regulators_ The DfE is responsible for overall energy policy in NI. Its functions include providing regulatory consent for new generating stations and overhead lines, ensuring fuel security, encouraging renewable generation and supervising other matters relating to the quality and safety of electricity supply. The UR is responsible for regulating NI’s electricity, natural gas and water industries. The specific powers, duties and functions of the UR are derived from legislation. The functions of the UR include licensing and the general supervision and enforcement of the NI licensing regime. _Regulators’ objectives and duties_ The UR is charged with protecting the interests of consumers in the NI electricity market and promoting effective competition between enterprises engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution or supply of electricity, including the need to ensure that all reasonable customer demands are met and that electricity license holders are able to finance their authorized generation activities. In relation to the NI natural gas market, the UR’s principal objective is to promote the development and maintenance of an economically efficient natural gas industry in NI. The UR also has statutory responsibility to consider the effect of the industry’s activities on the environment and its role includes promoting energy efficiency. The 2003 Order gives the NI Consumer Council responsibility for representing electricity consumers and addressing any complaints. The NI Consumer Council has the power to investigate matters relating to the interests of consumers regarding their electricity supply and to obtain information from electricity license holders. _Licenses_ There are five types of electricity license available in NI, pertaining to participation in electricity transmission, distribution, supply, generation, and SEM operation, and four types of natural gas licenses, ----- pertaining to participation in natural gas, conveyance, supply, storage and operation of a liquefaction of natural gas facility. The NI licensing regime is intended to establish a framework for competition in generation and supply, ensure the security of the natural gas and electricity supply, protect the technical integrity of the system and provide for certain types of customer services. Power NI Energy holds an electricity supply license that covers the activities of both Power NI and PPB. In addition, PPB holds a natural gas supply license that is restricted to supply to Ballylumford power station and Power NI Energy holds a natural gas supply license although it is yet to become an active gas supplier in NI. Power NI Energy’s electricity supply license requires Power NI to: - purchase wholesale supplies in an economically efficient manner (the economic purchasing obligation); - act as supplier of last resort if directed to do so by the UR, for example if another supplier were to fail; - comply with specified industry codes and agreements; - set its prices, with regard to the tariff methodology statement, which sets out the policy for calculating and setting its prices, as approved by the UR; - comply with codes of practice on payment of bills, services for vulnerable customers, the efficient use of electricity and complaint handling and services for customers with prepayment meters; - maintain managerial and operational independence; and - comply with various conditions governing supply to residential customers in the competitive market, including a prohibition of discrimination in supply where the licensee (together with its affiliates) is in a dominant position. License conditions applicable to PPB require it to: - contract for electricity at the best effective price reasonably obtainable, having regard for the sources available, and keep its commitments under review (PPB’s economic purchasing obligation); - enter into and comply with arrangements that facilitate PPB bidding into the SEM the capacity contracted to it under long-term generating contracts; - comply with the regulatory rules for trading in the SEM and the rules governing the submission of commercial offers to the SEMO; and - comply with the separate interface arrangements that govern PPB’s relationships with SONI and NIE. Power NI Energy’s license requires it to establish, and at all times maintain, full managerial and operational independence between PPB and the other businesses within the Group. PPB’s compliance plan sets out the practices, procedures, systems and rules of conduct to ensure compliance with this license condition. _License compliance, modification, termination and revocation_ The UR has statutory powers to enforce compliance with license conditions. The 2003 Order provides for the UR to levy a financial penalty (up to 10% of the licensee’s revenue) for breach of a relevant condition. The UR may modify the conditions of licenses, either in accordance with the terms of the licenses or the procedures set out in the relevant legislation. Modifications may introduce new conditions (relating to activities authorized by the license or to other activities) or may amend existing conditions. In addition, specific powers have been given to the UR in legislation to modify license conditions without the licensee’s consent (e.g., to implement EU legislation). Following the introduction of the Gas and Electricity Licence Modifications and Appeals Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015, the UR modified existing electricity and gas licenses, with effect from August 6, 2015, ----- to provide that the UR can make license modifications without consent but subject to an appeals mechanism by affected licensees. Licenses may be terminated by not less than 25 years’ notice given by the DfE or the UR (depending on the terms of the relevant license) and are revocable (on 30 days or 24 hours’ notice, depending on the event) in certain circumstances including where the licensee consents to revocation, where the licensee fails to comply with an enforcement order made by the UR, or where specified insolvency procedures are initiated in respect of the licensee or its assets. _Environmental regulation_ The Group faces a number of environmental responsibilities in the normal course of business. To the best of the Group’s knowledge, the Group is materially in compliance with all relevant environmental laws and regulations. The Group undertakes environmental risk assessments ahead of major capital projects and carries out environmental studies and environmental risk mitigation programs to minimize any impact on the environment. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The Issuer will be dependent upon payments from other members of the Group to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to _our structure—The Issuer is a finance subsidiary that has no revenue generating operations of its own and depends on cash received under its intercompany loan in order to be able to make payments on the Notes.” All of_ the operations of the Company will be conducted through the Company’s Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Company will depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Note Guarantees. Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In particular, Power NI Energy Limited, is not permitted to guarantee the Notes for regulatory reasons and Derrysallagh Supply Limited will not guarantee the Notes as it effectively ceased trading on October 1, 2022, following the transfer of its long-term power purchase agreement to Energia Customer Solutions Limited. Additionally, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries, which include, among others, Energia Group Fundco I Limited, Energia Group Fundco II Limited, Energia Group Fundco III Limited, Energia Renewables Development Limited and Energia Customer Solutions NI Limited, will not guarantee the Notes. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders of Notes to participate in those assets) will be structurally subordinated to that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s Indebtedness and other obligations (including trade payables, preference shares and lease obligations, if any), except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be effectively subordinated to any obligations secured over the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and subordinated in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary that is senior to the claims held by the Issuer or such Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our structure—The Notes will be structurally subordinated _to the liabilities of non-Guarantor members of the Group.”_ For the year ended March 31, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors generated 32.4% of the Group’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (excluding all intragroup items except the allocations of intercompany costs from the Huntstown plants and the intercompany PPA revenue from the Unrestricted Subsidiaries) and as at March 31, 2023, held 54.0% of the Group’s consolidated total assets (excluding Consolidation Adjustments). For the year ended March 31, 2023, excluding Unrestricted Subsidiaries, the Guarantors generated 48.7% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (excluding all intragroup items except the allocations of intercompany costs from the Huntstown plants and the intercompany PPA revenue from the Unrestricted Subsidiaries), and as at March 31, 2023, held 73.0% of its consolidated total assets (excluding Consolidation Adjustments). For the year ended March 31, 2023, excluding Unrestricted Subsidiaries, Power NI (which is not permitted to guarantee the Notes for regulatory reasons) and Derrysallagh Supply Limited which will not guaranteed the Notes as it effectively ceased trading on October 1, 2022, following the transfer of its long-term power purchase agreement to Energia Customer Solutions Limited), the Guarantors generated 126.7% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (excluding all intragroup items except the allocations of intercompany costs from the Huntstown plants and the intercompany PPA revenue from the Unrestricted Subsidiaries), and as at March 31, 2023, held 94.0% of its consolidated total assets (excluding Consolidation Adjustments).

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.20,Change of Control,21.20.1,,"If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change _of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all (equal to €100,000 aggregate_ principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any Notes as described under this heading “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that they have unconditionally exercised their right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived. The definition of “Change of Control” provides that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred if such Change of Control is also a Specified Change of Control Event. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to the Paying Agent (with a copy to the Trustee) who will send such notice to each Holder of any Notes: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; ----- (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased (including that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a facsimile or electronic transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Notes purchased); and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes of a series have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in relation to Notes. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer for such Notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third- party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that ----- remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes, Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the U.S. Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a change of control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources, including the financial resources of the Restricted Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our structure—We may not be able to obtain the funds _required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of such Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as specified under the definition of “Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Applicable Test Date; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other_ than euros, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euros, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer, nor the Guarantors nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

(a) Subject to the discussion below, the Issuer will not be obliged to make a withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax from a payment of interest on a Note so long as the following conditions are met: the Notes are quoted Eurobonds, i.e. securities which are issued by a company (such as the Issuer), which are quoted on a recognized stock exchange (which is interpreted by the Irish Revenue Commissioners to mean an exchange which is recognized by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the country in which it is located and has substantially the same level of recognition in that country as the Irish Stock Exchange has in RoI, such as the Exchange) and which carry a right to interest; and (b) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in RoI, or if such person is in RoI, either: (i) the Note is held in a clearing system recognized by the Irish Revenue Commissioners; (Euroclear and Clearstream are, amongst others, so recognized); or (ii) the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in RoI and has made a declaration to a relevant person (such as a paying agent located in RoI) in the prescribed form. Thus, subject to the discussion below, so long as the Notes continue to be quoted on a recognized stock exchange (such as the Exchange) and are held in a clearing system recognized by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, interest on the Notes can be paid by any paying agent acting on behalf of the Issuer free of any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax. If the Notes continue to be quoted but cease to be held in a recognized clearing system, interest on the Notes may be paid without any withholding or deduction for or on account of Irish income tax provided such payment is made through a paying agent outside RoI. Interest or other distributions paid out on the Notes which are profit-dependent or any part of which exceeds a reasonable commercial return could, under certain anti-avoidance provisions, be recharacterized as a non-deductible distribution and so be subject to dividend withholding tax in certain circumstances.

This summary deals only with Notes held as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) by U.S. holders (as defined below) who purchase the Notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler). As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including, without limitation: - a dealer in securities or currencies; - a financial institution; - a regulated investment company; - a real estate investment trust; - a tax-exempt organization; - an insurance company; - a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle; - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities; - a person liable for alternative minimum tax; - a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity); ----- - a person whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or - a United States expatriate.

Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. The Group has not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those discussed below.

Interest income on a Note will generally be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, will generally be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. In addition, Treasury regulations (the “Foreign Tax Credit Regulations”) impose additional requirements for foreign taxes to be eligible for a foreign tax credit, and there can be no assurance that those requirements will be satisfied. Instead of claiming a foreign tax credit, you may be able to deduct foreign withholding taxes on interest in computing your taxable income, subject to generally applicable limitations under United States law (including that a U.S. holder is not eligible for a deduction for foreign income taxes paid or accrued in a taxable year if such U.S. holder claims a foreign tax credit for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued in the same taxable year). The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the Foreign Tax Credit Regulations and the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. Interest on the Notes will be payable in foreign currencies. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the amount of foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the foreign currency so received). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest on the Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued. Under the second method, you may translate interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if you use the ----- accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you will recognize ordinary gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the amount of foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

If the Notes are issued with OID, you generally must include the OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) in advance of the receipt of the cash payment thereof and regardless of your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID, if any, that you must include in income for any taxable year with respect to a Note will generally equal the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during such taxable year on which you held that Note (“accrued OID”). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal and interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of - the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the accrual period multiplied by its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period, over - the aggregate of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID, if any, for each prior accrual period. Under these rules, you generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. OID on a Note will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars, in the same manner as interest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis, as described above. You will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued interest). For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed: - first, as the receipt of any qualified stated interest payments called for under the terms of the Note; - second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and - third, as the receipt of principal.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be your cost for that Note, increased by any ----- OID previously included in income. If you purchased a Note with foreign currency, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount of foreign currency paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the purchase, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for any foreign currency (as may be applicable), then your amount realized generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement or disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in foreign currency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

The New EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the New EU Insolvency Regulation that includes, among others, the insolvency proceeding, court-approved refinancing agreements, out-of-court payment proceedings and anticipated arrangement proposals. The determination of where a debtor has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. In accordance with Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, the COMI of a company is presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption only applies if such company’s registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. However, it is possible to rebut this presumption “where the company’s central administration is located _in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State”_ (preamble 30 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation). Prior to June 26, 2017, when the New EU Insolvency Regulation came into effect, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a company’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where such company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and it may change from time to time, but it is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency proceedings unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within the 3month period prior to the filing of the insolvency proceedings. ----- The New EU Insolvency Regulation distinguishes between: - main insolvency proceedings, which have universal scope and are aimed at encompassing all the debtor’s assets, and - secondary insolvency proceedings, which run in parallel with the main insolvency proceedings and are limited to the assets located in a different Member State to that in which the debtor has its COMI. Main insolvency proceedings in respect of a debtor may be commenced in the jurisdiction of the Member State (other than Denmark) where such debtor has its COMI and, therefore, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence any of the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, including those mentioned above. Those main insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the New EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark). Secondary (or ‘territorial’) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State against the same debtor, but only if such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation to mean any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Depending on whether the main insolvency proceedings commence prior to or after the commencement of secondary insolvency proceedings, the following scenarios should be noted: - where main insolvency proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which a debtor has its COMI, any insolvency proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State shall be secondary insolvency proceedings; and - where main insolvency proceedings in the Member State in which a debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be opened in such other Member State where such debtor has an establishment in the event that either (a) main insolvency proceedings cannot be opened because of the conditions laid down by the law of the Member State within the territory of which the debtor’s COMI is situated; or (b) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (x) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested; or (y) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, any territorial insolvency proceedings which were commenced prior to that date shall become secondary insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, the courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the main insolvency proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings (because the relevant debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of such debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations (such as the preservation of (a) third parties’ _right in rem, pursuant to Article 8 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation and (b) sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title, pursuant to Article 10 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation) so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the relevant debtor has assets. In order to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may also give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary proceedings could be opened that, when distributing assets or realization proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary proceedings were opened in that Member State. This, however, is subject to a “qualified majority” (as defined under national law) of known local creditors (being creditors whose claims against a debtor arose from or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated in a Member State other than the Member State in ----- which the debtor’s COMI is located) approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution of proceeds and ranking of claims is also the law of the state where secondary insolvency proceedings are opened. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus (i.e. the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Following the entry into force of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a debtor’s COMI has shifted in the preceding 3 months, the rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Moreover, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (which will no longer be limited only to “winding-up proceedings”) will be possible not only if the relevant debtor has an establishment in such Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if such debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings. Please note that jurisdictions outside the European Union may not require a COMI shift in order for an RoI incorporated and registered company to initiate insolvency proceedings in those jurisdictions (similar to the UK with respect to schemes of arrangements). However, recognition of any such foreign insolvency proceedings may not be possible in RoI. In addition, any creditor could institute main insolvency proceeding with respect to the RoI company in the RoI. _Insolvency proceedings of members of a group of companies_ As the Issuer and the Guarantors are members of a group of companies, it is noteworthy that Chapter V of the New EU Insolvency Regulation (Articles 56 et seq.) has introduced a process by which a group of companies experiencing difficulties may commence group coordination proceedings featuring the appointment of a single insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of that group’s members. Under Article 61 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in the insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. In any event, participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations of a Reorganization Plan (defined below) is voluntary. _Third-parties’ rights in rem_ The New EU Insolvency Regulation also provides for some important rules regarding the rights of secured creditors, in particular under Article 8, according to which the opening of insolvency proceedings shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third-parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time, belonging to the debtor which are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. In particular, these rights in rem shall mean: (a) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; (b) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; (c) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and (d) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The right, recorded in a public register and enforceable against third-parties, based on which a right in _rem within the meaning of Article 8 (1) may be obtained, shall be considered to be a right in rem._ These provisions under Article 8(1) shall not preclude actions for voidness, voidability or unenforceability as referred to in point (m) of Article 7(2) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation. ----- _Brexit_ As set out in greater detail below, the UK is no longer a member of the EU and ceased to be treated as such at 11:00 p.m. (London time) on December 31, 2020 (see “—United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU”). Amongst other implications is that, generally speaking, the provisions of the New EU Insolvency Regulation (including, in particular, those providing for automatic, mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings) no longer apply as between the UK and Member States. Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast)), and the 2007 Lugano Convention (on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters), which had previously been considered as potential bases on which UK schemes of arrangement might be recognized in Member States, also generally ceased to apply to the UK. As a result, the issue of whether UK insolvency and restructuring proceedings would be recognized in Member States, and vice versa, has become materially more uncertain and complex. In the UK, there remains a framework for the recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in, and/or judgments of the courts of, a Member State, including under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (subject to the satisfaction of the relevant threshold requirements). Recognition in any Member State of UK insolvency or restructuring proceedings will be a question of the domestic laws of that country, including applicable EU law. Certain Member States have adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which may allow for the recognition of UK insolvency proceedings on a similar basis to UK recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. Depending on the relevant circumstances, UK restructuring proceedings may still be recognized in a Member State under the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements, EC Regulation 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I), and/or under private international law rules applicable in that country. In summary, however, recognition of insolvency and restructuring proceedings as between the UK and Member States is no longer automatic and there is increased risk that recognition will not be forthcoming in all relevant jurisdictions. This may necessitate parallel proceedings in multiple jurisdictions, which could result in increased costs, delay and potential inconsistency in approach or outcome.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Each system requires the appointment of a liquidator, who assumes control of the company and whose function it is to collect, realize and distribute the assets of the company to its creditors in accordance with the statutory order of priority and thereafter (in the case of a solvent company) to distribute any surplus among the company’s shareholders. Generally speaking as a matter of Cayman Islands law, contracts to which a Cayman Islands company is party are not automatically terminated and nor is the counterparty released from its obligations, by the company’s entry into liquidation. The question of whether, as a contractual matter, the commencement of a liquidation has any effect on the parties’ contractual obligations will fall to be determined according to the governing law of each contract to which the company is a party. The liquidator of a Cayman Islands company has no statutory right to disclaim onerous contracts. A petition to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands (the “Court”) for a winding-up order may be presented by the company itself or by a creditor or shareholder of the company. One of the grounds upon which a winding-up order may be sought is that the company is unable to pay its debts as defined in Section 93 of the Cayman Islands Companies Act (As Revised) (the “Cayman **Companies Act”). The test for insolvency in the Cayman Islands is a cash flow test which includes an element of futurity (although how into the future the Court will look is highly fact specific). ----- When a winding-up order is made by the Court or a voluntary winding-up is continued under the supervision of the Court (i.e., in an official liquidation), an automatic moratorium on litigation against the company is imposed pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Cayman Companies Act—that is, proceedings may not be commenced or continued against the company without the permission of the Court. Pursuant to Section 99 of the Cayman Companies Act, dispositions of property, transfers of shares and alterations in the status of shareholders after the date of presentation of the winding-up petition are void, unless the Court orders otherwise. The moratorium does not prevent a secured creditor from realizing its security as set out below, nor does it affect any valid contractual subordination rights, or rights of set off or netting of claims which were granted before the commencement of the official liquidation. It is a fundamental rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors are treated equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred to as the _pari passu rule. This rule applies to the claims of ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors existing as at the date of the commencement of the winding up of the company, or whose claims arise out of causes of action that accrued before the commencement of the winding up. Subject to certain exceptions, when a winding up order is made, the winding up is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of a winding-up petition. Generally speaking, a creditor having a validly created security interest over property of a company in liquidation is entitled to enforce their security in accordance with its terms without reference to the official liquidators and without the leave of the Court pursuant to section 142(1) of the Cayman Companies Act. The official liquidator may also, with the agreement of the secured creditor, realize the secured asset for the benefit of the secured creditor, and deduct their remuneration in connection with the sale from the sale proceeds (in accordance with section 142(2) of the Cayman Companies Act). The claims of preferred creditors under Cayman Islands law will rank ahead of unsecured creditors and secured creditors holding security in the nature of a floating charge. All costs, charges and expenses properly incurred in the winding up of the company, including the remuneration of the liquidators, are payable out of the assets of the company in priority to unsecured claims. An official liquidator must be a qualified insolvency practitioner who meets independence, insurance and residence requirements (and as such a foreign receiver or liquidator may not act as the sole liquidator of a Cayman Islands company). A liquidator is an officer of the Court and has fiduciary duties to the company to act in good faith, for a proper purpose and for the benefit of the company at all times. A voluntary liquidation is most commonly instituted by way of special resolution of the voting shareholders of the company. There is no automatic moratorium on litigation against the company in a voluntary liquidation and no equivalent to Section 99 of the Cayman Companies Act; although Section 125 of the Cayman Companies Act provides that a transfer of shares or alteration in the status of shareholders made after the commencement of the voluntary liquidation is void unless sanctioned by the liquidator. As with an official liquidation, a voluntary liquidation does not prevent a secured creditor from enforcing their security in accordance with its terms. There are no restrictions on who may act as the voluntary liquidator of a Cayman Islands company. If, within 28 days of the commencement of the voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company do not provide a declaration of solvency to the liquidator (which is then filed with the Registrar of Companies), the voluntary liquidator is obliged by law to apply to the Court for a supervision order. The practical effect of this is that, upon a supervision order being made, the voluntary liquidation proceeds as if it were an official liquidation in all respects. This could lead to substantially increased costs of the liquidation since, among other things, the liquidator will be obliged to provide the Court and the stakeholders with regular reports detailing the assets and liabilities of the company and all of the steps taken in the liquidation to date. A declaration of solvency takes into account the ability of the company to pay its debts within a period of twelve months of the declaration being made. Even if the directors do provide such a declaration, a voluntary liquidator may still apply to the Court for supervision in circumstances where he thinks that such an order will facilitate a more effective, economic or expeditious liquidation of the company in the interests of its stakeholders.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

A company’s board is given statutory power to file such a petition without shareholder pre-approval or a specific power to do so in the company’s articles of association. Upon filing of a petition for the appointment of a Restructuring Officer, and pending the hearing of that petition, the Companies Act creates an automatic stay on ----- all creditor action and shareholder power to resolve to wind up the company. That stay applies extra-territorially. If a Restructuring Officer is appointed by the court, the compromise or arrangement with creditors is promoted within those proceedings. In the event that creditors reject the proposal and the company remains insolvent, a creditor or creditors may seek the winding up of the company, if the company does not move to appoint liquidators itself.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In addition, as referred to above, under Section 99 of the Cayman Companies Act, any disposition of the company’s property made after the commencement of an official liquidation is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. _Fraudulent dispositions_ Under section 146 of the Cayman Companies Act, if a company goes into liquidation and it has disposed of its property at an undervalue with the intent to defraud its creditors, the Court may, on the application of the liquidator, set the disposition aside. A disposition will constitute a disposition at an undervalue if the disposition is on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a disposition for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the property which is the subject of the disposition. The liquidator must show that there was “intent to defraud” a creditor, meaning an intention to wilfully defeat an obligation owed to a creditor. Unlike with voidable preferences as outlined below, there is no requirement to show insolvency at the time of the disposition (however, it is unlikely that any creditors will be prejudiced by any such disposition unless the company is insolvent). Under section 4 of the Fraudulent Dispositions Act (As Revised) (“Fraudulent Dispositions Act”), a disposition of property made with an intent to defraud (again defined as an intention of a transferor wilfully to defeat an obligation owed to a creditor) and at an undervalue is voidable at the instance of a creditor thereby prejudiced. Under both the Cayman Companies Act and the Fraudulent Dispositions Act, an application to set aside a disposition must be made within six years of the date of the disposition. _Preferences_ If, within six months before the commencement of the winding up of a company, at a time when it cannot pay its debts, the company makes a payment, or transfers or charges any of its property, or takes or suffers any judicial proceedings, in favor of any of its creditors with a view to giving that creditor a preference over the other creditors of the company, the transaction will be void. This is the effect of section 145 of the Cayman Companies Act. The essence of a voidable preference is that the company, knowing that it cannot pay all its debts in full, voluntarily and improperly makes a payment or gives a benefit to one creditor which results in an inequality between the creditor and the company’s other creditors. A transaction will only be set aside as a voidable preference if the company’s act was undertaken voluntarily, with a dominant intention to prefer the creditor (Cayman Islands law imposes a subjective test) and the company was insolvent at the time the payment was made. Additionally, in this context, a payment made to a related party of the company will be deemed to have been made with a view to giving that creditor a preference. _Orders_ In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required, the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into. ----- _Common law remedies_ Depending on the circumstances, in addition to the above statutory provisions the Court may effectively reverse certain antecedent transactions based on common law and/or equitable principles. For example, in the event a transaction amounts to a breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties, and if a person knowingly receives the company’s property as a result of that breach in circumstances where it would be unconscionable for them to retain the property, the Court may order that this property is being held on constructive trust for the company. The application of these principles can be complex and highly fact-sensitive. There is no statutory provision dealing directly with insolvent trading in the Cayman Islands. Directors may be liable for breach of their fiduciary obligations, however, if the company continues to incur liabilities to the prejudice of the company’s creditors at a time when there is no reasonable prospect of the company trading out of its financial difficulties.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

If there are creditors who form a class, the class will be bound by the scheme if a majority in number representing 75% in value of the class who attended (whether in person or by proxy) and voted, approved the scheme. Cayman Islands case law suggests that a class is constituted by “those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their acting in their common interest.” Two or more creditors are likely to constitute separate classes in a compromise or arrangement if they hold security over different assets or hold security over the same asset but do not rank equally.

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the secured party in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the secured party, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets would be applied as per the order of priority set out above.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to the New EU Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the UK is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted by domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under that EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA. On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a Member State, including for the purpose of the New EU Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as a Member State. The New EU Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and paragraph 1, schedule 5, European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) (the “Insolvency Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings under the New EU Insolvency Regulation, providing for the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, no longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the New EU Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the New EU Insolvency Regulation will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings. The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, the post-IP Day New EU Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK in respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and: - the debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the UK; or - the debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK. These tests are consistent with the New EU Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the UK court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there to be a sufficient connection with England and Wales (and that (a) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (b) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its COMI is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the UK; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its COMI in a Member State, into administration. While the English courts can assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings on these bases, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border _recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings”)._ -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The courts of England and Wales would have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings, based on English insolvency laws, over an English company. In addition, the UK Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) in Great Britain and which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in the world without any condition of reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings in respect of an English company may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main proceedings where it has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non main proceedings where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court). Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways. These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to court for an administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or, in the case of liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on the Issue Date and the Notes will be secured by security interests over the Collateral on or about the Issue Date. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Note Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Note Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), in each case under Section ----- 123 of the Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable or if the following would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency”). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined herein) granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s) to receive the proceeds of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior ranking claims in the statutory order of priority, (see “—Priority on insolvency” ). An administrator may also, with the prior approval of the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (see further below). If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security granted by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the administrator would depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. Accordingly, if any of the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration, the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29 of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court grants an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended)), as set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Priority on insolvency”).",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question, together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realized on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among others, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported ----- fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors would be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the court’s sanction order to the Registrar of Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration. A scheme of arrangement can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third-parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent. ----- In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. A simple majority of the company’s members must also have voted in favor of the proposal. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. As noted above, the company’s shareholders will also vote on the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the decision of the creditors differs from the decision of the shareholders, the former will prevail unless a shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders that the decision of the shareholders should prevail.

In the case of compulsory liquidation, even if a foreign company has neither its COMI or an establishment in the UK, it may be wound up as an unregistered company if the court considers there to be (i) a sufficient connection with England and Wales, (ii) a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (iii) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise a jurisdiction. Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The key difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as defined herein) and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once the winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a windingup order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or ----- may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. As an exception to the principle of _pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency setoff applies). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only; - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid; - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay ----- due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include: (a) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that such claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors; - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge; - Seventh ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This, however, does not include “currency conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. See “—Administration, administrative receivership and floating charges” above for a description of the Prescribed Part.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606
451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1259,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND SECURITY,1259.4,England and Wales,1259.4.15,Avoidance of transactions,"There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security or guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company enters administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) after the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it. ----- _Onset of insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is made, (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date on which the windingup petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director or shadow director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security interests: _Transaction at an undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings. In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. ----- If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any security interests granted or guarantees, although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order by the court may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) except where that person was a party to the transaction or the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or guarantee was granted within the period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees), subject to the same principles as are described above with respect to transactions at an undervalue). However, the court will only make such an order if it is shown that, in deciding to give the preference, the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and that it was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence (it is not open to the connected person to rebut the presumption of insolvency). _Transaction defrauding creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined above) and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant company voluntary arrangement or, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction, or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under ----- the Notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). _Grant of floating charge_ Under English insolvency law, if (i) a floating charge is granted by an English company within the period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency and (ii) at the time of granting the floating charge or as a consequence thereof, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating charge will be invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for the English obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in part or in full) the relevant floating charge; any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating charge will not be invalidated on this basis. As referred to above (see “—Fixed and floating charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterised as a floating charge. If purported fixed charge security that is subsequently recharacterised has been granted within the relevant suspect period referred to above, this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the consideration provided.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following: (a) _Moratorium The 2020 Insolvency Act introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. ----- During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The 2020 Insolvency Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration, _administrative receivership and floating charges,” “—Avoidance of transactions—Grant of floating charge” and_ “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). (b) _Ipso Facto clauses prohibited The 2020 Insolvency Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding ----- that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this new prohibition. (c) _Restructuring plan The 2020 Insolvency Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company). Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent. Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario. ----- A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette). On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “Act”) enacted fundamental reforms to the UK’s existing insolvency and companies legislation, amending several provisions of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following: _(a)_ _Moratorium_ The Act introduced a new standalone moratorium under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part 1A moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for ----- a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). Part 1A includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration, administrative _receivership and floating charges,” “—Avoidance of transactions—Grant of floating charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security_ charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). ----- _(b)_ _Ipso Facto clauses prohibited_ The Act introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this new prohibition. _(c)_ _Restructuring plan_ The Act also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company). Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989), recent case law in England and Wales indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether more the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent. ----- Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario. A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette).",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk in respect of the non-sterling amount proved between the date on which such English obligor goes into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled.

Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with an English company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the Supreme Court has recently held that it takes place when the company in question is insolvent or bordering on insolvency, or when an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable. Security and/or guarantees granted by an English obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the Model Law, which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign ----- insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are not regarded as insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties (the one case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter position). _Recognition in the EU_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the transition period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in Member States. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more Member States will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in Member States. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other Member States. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in Member States. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a Member State. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to the New EU Insolvency Regulation as it applies to the UK is to be read, on or after Exit Day, as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended, modified or re-enacted by domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under that EU regulation, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA. On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a Member State, including for the purpose of the New EU Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as a Member State. ----- The New EU Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019) and paragraph 1, Schedule 5 European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (the “Insolvency Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding mutual recognition of insolvency proceedings under the New EU Insolvency Regulation, providing for the automatic recognition of insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, no longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the New EU Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the New EU Insolvency Regulation will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings. The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the UK. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under Northern Irish law, the post-IP Day New EU Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the UK in respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and: - the debtor’s center of main interests is in the UK; or - the debtor’s center of main interests is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK. These tests are consistent with the New EU Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the UK court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there to be a sufficient connection with Northern Ireland (and that (a) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (b) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its COMI is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the UK; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its COMI in a Member State, into administration.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to a Northern Irish company should be commenced in NI based on Northern Irish insolvency laws; although insolvency proceedings in respect of Northern Irish companies could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of NI may be initiated in a number of ways, including by (i) the company, its directors, or one or more of its creditors making an application to the High Court of Northern Ireland for an administration order, (ii) the company, its directors, or a qualifying floating chargeholder appointing administrators out of court, or (iii) a creditor or the directors or members of the company filing a petition to wind-up a Northern Irish company or the company resolving to wind itself up (in the case of liquidation). A Northern Irish company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. Under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended), a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order).",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable or if the following would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or ----- preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “— _Priority on insolvency”)._ Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined herein) granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s) to receive the proceeds of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior ranking claims in the statutory order of priority, (see “—Priority on insolvency” ). An administrator may also, with the prior approval of the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (see further below). If a Northern Irish company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security granted by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the administrator would depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, or the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration, the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In England and Wales the statutory moratorium does not apply to security interests created or arising under a “financial collateral agreement” (generally, security/collateral in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the “2003 Regulations”). The 2003 Regulations were implemented at a time when the Enterprise Act 2002 was in force in England and Wales; however the equivalent provisions in NI were not introduced until the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 (the “2005 Order”) came into force. The 2005 Order introduced Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and replaced Part III of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 which the 2003 Regulations had amended as far as financial collateral arrangements were concerned. Following this, the Financial Markets and Insolvency (Settlement Finality and Financial Collateral Arrangements) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (the “2010 Regulations”) reflected the changes brought about to the administration regime in NI, as a consequence of the implementation of the 2005 Order. However, there appears to be one omission, which is the failure of the 2010 Regulations to disable the ----- effect of Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, in relation to a receiver appointed pursuant to a financial collateral arrangement. Therefore, if a Northern Irish company were to enter administration, it is possible that the security or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of court or consent of the administrator. In addition, as stated above, Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) has not been disapplied by the 2003 Regulations or the 2010 Regulations. Accordingly, there is a risk that any receiver appointed over an asset of a Northern Irish company under a financial collateral arrangement prior to administration may be required to vacate office by an administrator of that entity if an administrator was appointed pursuant to the laws of NI. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent would obtain this leave of court or consent of the administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed receiver must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed over that company’s fixed assets (commonly referred to as a Fixed Charge Receiver) without the leave of the Court or the administrator’s consent.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings in respect of the Northern Irish Guarantors are likely to be",1259.8.3,"Administration, administrative receivership and floating charges","As set out above, the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 empowers the High Court of Northern Ireland to make an administration order in respect of a Northern Irish company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant Northern Irish obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of Northern Irish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre dates 27 March 2006, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended by the 2005 Order) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended), which will apply if a Northern Irish obligor creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that paragraph 15 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Article 5(1) of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended). The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant Northern Irish obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. An administrator, receiver or liquidator of the company will be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses (floating charge realizations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies ----- to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2022) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before November 4, 2022, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court grants an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office. As stated above, the 2010 Regulations did not disable the effect of Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, in relation to a receiver appointed pursuant to a financial collateral arrangement. Therefore, if a Northern Irish company were to enter administration, it is possible that the security or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of court or consent of the administrator. Further, as stated above, Paragraph 42(2) of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) has not been disapplied by the 2003 Regulations or the 2010 Regulations. Accordingly, there is a risk that any receiver appointed over an asset of a Northern Irish company under a financial collateral arrangement prior to administration may be required to vacate office by an administrator of that entity if an administrator was appointed pursuant to the laws of NI. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective insolvency procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings in respect of the Northern Irish Guarantors are likely to be",1259.8.5,Fixed versus floating charges,"There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and, where the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which include the administrator’s remuneration and can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets (provided the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and the fixed charge holder has no notice of any restrictions); (c) provided that the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security may be subject to certain challenges under Northern Irish insolvency law (see “—Avoidance of transactions— _Grant of floating charge”); and (f) where the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a_ security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge security is (i) subject to the expenses of the insolvent estate, (ii) subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee, salary claims (up to a cap per ----- employee), employee holiday claims, certain unpaid pension contributions, and VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC) and (iii) as noted above, subject to the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) for unsecured creditors; (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court approval but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question, together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realized on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under Northern Irish law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be created by an Northern Irish law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among others, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

A Northern Irish obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to Northern Ireland could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in Northern Ireland, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) a Northern Irish governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly incorporated Northern Irish company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors would be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the court’s sanction order to the Registrar of Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration. A scheme of arrangement can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third-parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. ----- Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (see below) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who vote (either in person or by proxy) at a meeting of creditors in favor of the arrangement, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. A simple majority of the Company’s members must also have voted in favor of the proposal. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. As noted above, the company’s shareholders will also vote on the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the decision of the creditors differs from the decision of the shareholders, the former will prevail unless a shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders that the decision of the shareholders should prevail.

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings in respect of the Northern Irish Guarantors are likely to be",1259.8.12,Liquidation/winding-up,"The Northern Irish Guarantors may be wound up under the laws of NI. By “wound up” the Group means placed into either Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation or Compulsory Liquidation, both of which are insolvent liquidations. The Group is not referring to the process of Members’ Voluntary Liquidation which is a solvent winding up and outside the scope of this analysis. Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) (see “—Priority on insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The key difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the Courts of Northern Ireland general jurisdiction, members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in Northern Ireland. On the liquidation of a Northern Irish company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place preventing, amongst other things, the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests. Where a Northern Irish Guarantor is placed into Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation, there are no restrictions on the holder of security either by way of fixed or floating charge from taking steps to enforce those security interests unless the liquidator or any creditor has applied to a court for a stay. However, where a Northern Irish Guarantor is placed into Compulsory Liquidation, the consent of the Court is strictly required before any security interest can be enforced and a court order would be required to place the company into administration. In addition, with compulsory liquidation where the obligations under the Guarantee are unsecured because of some inherent defect in the security interest, that guarantor cannot take action or commence proceedings to recover the amounts due on foot of the guarantee without the consent of the Court by virtue of Article 110(3) of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Article 107 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended), any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations (as defined herein) and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a windingup order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Article 107 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended). There is also no automatic stay in ----- the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). Once a winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings will also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the Company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or debt as a debt in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings in respect of the Northern Irish Guarantors are likely to be",1259.8.13,Priority on insolvency,"One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under Northern Irish law is to realize the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. In accordance with the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) and the Insolvency Rules (Northern Ireland) 1991 (as amended), creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency setoff applies). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt); - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part 1A of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) and within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses ----- of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid; - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include claims by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential debts; - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors; - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent the realizations from those secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges the Prescribed Part must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Seventh ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate applicable to a money judgment of the High Court on the day on which the company went into liquidation) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This, however, does not include “currency conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. ----- Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court grants an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/ 3226)), as set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In most cases, this will only arise if the Northern Irish company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to a Northern Irish company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company, or certain transitions entered into by the company. _Onset of insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is made, (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date on which the windingup petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director or shadow director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under Northern Irish law to guarantees and security interests: ----- _Transaction at an undervalue_ Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could apply to the Court for an Order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a gift or transfer for no or significantly less consideration. There will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the Northern Irish company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989). The transaction is subject to potential challenge if the Northern Irish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the Northern Irish company grants the security interest or guarantee. However, a Northern Irish court generally will not intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and if at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. The Issuer cannot assure holders of the Notes that in the event of insolvency, the granting of the security by companies incorporated under the laws of NI would not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support the analysis that (in any event) the guarantee was entered into in good faith for the purposes described above. If a Northern Irish court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the Northern Irish court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the Northern Irish company in such proceedings to rebut such a presumption. _Preference_ Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could apply to a Northern Irish court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. There will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was entered into, the Northern Irish company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended) or the Northern Irish company becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended) as a consequence of its entry into the transaction. The transaction can be challenged if the Northern Irish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the Northern Irish company takes the decision to grant the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Northern Irish company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If a Northern Irish court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could, in this case, include reducing payments under the Notes and the Guarantees (although there is protection for a third-party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for a Northern Irish court to do so, it must be shown that in deciding to give the preference the Northern Irish company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. _Transaction defrauding creditors_ Under Northern Irish insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and the Northern Irish court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the Northern Irish court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration). In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the Northern Irish court in the case of a company in ----- administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit in the Northern Irish insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If a Northern Irish court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, a Northern Irish court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a third-party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator of a Northern Irish company can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. Where an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. _Avoidance of floating charge_ Under Northern Irish insolvency law, if a Northern Irish obligor is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then such floating charge can be avoided except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant Northern Irish obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. The requirement for the Northern Irish obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant Northern Irish obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant Northern Irish obligor is solvent or insolvent. The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant Northern Irish obligor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant Northern Irish obligor grants the floating charge. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the 2003 Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Should any Northern Irish company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the Courts of Northern Ireland, any proceedings opened in Northern Ireland would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Northern Ireland. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in a Northern Irish compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Northern Ireland, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the Northern Irish court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non-main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the Courts of Northern Ireland). ----- Northern Irish insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by the Northern Irish Guarantors and any security interests granted by the Northern Irish Guarantors.

Under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, each relevant RoI Obligor’s center of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. RoI) in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the relevant RoI Obligor did not move its registered office within the 3 months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings. As each RoI Obligor’s COMI is presumed to be RoI, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the relevant RoI Obligor would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of RoI. As to what might constitute “proof to _the contrary” regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in_ _Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd_ [2004] 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); [2006] IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); [2006] Ch 508; ECJ Case C-341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the European Court of Justice concluded that “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties” would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual situation is different from that which the location of its registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in RoI does not carry on any business in RoI, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in RoI. However, if a company with its registered office in RoI does carry on business in RoI, the fact that its economic choices are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the presumption. If the relevant RoI Obligor’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in RoI, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead. RoI insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by the RoI Guarantors and any security interests granted by the RoI Guarantors.

Under RoI law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to be created by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is ----- not determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. In addition, to the extent that any of the assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are not specifically identified, the court may hold that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Preferential debts therefore have priority over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to the floating charge. Section 621 was amended by the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 (with effect from 9 June 2017) with the effect that a charge created as a floating charge by a company will continue to rank as a floating charge on a winding-up of that company, even if that floating charge has crystallized. Under Section 440 (Preferential Payments when receiver _appointed under floating charge) of the Companies Act, the holder of a floating charge, or a receiver appointed_ by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating charge when the company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of that property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the RoI Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value added tax (VAT), employee-related taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation. In addition, there is a further limited category of super-preferential creditors which take priority, not only over unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These super-preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the RoI courts, (see “—Examinership” and “SCARP _process” below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of the company by a liquidator,_ receiver or mortgagee in possession as well as, in certain circumstances, PAYE and VAT arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created. Furthermore, and as referred to above (see “—Fixed and floating charges”), in the case of the application of moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a winding-up, the costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees will take priority over the claims of floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In circumstances where an RoI company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that company, the directors of that company, a contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that company, or shareholders of that company holding, at the date of presentation of the petition, not less than one-tenth of the paid-up voting share capital of that company are each entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner to that company. Provided the company can demonstrate its survival (and all or part of its undertaking) as a going concern, and can satisfy certain tests, the RoI company may be placed under the protection of the relevant Irish court for a period of time whilst its affairs are investigated by an independent examiner whose function is to see whether the company is capable of being rescued and to supervise the restructuring process. Where the relevant Irish court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter, make an order appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the Companies Act to a related company of such company. Once confirmed by the relevant Irish court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members and creditors. During the protection period the day-to-day business of the company ----- remains under the control of the directors of the company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the relevant Irish court. Once appointed an examiner must, as soon as practical, formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement in relation to the company to which he has been appointed. Typically, a scheme of arrangement will involve the writing down of creditors’ claims (both secured and unsecured, contingent and actual) that are in existence at the date of the petition and the introduction into the company of new funds. The examiner has the power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the examiner may sell assets of the company which are the subject of security. Where such assets are the subject of a fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed security interest for the amount realized and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale. Having formulated his proposals, he must convene meetings of such classes of members and creditors as he thinks proper to consider acceptance of his proposals. The examiner must report to the Court on the outcome of his meetings within 35 days of his appointment, although the 35 day period can be extended by the Court. There is acceptance by creditors or by a class of creditors when a majority in number representing a majority in value of the claims represented at the meeting vote in favor of the proposals. The proposals must be confirmed by the Court if they are to become effective and the Court can confirm the proposals only if, inter alia: (a) a majority in number of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by implementation of the proposals, representing a majority in value of the claims that would be impaired by implementation of the proposals, have voted to accept the proposals; (b) if the abovementioned requirement (a) is not satisfied, then a majority of the classes of creditors whose interests would be impaired by the scheme of arrangement have voted to accept them, provided that, at least one of those creditor classes is a class of secured creditors or is senior to the class of ordinary unsecured creditors; or (c) if the abovementioned requirement (b) is not satisfied, at least one class of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by the proposals, other than a class which would not receive any payment or keep any interest in liquidation, has voted to accept them; and (d) no dissenting creditor would be worse off if the proposals are confirmed and implemented than such a creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied, either in the event of liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if the proposals were not confirmed. Once confirmed by the Court, the proposals become binding on the company and all creditors (whether secured or unsecured) or the class or classes of creditors (whether secured or unsecured), as the case may be, affected by the proposals and their rights are accordingly modified. For as long as a company is under the protection of the relevant Irish court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or execution shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company except with the consent of the examiner. Section 520 (Effect of petition to appoint examiner on creditors and others) of the Companies Act provides, among other things, that except with the consent of the examiner: - where any claim against the company is secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance or a pledge of, on or affecting the whole or any part of the property, effects or income of the RoI company, no action may be taken to realize the whole or any part of such security; - no receiver over any part of the property or undertaking of the RoI company shall be appointed (and if a receiver was appointed before the petition was presented, that receiver was unable to act); and - no proceedings for the winding up of the company may be commenced and no resolution for winding up of the company may be passed (and no such resolution passed shall have any effect). In addition, pursuant to Section 521 (Restriction on payment of pre-petition debts) of the Companies Act, no payment may be made by a company during the period of Court protection by way of satisfaction or discharge of the whole or a part of a liability incurred by the company before the date upon which the petition for the examiner’s appointment was presented unless the independent expert’s report under Section 511 (Independent _expert’s report) of the Companies Act that accompanied the petition recommended that all or part of that liability_ be discharged or satisfied, or such payment is authorized by the Relevant Irish court (on application of the examiner or any interested party) where the Relevant Irish court is satisfied that a failure to discharge or satisfy in whole or in part that liability would considerably reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking surviving as a going concern. The Companies Act allows for the renumeration, costs and expenses of the examiner which have been sanctioned by an order of the court (other than the expenses that, by virtue of section 529 of the Companies Act, are treated as expenses properly incurred by the examiner) to be paid prior to any other claims including secured claims. Section 529 of the Companies Act provides that any liabilities ----- incurred by a company in examinership which are certified by the examiner which have been incurred in circumstances where, in the opinion of the examiner, the survival of the company under court protection as a going concern during the period would otherwise be seriously prejudiced, shall be treated as expenses properly incurred for the purposes of Section 554 of the Companies Act but will rank behind the claims of creditors secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance of a fixed nature or a pledge. Nonetheless, if the court sanctions borrowings by an examiner as part of the expenses of the examiner pursuant to Section 554 of the Companies Act, such borrowings will rank ahead of the claims of both unsecured creditors and creditors secured by a floating charge of the company under court protection. Where an examinership petition is presented in relation to a company, that company is deemed to be under the protection of the Court during the period beginning on presentation of the petition and ending 70 days later (which period may be extended by a further 30 days where the Court is satisfied that the examiner would not be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further unlimited period as the Court may allow where the Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in the examiner’s final report). In the event of an appeal of the Court’s decision, the protection period is likely to be further extended in order to allow the determination of the appeal. Furthermore, the Relevant Irish court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator appointed by the Relevant Irish court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference. _Primary risks for Holders of Notes in an examinership_ The primary risks to the holders of the Notes, under the laws of RoI, if an examiner were appointed to an RoI Obligor and/or to a company related to such an RoI company and where any amounts due under the Notes were unpaid, are as follows: (a) there may be a delay in enforcing the payment obligations of an RoI Obligor of the Notes and of any payment obligations contained in a guarantee given by any other related company subject to the examinership proceedings; (b) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by an RoI Obligor to the holders of the Notes; (c) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of any payment obligations owed to the holders of the Notes by a company related to such an RoI Obligor; (d) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the RoI Obligor to enable the examiner to borrow to fund the guarantor or issuer during the protection period; and (e) in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved in respect of an RoI Obligor and the RoI Obligor subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of the guarantor and approved by the RoI High Court) will take priority over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by it to the holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is appointed to the RoI company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the security or giving of the guarantee and, in addition, the company was “unable to pay its debts” when the security interest was granted or when the guarantee was given or “unable to pay its debts” within the meaning of the Companies Act as a result. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests and guarantees: _Unfair preference_ Under Irish insolvency law, if an RoI company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court to have certain transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference. Section 604 (Unfair preference: effect of winding up on antecedent and other transactions) of the Companies Act (“Section 604”) provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favor of any creditor of the company or any person on trust for any such creditor, with a view to giving such creditor (or any surety or guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) a preference over the company’s other creditors, shall be deemed to be an unfair preference of its creditors and be invalid accordingly if a winding up of the company commences within six months of the doing of the act and the company is, at the date of commencement of the winding up, unable to pay its debts (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). ----- _Improperly transferred assets_ Under Section 608 (Power of the court to order return of assets which have been improperly transferred) of the Companies Act (“Section 608”), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on the company, its creditors or members, the High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have “use, control or possession” of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit. The ability to use Section 608 to challenge the transfer of assets has been extended to receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that would constitute an unfair preference for the purposes of Section 604. _Disclaimer of onerous contracts_ Under Section 615 (Disclaimer of onerous property in case of company being wound up) of the Companies Act, the liquidator of a company may, by the giving of notice, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous property” is defined to include any “unprofitable contract” and “any other property (of the _company) which is unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the possessor of it to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money.” Grant of floating charge_ Under Section 597 (Circumstances in which floating charge is invalid) of the Companies Act, a floating charge is invalid if created in the period of twelve months (or two years if created in favor of a “connected person”) ending with the date of commencement of the winding up of the company, and unless it can be proven that the company was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such invalidity does not apply to money actually advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or services sold or supplied to the company at the time or after the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge together with interest at the appropriate rate. _General_ If an RoI Obligor becomes subject to an RoI law insolvency proceeding and that company has obligations to creditors that are treated under RoI law as senior relative to the company’s obligations to the Noteholders, the Noteholders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceeding. The validity and enforceability of a guarantee or security interest may be contested on the basis that it is prohibited under the relevant company’s constitution. To the extent that the constitution does not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantees may be found to be void and unenforceable. Further, guarantees by the Irish guarantors for the obligations of another group company must be in the commercial interest and for the corporate benefit of the Irish guarantors. If the giving of a guarantee is not for the Irish guarantors’ corporate benefit, the guarantees could be held null and void. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees. The question whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact, which must be assessed by the competent body of the company being the board of directors of the company acting bona fide in the interest of the company. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the company for negligence in the management of the company. Moreover, the guarantees could be declared null and void. The validity and/or enforceability of the guarantees may also be subject to the statutes of limitations, defences such as set-off or counterclaim, the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of estoppel, and the fact that equitable remedies will only be granted by the Irish court in its discretion. Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 82 (Financial assistance for acquisition of shares) of the Companies Act (“Section 82”), it is unlawful for a RoI company to give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for any shares in the company or its holding company. As a result, the notes may only be guaranteed by the relevant RoI company to the extent that it would not result in such guarantee constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance under Section 82. ----- Pursuant to Section 1001 of the RoI Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over book debts of an RoI tax-resident company may be required by notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners to pay to them sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment of debts due to it by the relevant company. Where the holder of the security has informed the RoI Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding RoI tax liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issue to the holder of a notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners. The RoI Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an RoI tax-resident company by another person in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right of the RoI Revenue Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among others) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules of international law; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy; - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the ----- Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England.

Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, would not be directly enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such a monetary judgment in Northern Ireland, under common law rules proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Northern Ireland (a “Northern Irish court”). Summary judgment may be applied for and in this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally will not (subject to the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court if: - the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK rules of private international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and - the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law). A Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established that: - the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in Northern Ireland; - the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained); - the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject of a final judgment of a Northern Irish court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable in Northern Ireland; - the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice were breached; ----- - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit); or - an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant U.S. court.

A judgment of the courts of the State of New York will be enforced by the courts of the RoI if the following general requirements are met: (1) the courts of the State of New York must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant according to RoI conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant would satisfy this rule); and (2) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is pending.

It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and conclusive. However, the RoI courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the courts of the State of New York which meets the above requirements for one of the following reasons: (1) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money; (2) if the judgment was obtained by fraud; (3) the enforcement of the judgment in the RoI would be contrary to natural or constitutional justice; (4) the judgment is contrary to RoI public policy or involves certain United States laws which will not be enforced in the RoI; or (5) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement proceedings by personal service in the RoI or outside the RoI under Order 11 of the Superior Courts Rules. Pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 of November 22, 1996, as amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1100 (the “Blocking Statute”), no judgment of a court or tribunal and no decision of an administrative authority located outside of the European Union giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the laws specified in the annex to the Blocking Statute or to actions based thereon will be recognized or be enforceable in any manner by the courts of the Republic of Ireland. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

451_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,,25.1.1,,"Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement dated         , 2023 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among, _inter alios, the Issuer and each of the Initial Purchasers, each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, and the Issuer have agreed to sell, all of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase and accept delivery of the Notes offered hereby are subject to certain conditions precedent. The Initial Purchasers are obligated to purchase and accept delivery of all the Notes if any are purchased. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, in addition to their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the Notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms without notice. Persons who purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S, provided that investors resident in a Member State of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom are not retail investors (as defined herein), and (ii) in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state or territory of the United States or any other jurisdiction. The terms used above in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes (including the Guarantees) will be restricted and each purchaser of the Notes (including the Guarantees) in the United States will be required to make certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements, as described under “Notice to Investors.” In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the Notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each distributor, dealer or person to whom it sells such Notes during such 40 day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the Offering may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA, received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. The Issuer expects the delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the respective Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the      business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on any date prior to two business days before delivery will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. ----- The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 60 days after the Issue Date, none of the Issuer or the Guarantors will, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft and Goldman Sachs International, offer, sell, contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, any debt or convertible securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that are substantially similar to the Notes. The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. In addition, the Issuer will pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain fees and expenses relating to the Offering. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, over-allotments, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales or over-allotments. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the Offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes while the Offering is in progress. These stabilization activities by Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. There is no obligation on Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc to conduct these activities. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers expect to make offers and sales both inside and outside the United States through their respective selling agents. Any offers and sales in the United States will be conducted by broker-dealers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, by the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes and the Guarantees or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Group or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.

The Initial Purchasers are not obliged, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. In addition, recent amendments to Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and regulatory interpretations thereof may restrict the ability of brokers and dealers to publish quotations on the notes on any interdealer quotation system or other quotation medium after January 4, 2025. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

F-176 ----- ### Energia Group Limited consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2023 ----- ## INDEPENDENT  AUDITORS’ REPORT #### Opinion ###### We have audited the financial statements of Energia Group Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 33, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. In our opinion the financial statements: • give a true and fair view of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of its profit for the year then ended; and • have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. #### Basis for opinion ###### We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for our opinion. #### Conclusions relating to going concern ###### In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. ----- ###### Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. #### Other information ###### The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. #### Responsibilities of directors ###### As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 82, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. ----- #### Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements ###### Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. ###### • We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and the relevant direct and indirect tax compliance regulation in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Cayman Islands. In addition, the Group has to comply with laws and regulations relating to its operations, including health and safety, employees, data protection, anti-bribery and corruption and Electricity regulations in respect of the Group generation and supply activities. • We understood how Energia Group Limited is complying with those frameworks by making enquires of management, internal audit and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated our enquires through our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence. • We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s consolidated financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by utilising internal and external information to perform a fraud risk assessment. • We determined that there was a fraud risk associated with overstatement of revenue arising either by overstatement of unbilled revenue estimates or by understatement of provisions for I-SEM resettlement revenue adjustments.  Our testing of revenue in response to the identified fraud risks included; ----- ###### understanding the process for management estimation which included challenge of all key assumptions; testing and sensitivity analysis on assumptions; and performing a retrospective review of prior period estimates to determine management’s accuracy within the estimation process. We also considered post year end invoicing and revenue settlement to confirm managements estimation accuracy and performed analytical review procedures to assess movements according to expectations. Furthermore, we performed procedures on a sample of revenue transactions in the financial period to test existence, valuation and cut off. • We also identified impairment of goodwill and PPE (Property, Plant and Equipment) as a significant risk. Our procedures included: obtaining an understanding of the process undertaken by management; assessment of appropriateness of CGUs considered by management; review of and assessment of the reasonableness of the method used and key assumptions included in respective impairment models, including corroborating to externally available data and by using internal specialists where necessary; sensitisation of assumptions used in impairment models; determination of our own point estimate and checking the mathematical accuracy of the impairment models. • In addition, we considered the risk of fraud through management override which included key significant risk areas such as expected credit loss provisions and, in response, we incorporated testing ###### manual journals and designed procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on journal meeting our defined risk criteria based on our understanding of the business, enquires of legal counsel, group and component team management and internal audit. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. #### Use of our report ###### This report is made solely to the company’s directors, as a body, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 10 March 2021.

CORPORATE INFORMATION ###### The consolidated financial statements of Energia Group Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) for the year ended 31 March 2023 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Director on 1 June 2023. Energia Group Limited (the Company or the parent) is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the Cayman Islands. The registered office is located at PO Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. The Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out earlier in the Report on pages 8 to 9. #### 2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION ###### The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2023. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, contingent consideration arising on business combinations and the assets of the Group’s pension schemes that have been measured at fair value and the liabilities of the Group’s pension schemes that are measured using the projected unit credit valuation method. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros with all values rounded to the nearest million (€m) except where otherwise indicated. Going Concern The Group’s business activities, together with the principal risks and uncertainties likely to affect its future performance are described in the Strategic and Director’s Report. ###### In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting, a detailed monthly analysis of forecast future cashflows has been prepared by management. The forecasts were based on key assumptions including fuel prices (applying forward curves for commodities) and market demand (applying growth factors in line with publicly available forecasts and internal assessment). In preparing the forecasts, consideration was also given to the Group’s Sterling Senior secured notes of £225m which are due to mature on 15 September 2024. Notwithstanding that the Group has a number of refinancing options available to it, the base case cash flow analysis shows that the Group has sufficient financial headroom to enable repayment of the notes in full out of cash reserves, on or before the maturity date. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken in relation to the key assumptions to reflect the impact of reduced demand together with potential delays in customers paying their bills. In all scenarios tested, the Group has sufficient financial headroom and was able to operate within the minimum EBITDA covenant contained within its Senior revolving credit facility. Having considered the matters above, the Director has a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of 12 months from the signing of the financial statements and, therefore, continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. ----- #### 2.2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION ###### The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2023. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: • power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); • exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and • the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. #### 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) New and amended standards  and interpretations ###### Certain standards and amendments apply for the first time in this set of financial statements, but do not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. #### (b) Business combinations and goodwill ###### Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred and measured at acquisition date fair value, and (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement in accordance with IFRS 9. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IFRS 9, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent ----- ###### consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non- controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. If a subsidiary is subsequently sold any goodwill arising on acquisition which has not been impaired is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale. #### (c) Fair value measurement ###### The Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at each balance sheet date at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: • In the principal market for the asset or liability; or • In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. ###### The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: • level 1 - quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •  level 2 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable; or •  level 3 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. ----- ###### For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re- assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. #### (d) Revenue from contracts with customers ###### Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services provided in the normal course of business, exclusive of value added tax and other sales related taxes. The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised Renewable generation The key revenue streams derived from the Renewable generation businesses include the generation of electricity through wholly owned wind assets and third party contracted PPAs across the Island of Ireland together with the sale of ROCs generated from the assets in NI. Revenue in relation to electricity generation is recognised over time and is only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue generated from the I-SEM is settled both weekly and monthly in line with market settlement timelines, while ###### revenue generated from ROCs are recognised at a point in time and settled in line with contractual settlement terms. Flexible generation Two key revenue streams are received by the Flexible Generation businesses Huntstown and PPB. Capacity revenue is recognised based upon the capacity (MW) provided to the I-SEM. Energy revenue is recognised based upon electricity units generated during the period at market price, including an allowance for any anticipated resettlement within the I-SEM. Units are based on energy volumes recorded by SEMO and these units are reconciled to the units recorded on the plant systems to ensure accuracy. Revenue in relation to electricity generation is recognised over time and is only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue generated from the I-SEM is settled both weekly and monthly in line with market settlement timelines. Revenue in relation to Huntstown’s emergency generation project is recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 with development fees recognised over time and development milestone payments recognised at the point when the milestones are achieved, Customer solutions Revenue is recognised on the basis of electricity and gas supplied during the period. This includes an assessment of electricity and gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the balance sheet date, estimated using historical consumption patterns. Revenue for electricity and gas is recognised over time and only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue recognised includes variable consideration in respect of estimated market resettlement. Electricity and gas ----- ###### revenues are invoiced on a monthly, bi-monthly and quarterly basis with standard credit terms of 14 days for residential customers. Credit terms for business customers vary by contract. Energy Price Guarantee The Energy Price Guarantee Scheme (EPG) was introduced in Northern Ireland in November 2022 by the UK government. The EPG protects domestic customers in NI from high energy costs by applying a discount to the unit rate of electricity charged. Following the implementation of the EPG (and for the duration of the scheme) the revenue recognised for these customers is, in line with IFRS 15, based on the volume of units supplied and the discounted tariff as determined by scheme rules. The government will pay the difference between the normal tariff and the discounted rate with amounts received from the government recognised as Other income within the profit and loss account. The Government pays weekly in arrears with the amounts due from the UK government included in Contract assets (accrued income). Energy Bills Support Scheme (EBSS) and Alternative Fuels Payment (AFP) A single non-repayable support payment totaling £600 was made by the UK Government to all households in NI (£400 under the Energy Bills Support Scheme and £200 under the Alternative Fuels Payment). Acting on behalf of the UK Government, Power NI administered delivery of the support payments to its residential electricity customers in the form of a direct payment to Direct Debit customers or a voucher redeemable at the Post Office for Prepayment and Non-Direct Debit credit customers. Cash received from the government in relation to the scheme is held in a restricted ###### bank account and is not freely available in the normal course of business, Power NI are entitled to draw money from the restricted account once payments have been made directly to customers or to the Post Office under the voucher scheme. Any surplus funds held in the account after cessation of the scheme in June 2023 will be returned to the UK government. Inframarginal Revenue Cap In October 2022, EU Member States formally adopted a Regulation introducing measures to mitigate high energy prices which included a revenue cap on inframarginal electricity generating companies including intermediaries. The Irish government agreed a cap of €120 MWh for wind and solar generators to apply from 1 December 2022 – 30 June 2023. The Capped revenue is calculated by multiplying the generating unit’s relevant quantity (using data provided by Eirgrid & ESB Networks) by the relevant level of the cap (€120 per MWh for wind) on a monthly basis with any excess revenue above the cap due to be paid to the government. Accordingly, a provision has been recognised based on the difference between capped revenue and actual market revenue received. Contract balances Contract assets (accrued income) A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group performs its obligation by transferring goods or services to a customer and an invoice has not yet been raised, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration. Trade receivables A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional ----- ###### (i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to financial assets accounting policies below. Contract liabilities (payments on account) A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group has transferred goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is received. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs its performance obligation. #### (e) Taxation ###### The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity. Tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the ###### balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences where they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. ----- ###### Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised in profit or loss. #### (f) Property, plant and equipment ###### Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if  the recognition criteria for a provision are met. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis ###### so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: •   Thermal generation assets       12 to 30 years • Renewable generation assets 20 years • Fixtures and equipment 5 to 25 years • Vehicles and mobile plant 3 to 5 years #### (g) Intangible assets ###### Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.  The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement as the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets. ----- ###### Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. Emissions allowances, renewable and energy efficiency obligations The Group recognises purchased CO2 emissions allowances, ROCs and energy efficiency credits (EECs) initially at cost (purchase price) within intangible assets and subsequently written down to their recoverable amount at the balance sheet date should this be less than the purchase price. Self-generated ROCs are initially recorded at fair value within intangible assets with a corresponding credit to energy costs in the income statement, and subsequently written down to their recoverable amount at the balance sheet date should this be less than the fair value on initial recognition. No amortisation is recorded during the period as the intangible asset is surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the consumption of economic benefit. Emission allowances, energy efficiency obligations and ROCs will be realised within twelve months. The Group recognises liabilities in respect of its obligations to deliver emissions allowances to the extent that the allowances to be delivered ###### exceed the level of allocation under the EU emissions trading scheme. Any liabilities recognised are measured based on the current estimates of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the obligation. A liability for the renewables obligation and the climate change Levy is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers. A liability for the energy efficiency obligation under the EEOS is recognised if energy saving minimum targets are not achieved by the end of the compliance period. Any such liability is recognised on the compliance date (31 December) and is calculated by reference to the relevant penalty rates for volumes not achieved. Computer software The cost of acquiring computer software is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the Director’s estimate of its useful economic life which is between three and five years. The carrying value of computer software is reviewed for impairment where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value  may not be recoverable. Development assets Development assets arising from business combinations relate to value arising from the development of renewable projects which the Group believes will generate future economic benefits. Development assets are amortised from the date of commissioning of the renewable asset over its useful economic life which is twenty years. At a point the project is no longer expected to reach construction the carrying amount of the project is impaired. Customer acquisition costs ----- ###### The incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract within the Customer Solutions businesses are capitalised and amortised on a basis that reflects the transfer of goods or services to the customer. #### (h) Leases ###### Right-of-use assets The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Leases of land and buildings generally have lease terms between 5 and 25 years, while motor vehicles and other equipment generally have lease terms between 3 and 5 years. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments ###### of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in- substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. #### (i) Financial instruments - initial recognition and subsequent measurement ###### A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. ----- ###### Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and fair value through the profit or loss. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets’ contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price under IFRS 15. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘Solely Payments of Principal and Interest’ (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. The Group’s business model for management of financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether the cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified in four categories: ###### • Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments); • Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments); • Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); and • Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments) This category is the most relevant to the Group. The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: • The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and • The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified, or impaired. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables. Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. ----- ###### Financial assets at fair value through  profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9. The Group has not designated any financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair value presented as finance costs (negative net changes in fair value) or finance income (positive net changes in fair value) in the income statement. Derecognition A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group’s consolidated balance sheet) when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. Impairment of financial assets The Group recognises an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. ###### ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposure for which there has not been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12 month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL). For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applied a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognised a loss allowance based on the lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 120 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicated that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. Interest income For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the EIR method. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments ----- ###### or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. Interest income is included in finance income in the income statement. #### Financial liabilities ###### Initial recognition and measurement The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps, contracts for differences and forward commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, interest rate risks, electricity price risk and other commodity price risks, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments. Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The ###### EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. This category generally applies to interest bearing loans and borrowings. This category also applies to trade and other payables which are not interest bearing and stated at their nominal amount. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. #### (j) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting ###### Initial recognition and subequent measurement The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps, contracts for differences and forward commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, interest rate risks, electricity price risk and other commodity price risks, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. The purchase contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement as operating costs. ----- ###### Commodity contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are held at cost. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in other comprehensive income and later reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss. For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: • fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment; • cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment; or • hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness ###### of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Hedges that meet the strict criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are accounted for, as described below: Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement in operating costs. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments, as well as forward commodity contracts for its exposure to volatility in the commodity prices. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency and commodity contracts is recognised in operating costs. The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in ----- ###### equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in other comprehensive income for the period. For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flows occur, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above. #### (k) Impairment of non-financial assets ###### The Group assesses at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing ###### value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre- tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying ----- ###### amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. The following assets have specific characteristics for impairment testing: Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. #### (l) Cash and cash equivalents ###### Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits with a maturity of less than three months. #### (m) Provisions ###### Decommissioning liability Provision is made for estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the estimated useful lives of generation assets on a discounted basis based on price levels and technology at the balance sheet date. Changes in these estimates and changes to the discount rates are added to or deducted from the capitalised cost of the asset to which they relate. Capitalised decommissioning costs are ###### depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. #### (n) Exceptional items and certain remeasurements ###### As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial statements, the Group has disclosed additional information in respect of exceptional items on the face of the income statement to aid understanding of the Group’s financial performance. An item is treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by nature and scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. “Certain remeasurements” are remeasurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships, and which are accounted for as held for trading in accordance with the Group’s policy for such financial instruments. This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group’s own use requirements. Certain remeasurements arising from IFRS 9 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. #### (o) Pensions and other post-employment benefits ###### The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements. The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of liabilities represents the present value of the obligations offset by the fair value of assets. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method. ----- ###### Pension remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding net interest), and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Pension remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of: • the date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and • the date that the Group recognises restructuring-related costs. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under operating costs in the consolidated income statement: • service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and • net interest expense or income. Pension costs in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable. However, paragraph 64 of IAS 19 Employee Benefits (2011) limits the measurement of the defined benefit asset to the ‘present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.’ IFRIC 14 addresses the interaction between a minimum funding requirement and the limit placed by paragraph 64 of IAS 19 on the measurement of the defined benefit asset or liability. ###### When determining the limit on a defined benefit asset in accordance with IAS 19.64, under IFRIC 14 entities are required to measure any economic benefits available to them in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions at the maximum amount that is consistent with the terms and conditions of the plan and any statutory requirements in the jurisdiction of the plan. The entity’s intentions on how to use a surplus (for instance, whether the entity intends to improve benefits rather than reduce contributions or get a refund) must be disregarded. Such economic benefits are regarded as available to an entity if the entity has an unconditional right to realise them at some point during the life of the plan or when the plan is settled, even if they are not realisable immediately at the balance sheet date. Such an unconditional right would not exist when the availability of the refund or the reduction in future contribution would be contingent upon factors beyond the entity’s control (for example, approval by third parties such as plan trustees). To the extent the right  is contingent, no asset would be recognised. #### (p) Inventories ###### Inventories are valued at the lower of average purchase price and net realisable value. #### (q) Borrowing costs ###### Borrowing costs directly attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. #### (r) Foreign currency translation ###### The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro. Energia Group Limited’s functional currency is sterling. For each entity the ----- ###### Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Euro at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their income statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on ###### translation for consolidation are recognised in other comprehensive income. #### (s) Share-based payments ###### Employees (senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity- settled transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 32. That cost is recognised in employee benefits expense (note 9), together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the consolidated income statement for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated ----- ###### service requirement, are considered to be non- vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and / or performance conditions. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and / or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and / or service conditions are satisfied. When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair value of the unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms of the award are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of modification, is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss. #### (t) Government grant ###### Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. ###### When the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the asset, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments. #### (u) Deferred Income ###### Capital contributions received in respect of property, plant and equipment are deferred and released to revenue in the income statement by instalments over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. #### (v) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions ###### The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and operating costs during the year. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Judgements In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: Exceptional items and certain remeasurements The Group has disclosed additional information in respect of exceptional items on the face of the income statement to aid understanding of the Group’s financial performance. An item is ----- ###### treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by nature and scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. “Certain remeasurements” are remeasurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships, and which are accounted for as held for trading in accordance with the Group’s policy for such financial instruments. This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group’s own use requirements. Exceptional items and certain remeasurements have been outlined in note 7. Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. Revenue recognition Revenue on energy sales include an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This will have been estimated by using historical consumption patterns. At the balance sheet date, the estimated consumption by customers will either have been billed or accrued (estimated unbilled ###### revenue). Management apply judgement to the measurement of the quantum and valuation of the estimated consumption, including an estimate in respect of the impact of increased commodity prices, inflation and interest rates  that may impact the Group customers’ ability to pay. At 31 March 2023 the level of unbilled revenue not recognised was €37.6m (2022 - €44.7m). The judgements applied and the assumptions underpinning these judgements are considered to be appropriate. However, for every 1% change in these assumptions the impact upon the amount of revenue recognised would be €1.5m. Revenue recognised in the period has been outlined in note 5. Impairment testing The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that the value of those assets is impaired. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the assets are allocated which includes the estimation of future cash flows and the application of a suitable discount rate. Subsequent changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the assets within the respective CGUs. Impairment testing has been outlined in note 14. Business combinations Business combinations require a fair value exercise to be undertaken to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based to a considerable extent on management’s judgement. The amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of this purchase ----- ###### price to the identifiable assets and liabilities with any unallocated portion being recorded as goodwill. Business combinations have been outlined in note 15. Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit method. The key assumptions used in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits are set after consultation with qualified actuaries. While these assumptions are considered to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group. Pensions and other post-employment benefits have been outlined in note 23. Credit provisions for trade receivables The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and uses a provision matrix. The matrix approach allows application of different rates to different groups of customers with similar characteristics. The provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates. The Group then calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward- looking information. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. The Group has adjusted the ECL matrix for the forecast impact of the current economic environment including the impact of higher sustained energy costs, higher inflation and interest rate increases impacting the Group customers’ both businesses and residential. ###### Information on the ECLs on the Group’s trade receivables and contract assets together with further detail relating to the adjustments is disclosed in note 18. Provision for I-SEM resettlement The I-SEM market trading arrangements, which comprise a Day Ahead Market, Intra-Day Market and Balancing Market, experienced volatility since the market commenced on 1 October 2018. The market has become more stable, with a number of fixes applied by the Market Operator, however the Group’s energy purchase and supply businesses remain exposed to some energy price resettlement risks. As at 31 March 2023 the Market Operator has resettled these markets up to 3 December 2022 for M+4 resettlement and 5 March 2022 for M+13 resettlement in line with the expected market resettlement timetable of 4 months and 13 months after initial settlement. The market has had two main system fixes released over the last year however further market fixes are required to be implemented before the market settlement solution can be considered fully aligned to the market code requirements, with a number of additional resettlements to occur ranging across the full 54-month period since the market commenced. The Group therefore continues to be exposed to potential price resettlements in the balancing market and estimates the level of resettlement that may be applied. These estimates are based on known market anomalies as discussed in industry forums and facts and circumstances known at the Balance Sheet date. Estimations are dependent on the resettlement approach taken by the market operator. There is therefore a significant degree of judgement required in order to estimate the level of resettlement that will be applied. The current year estimate of on average c.1.6% from October 2018 (2022 – c.3.5% for all ----- ###### periods from October 2018) of balancing market revenues is considered a reasonable estimate and is supported by actual resettlements seen in the market to date, and reflect the various fixes applied by the market operator during the past 12 months. A quantitative sensitivity analysis in relation to these key assumptions shows that, for every 1% increase or decrease in the percentage used in the resettlement provisions for balancing market exposures would be an increase or decrease to operating profit respectively of €3.8m. #### (w) Standards issued but not yet effective ###### The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of the issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective. Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify: •  What is meant by a right to defer settlement •  That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period •  That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right ###### •  That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and must be applied retrospectively. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to IAS 8 In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8, in which it introduces a definition of ‘accounting estimates’. The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and apply to changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start of that period. Earlier application is permitted as long as this fact is disclosed. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. ----- ###### Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, in which it provides guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments to IAS 1 are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 with earlier application permitted. Since the amendments to the Practice Statement 2 provide non-mandatory guidance on the application of the definition of material to accounting policy information, an effective date for these amendments is not necessary. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. ###### Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to IAS 12 In May 2021, the Board issued amendments to IAS 12, which narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendments are effective from 1 January 2023 should be applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, deferred tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred tax liability should also be recognised for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. #### 4. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS ###### For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services and has three reportable segments, as follows: (i) Renewables The Renewables business owns and operates 309MW of wind assets and purchases electricity from 1,247MW of renewable generation capacity throughout Ireland. ----- ###### (ii) Flexible Generation Consists of electricity generation from the Group’s two Huntstown CCGT plants and development of emergency gas generation capacity at Huntstown (currently under construction and targeted to be commissioned in Second Half 2024) together with operation of a 50MW battery storage facility in Belfast and the (iii) Customer Solutions Consists of the competitive supply of electricity and gas to business and residential customers in the RoI through its brand Energia, together with the supply of electricity to residential and business customers in NI through its brand Power NI. #### (a) Revenue by segment ###### The Group’s Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions with regard to resource allocation and performance assessment. The measure of profit used by the Board is pro- forma EBITDA which is operating profit before exceptional items and certain remeasurements (arising from certain commodity and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships) and based on regulated entitlement (whereby the adjustment for over / (under) - recovery outlined in the segmental analysis below represents the amount by which the regulated businesses over / (under) - recovered against their regulated entitlement). The Board also monitors revenue on a regulated entitlement basis. |Col1|2023 €m|2022 €m| |---|---|---| |Renewables|427.2|401.9| |Flexible Generation|1,769.7|989.5| |Customer Solutions|2,345.2|1,780.1| |Inter-group eliminations|(123.6)|14.7| |Group segment revenue|4,418.5|3,186.2| |||| |Adjustment for over – recovery:||| |Flexible Generation|50.1|27.9| |Customer Solutions|99.7|7.6| |Total adjustment for over – recovery|149.8|35.5| |||| |Total revenue|4,568.3|3,221.7| ###### The adjustment for over - recovery represents the amount by which the regulated businesses over - recovered against their regulated entitlement. ----- #### (b) Operating Profit |Col1|2023 €m|2022 €m| |---|---|---| |Segment Pro-Forma EBITDA||| |Renewables|224.5|211.5| |Flexible Generation|204.7|104.0| |Customer Solutions|(162.1)|(115.4)| |Group Pro-Forma EBITDA|267.1|200.1| |||| |Adjustment for over - recovery|149.8|35.5| |Group EBITDA|416.9|235.6| |||| |Depreciation / amortisation||| |Renewables|(30.5)|(30.0)| |Flexible Generation|(15.7)|(10.6)| |Customer Solutions|(16.3)|(17.0)| |Group depreciation and amortisation|(62.5)|(57.6)| |||| |Operating profit pre-exceptional items and certain remeasurements||| |Renewables|194.0|181.5| |Flexible Generation|189.0|93.4| |Customer Solutions|(178.4)|(132.4)| |Group Pro-Forma operating profit|204.6|142.5| |||| |Adjustment for over - recovery|149.8|35.5| |Operating profit pre-exceptional items and certain remeasurements|354.4|178.0| |||| |Exceptional items and certain remeasurements||| |Renewables|(4.3)|(27.9)| |Flexible Generation|47.0|30.0| |Customer Solutions|(35.4)|5.2| |Group operating profit post exceptional items and certain remeasurements|361.7|185.3| |||| |Finance cost|(41.5)|(50.9)| |Finance income|4.3|0.1| ||(37.2)|(50.8)| |Profit on ordinary activities before tax|324.5|134.5| ----- #### (c) Capital expenditure",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

Included in thermal generation assets are amounts in respect of assets under construction amounting to €54.1 m (2022 - €21.6m). The renewable generation assets of the specific project finance companies are given as security against the project finance facilities. (ii) An impairment charge was recognised in 2018 of €140.3m in respect of the Huntstown Plants (Flexible Generation) following the introduction of the I-SEM market and resultant uncertainty on the plants’ future. An impairment review has been carried out to determine if a further impairment exists or a further reversal of the 2018 impairment has occurred. The review compared the net present value (NPV) of future cashflows (VIU) using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.3% (2022 – 8.6%) to their Net Book Value (NBV) at 31 March 2023. The VIU was calculated at €147m which resulted in a partial impairment reversal of €47m reflecting the plants success in obtaining capacity contracts to September 2027. Forecasted cashflows for the plants contained within the Group’s five-year business plan are based on forecasted running profiles, (derived from forecasted market demand and generation capacity), forward fuel prices, together with projected operating costs and capital expenditure. The value in use resultant impairment reversal is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumptions. The resultant fair value determined is considered to fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as set out in IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement. An impairment review carried out in the prior year in respect of the Hunstown Plants (Flexible Generation) resulted in a partial reversal of impairment of €30m of the 2018 impairment reflecting the plants success in obtaining capacity contracts to September 2026 and following the replacement of the Huntstown 2 transformer during the prior year. In the Third Quarter of the current year, the business of Huntstown Bioenergy met the criteria for classification as held for sale and an impairment charge of €9.4m was recognised in respect of the Huntstown Bioenergy plant during the year (2022 - €23.9m) to reduce the carrying amount of the assets in the disposal group to their fair value less costs to sell.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ###### The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill has been allocated to the following CGUs: |Col1|2023 €m|2022 €m| |---|---|---| |Current|101.6|79.6| |Non-current|648.3|681.6| ||749.9|761.2| |CGU|2023 €m|2022 €m| |---|---|---| |Customer Solutions - Energia|382.7|399.2| |Customer Solutions - Power NI|143.2|149.4| |Total goodwill|525.9|548.6| ###### The recoverable amount of the Energia and Power NI Customer Solutions CGUs has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using five year cash flow projections together with a long-term growth rate of 2% applied thereafter. The Group’s projections are based on past experience and reflect the Group’s forward view of market prices, risks and its strategic objectives. The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying amount of the CGU to determine whether the CGU is impaired. ###### Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations Discount rates The pre-tax discount rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use for the CGUs was between 8.1% and 8.5% (2022 – 8.3% and 8.8%) reflecting management’s estimate of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) post-tax rate required to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals. These rates reflect market projections of the risk-free rate in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, equity risk premiums and the cost of debt appropriate to the industry. ----- ###### Energia Customer Solutions CGU The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections of this CGU are based are as follows: (i) Retail supply revenues for electricity and gas are based on the expected market share derived from the market share at the time of the approval of the business model adjusted for forecasted growth. Growth in business customer numbers is modest and growth in respect of residential supply is modest with cash flows associated with increased customer service and customer acquisition incorporated accordingly; and (ii) Retail supply margins are based on historic and projected gross margin percentages. Power NI Customer Solutions CGU The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections of this CGU are based are as follows: (i) Regulated revenues and margins are underpinned by the regulatory price control  in place to 31 March 2025; ###### (ii) Customer attrition is assumed, however the nature of the price control with regulated entitlement 70% fixed and 30% variable reduces the impact of customer losses; and (iii) Unregulated retail supply margins for business customers are based on historic and projected gross margin percentages. Outcome of Tests The recoverable amount of both the Energia and Power NI Customer Solutions CGUs, which include Customer Solutions retail supply and renewable PPA operations of those respective statutory entities, exceeded the respective carrying values at the time of the impairment test. While cash flows are subject to inherent uncertainty, reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions applied in assessing the value-in-use would not cause a change to the conclusion reached. #### 15. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS ###### Disposals in 2023 On 23 February 2023 the Group disposed of its 100% interest in Huntstown Bioenergy Limited, a company involved in the construction of a bioenergy anaerobic digestion plant at Huntstown, County Dublin. The assets of Huntstown Bioenergy Limited were classified as held for sale during the third quarter of Financial Year 2023 which resulted in the Group recognising an impairment of €9.4m to property, plant and equipment so as ###### to reduce the carrying amount of the assets in the disposal group to their fair value less costs to sell. The company was subsequently disposed of on 23 February 2023. On 1 July 2022, the Group disposed of its 100% interest in Energia Group Insurance Limited, an insurance business incorporated in Isle of Man, which resulted in a loss on disposal of €0.5m and cash proceeds of €0.9m. ----- ###### Acquisitions in 2022 On 27 May 2021, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Drumlins Park Limited (Drumlin), a 49MW wind farm development project in County Monaghan. On 11 March 2022, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Gaofar Limited (Ballylongford), a 25MW wind farm development project in County Kerry. ###### Assets acquired and liabilities assumed The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the wind farms acquired was: |Col1|Drumlins Park Limited €m|Gaofar Limited €m|Fair value recognised on acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2022 €m| |---|---|---|---| |Assets|||| |Fixed assets – development costs|0.6|0.9|1.5| |External interest receivable|0.6|0.9|1.5| |Liabilities|||| |Other payables|(0.3)|(0.3)|(0.6)| |Accruals|-|(0.4)|(0.4)| |Contingent liability|-|(0.2)|(0.2)| |Shareholder loan|(1.7)|-|(1.7)| |Total identifiable net liabilities at fair value|(2.0)|(0.9)|(2.9)| ||(2.0)||| |Intangible assets (development assets) arising on acquisition|26.5|0.7|27.2| |Purchase consideration transferred|25.1|0.7|25.8| ||(2.0)||| |Purchase consideration is made up of:|||| |Cash|25.1|0.7|25.8| ||25.1|0.7|25.8| ||(2.0)||| |Analysis of cash flows on acquisition:|||| |Cash|25.1|0.7|25.8| |Discharge of liabilities|2.0|0.3|2.3| |Net cash flows on acquisition|27.1|1.0|28.1| ----- #### 16.

An increase in the UK corporation rate from 19% to 25% (effective from 1 April 2023) was announced in the 2021 Budget. This planned increase in the UK corporation tax rate has been enacted in law before the balance sheet date and is therefore reflected in the deferred tax balances at 31 March 2022 where it is expected that the deferred tax will be realised at the 25% tax rate. The main UK corporation tax rate will remain at 19% until 1 April 2023, this rate has been applied to deferred tax balances at 31 March 2022 that are expected to be realised before 1 April 2023. ###### RoI deferred tax has been calculated at 12.5% as at 31 March 2022. A deferred tax asset of €27.2m (2021 - €23.6m) has not been recognised in relation to €108.1m (2021 - €123.5m) of tax losses carried forward, and €1.8m (2021 - €5.1m) on other, due to uncertainty regarding the quantum of future taxable profits in the companies concerned. ----- #### 12.

Included in thermal generation assets are amounts in respect of assets under construction amounting to €21.6m (2021 - €3.3m). The renewable generation assets of the specific project finance companies are given as security against the project finance facilities. (ii) An impairment charge was recognised in 2018 of €140.3m in respect of the Huntstown Plants (Flexible Generation) following the introduction of the I-SEM market and resultant uncertainty on the plants’ future. An impairment review has been carried out to determine if a further impairment exists or a reversal of the 2018 impairment has occurred. The review compared the net present value (NPV) of future cashflows (VIU) using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.6% (2021 – 8.1%) to their Net Book Value (NBV) at 31 March 2022. The VIU was calculated at €93.7m which resulted in a partial impairment reversal of €30m reflecting the plants success in obtaining capacity contracts to September 2026 and following the replacement of the Huntstown 2 transformer during the year. Forecasted cashflows for the plants contained within the Group’s fiveyear business plan are based on forecasted running profiles, forward fuel prices, projected operating costs and capital expenditure. The resultant fair value determined is considered to fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as set out in IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement. An impairment review has been carried out in respect of the Huntstown Bioenergy plant (Renewables) as the plant has experienced significant delays and has not been able to demonstrate that it can meet the technical and performance parameters required. Various technical solutions are being assessed to alleviate the issues and have been factored into the forecasted cashflows for the plant. The review compared the NPV of future cashflows using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.6% (2021 – 8.1%) to its NBV at 31 March 2022 which resulted in an impairment charge of €23.9m based on a VIU of €32.0m. The resultant fair value determined is considered to fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as set out in IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement. #### 13.

As a result of this change the main UK corporation tax rate remained at 19% from 1 April 2020. The UK deferred tax has been calculated at 19% as at 31 March 2021 reflecting HMRC enactment, on 17 March 2020, of this non change in the UK corporation tax rate. RoI deferred tax has been calculated at 12.5% as at 31 March 2021. ###### An increase in the UK corporation rate from 19% to 25% (effective from April 2023) was announced in the 2021 Budget. This rate has not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and is not reflected in the deferred tax balances. The net balance sheet impact of applying the 25% rate to the closing deferred tax balances would be €0.2m (being a €6.3m increase in the deferred tax asset offset by a €6.1m increase the deferred tax liability). A deferred tax asset of €23.6m (2020 - €28.5m) has not been recognised in relation to €123.5m (2020 - €127.3m) of tax losses carried forward, €nil (2020 - €20.7m) of interest on which no tax relief has yet been claimed and €3.7m (2020 - €7.8m) on other, due to uncertainty regarding the quantum of future taxable profits in the companies concerned. ----- #### 12.

An increase in the Group’s allowance for expected credit losses has been applied reflecting the geopolitical risks which have impacted world commodity prices, given rise to tariff increases, higher inflation and potential economic downturn. The resulting impact that these factors could have on the Group trade receivables is described below. Commercial customers A detailed assessment of the Group’s commercial customer base in both jurisdictions of NI and RoI has been carried out. In the first instance those customers with delayed payment terms have been provided for specifically in line with standard practice. Following this, initial assessment risk ratings of high, medium and low are assigned to customer balances reflecting their specific sectoral risk. Sectors which have been considered high risk include, non-essential retail, hospitality, leisure and construction. A matrix has been applied consistent with last year in relation to medium and low risk customer sectors. Using this analysis in conjunction with a risk weighting applied to each risk level combined with higher billing as a result of increased prices associated with higher commodity prices, provisions have increased by €0.9m above 2022 levels. ###### Residential customers As with commercial customers in the first instance those customers outside specific payment terms and certain collection characteristics are provided for specifically in line with standard practice.  Further to this an analysis of the Group’s residential customers receivables has been carried out, with customer insight profiling being used to establish the mix of customer groups that are represented in the Group’s portfolio of residential customers. Using this analysis in conjunction with a risk weighting applied to each risk level, high, medium and low reflecting the specific probability of non-payment, combined with the impact of tariff increases during the year (reflecting sustained higher commodity prices) have resulted in an increase in provisions by €1.5m above 2022 levels applied on both billed and unbilled (consumption of up to three months in NI which have not yet billed in line with normal billing cycles) receivable amounts.

The defined benefit section is closed to new entrants. There is also a money purchase arrangement for employees in the RoI known as ‘Choices’. Most employees of the Group are members of the EGNIPS Options or Choices. The assets of the Focus section are held under trust and invested by the trustees on the advice of professional investment managers. The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and the Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date. There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make further contributions to recover any deficit. The Trustees regularly review the investment strategy of EGNIPS and the target mix of investments was between 30% on-risk and 70% off-risk at 31 March 2023. The last actuarial valuation of the EGNIPS was as at 31 March 2021 and under the terms of the recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, the Group will make good the €7.6m funding shortfall through annual deficit repair contributions of €1.5m for five years to 31 March 2026 and €0.5m in the year ending 31 March 2027.

A summary of the fair values of the financial  assets and liabilities of the Group together  with their carrying values shown in the balance sheet and their fair value hierarchy is as follows: |Col1|2022 Carrying value €m|2022 Fair value €m|2021 Carrying value €m|2021 Fair value €m| |---|---|---|---|---| |Level 1||||| |Non-current liabilities||||| |Senior secured notes (2024 and 2025)|(611.5)|(589.6)|(607.5)|(622.7)| |Level 2||||| |Non-current liabilities||||| |Project financed bank facilities (NI)|(178.2)|(178.2)|(188.0)|(188.0)| |Project financed bank facilities (RoI)|(130.7)|(130.7)|(141.9)|(141.9)| |Level 3||||| |Non-current liabilities||||| |Financial liabilities (contingent consideration)|(10.4)|(10.4)|(15.8)|(15.8)| |Financial liabilities (contingent liability)|(0.2)|(0.2)|-|-| |Financial liabilities (lease liability)|(31.9)|(31.9)|(32.3)|(32.3)| |Current liabilities||||| |Senior revolving credit facility|(59.3)|(59.3)|-|-| |Financial liabilities (contingent consideration)|(6.5)|(6.5)|(0.9)|(0.9)| |Financial liabilities (lease liability)|(1.6)|(1.6)|(1.6)|(1.6)| ----- ###### The carrying value of cash, trade receivables, trade payables and other current assets and liabilities is equivalent to fair value due to the short-term maturities of these items. Contingent consideration and contingent liability is estimated as the present value of future cash flows disclosed at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. Derivatives are measured at fair value and are considered to fall within the level 1 fair value hierarchy.  There have been no transfers between the levels within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Group’s project financed bank facilities (RoI), project financed bank facilities (NI) and Senior revolving credit facility are determined by using discounted cash flows based on the Group’s borrowing rate. The fair value of the Group’s Senior secured notes are based on the quoted market price. The fair value of interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange cross currency swaps and commodity contracts has been valued by calculating the present value  of future cash flows, estimated using forward rates from third party market price quotations. ###### The fair value of the Group’s project financed  bank facilities (RoI) and project financed bank facilities (NI) are a close approximation to their carrying value given that they bear interest at floating rates based on SONIA/Euribor. The fair value of contingent consideration is considered to fall within the level 3 fair value hierarchy and is measured using the present value of the maximum amount payable with the minimum amount payable being €nil. Payment  is contingent on various project milestones  being met, primarily the construction and commissioning of the plant. The carrying value  of €16.9m is estimated to approximate to its fair value determined by using discounted cash flows based on the Company’s borrowing rate. Reasonably possible changes in assumptions would not result in a material change to the value. ----- ###### Financial risk management objectives and policies A summary of the Group’s financial management objectives and policies is set out in the financial control section of the Risk Management and Principal Risks and Uncertainties report. ###### The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s trade and other payables, financial liabilities and derivatives based on contractual undiscounted payments: |Col1|Within one year €m|1 to 5 years €m|>5 years €m|Total €m|Carrying Value Total €m| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Year ended 31 March 2022|||||| |Trade and other payables (excluding tax and social security)|(714.4)|-|-|(714.4)|(714.4)| |Financial liabilities (excluding leases)|(132.7)|(819.4)|(233.0)|(1,185.1)|(1,023.6)| |Financial liabilities - leases|(3.3)|(12.1)|(38.1)|(53.5)|(33.5)| |Derivatives at fair value through other comprehensive income|(130.0)|(7.6)|(0.8)|(138.4)|(138.5)| |Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss|(9.9)|(1.1)|-|(11.0)|(10.9)| ||(990.3)|(840.2)|(271.9)|(2,102.4)|(1,920.9)| ||||||| |Year ended 31 March 2021|||||| |Trade and other payables (excluding tax and social security)|(382.4)|-|-|(382.4)|(382.4)| |Financial liabilities (excluding leases)|(59.3)|(846.6)|(269.3)|(1,175.2)|(979.4)| |Financial liabilities - leases|(3.1)|(11.4)|(36.6)|(51.1)|(33.9)| |Derivatives at fair value through other comprehensive income|(16.3)|(11.9)|(3.3)|(31.5)|(31.3)| |Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss|(1.7)|(0.4)|-|(2.1)|(2.1)| ||(462.8)|(870.3)|(309.2)|(1,642.3)|(1,429.1)| ###### The disclosed financial derivative instruments in the above table are the gross undiscounted cash flows.

Contingent consideration and contingent liability is estimated as the present value of future cash flows disclosed at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. Derivatives are measured at fair value and are considered to fall within the level 1 fair value hierarchy. There have been no transfers between the levels within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Group’s project financed bank facilities (RoI), project financed bank facilities (NI) and Senior revolving credit facility are determined by using discounted cash flows based on the Group’s borrowing rate. The fair value of the Group’s Senior secured notes are based on the quoted market price. The fair value of interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange cross currency swaps and commodity contracts has been valued by calculating the present value of future cash flows, estimated using forward rates from third party market price quotations. The fair value of the Group’s project financed bank facilities (RoI) and project financed bank facilities (NI) are a close approximation to their carrying value given that they bear interest at floating rates based on Sonia/Euribor. ###### The fair value of contingent consideration is considered to fall within the level 3 fair value hierarchy and is measured using the present value of the maximum amount payable with the minimum amount payable being €nil. Payment is contingent on various project milestones being met, primarily the construction and commissioning of the plant. The carrying value of €12.7m is estimated to approximate to its fair value determined by using discounted cash flows based on the Company’s borrowing rate. Reasonably possible changes in assumptions would not result in a material change to the value. The cumulative current and non-current contingent consideration has decreased by €4.2m to €12.7m at 31 March 2023. The decrease year on year relates to a fair value adjustment due to changes in assumptions related to the contingent consideration for renewable generation development projects. ----- ###### Financial risk management objectives and policies A summary of the Group’s financial management objectives and policies is set out in the financial control section of the Risk Management and Principal Risks and Uncertainties report. ###### The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s trade and other payables, financial liabilities and derivatives based on contractual undiscounted payments: |Col1|Within one year €m|1 to 5 years €m|>5 years €m|Total €m|Carrying Value Total €m| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Year ended 31 March 2023|||||| |Trade and other payables (excluding tax and social security)|(673.3)|-|-|(673.3)|(673.3)| |Financial liabilities (excluding leases)|(157.5)|(791.4)|(189.2)|(1,138.1)|(974.9)| |Financial liabilities - leases|(3.3)|(12.8)|(37.1)|(53.2)|(38.0)| |Derivatives at fair value through other comprehensive income|(157.1)|16.8|-|(140.3)|(140.3)| |Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss|(11.8)|(18.6)|-|(30.4)|(30.4)| ||(1,003.0)|(806.0)|(226.3)|(2,035.3)|(1,856.9)| ||||||| |Year ended 31 March 2022|||||| |Trade and other payables (excluding tax and social security)|(714.4)|-|-|(714.4)|(714.4)| |Financial liabilities (excluding leases)|(132.7)|(819.4)|(233.0)|(1,185.1)|(1,023.6)| |Financial liabilities - leases|(3.3)|(12.1)|(38.1)|(53.5)|(33.5)| |Derivatives at fair value through other comprehensive income|(130.0)|(7.6)|(0.8)|(138.4)|(138.5)| |Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss|(9.9)|(1.1)|-|(11.0)|(10.9)| ||(990.3)|(840.2)|(271.9)|(2,102.4)|(1,920.9)| ###### The disclosed financial derivative instruments in the above table are the gross undiscounted cash flows.

The Group is exposed to future cash outflows that have not been reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities, namely in relation to variable lease payments and extension options. The Group has several lease contracts that are subject to an annual variable lease charge which is calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. Availability payments to generators The Group has also entered into generating contracts with generating companies in NI to make payments for the availability of generating capacity as well as for the purchase of electricity generated.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ###### (i) Capital commitments At 31 March 2023 the Group had contracted future capital expenditure in respect of tangible fixed assets of €39.9m (2022 - €15.0m) and intangible fixed assets of €2.5m (2022 - €3.6m). (ii) Contingent liabilities Protected persons The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of obligations under the Electricity (Protected Persons) Pensions Regulations (NI) 1992 to protect the pension rights in respect of certain of its employees who were employees of NI Electricity plc at privatisation. Those Group employees who remain protected by the regulations have their pension rights provided through the Group’s occupational pension scheme. Generating contracts Under the terms of the PPB generating contracts, where modifications to generating equipment are necessary as a result of a change in law and a generator is unable to procure the necessary ###### financing, PPB must either provide such finance or pay the costs incurred by the generator in carrying out such modifications. The costs incurred by PPB in meeting these obligations are recoverable under the applicable provisions of the Power NI Energy licence but would require to be financed by PPB until such recovery is achieved. The Group does not anticipate any liability for modifications which require financing, and no provision has been made. Liability and damage claims In the normal course of business the Group has contingent liabilities arising from claims made by third parties and employees. Provision for a liability is made (as disclosed in note 24) when the Director believes that it is probable that an outflow of funds will be required to settle the obligation where it arises from an event prior to the year end. The Group does not anticipate that any material liabilities will arise other than those recognised in the accounts. #### 31.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS ###### Management Investment Plan (MIP) Under the MIP, growth shares of the parent are granted to certain senior executives of the Group. The exercise price of the share options is equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The growth shares vest over time provided the senior executives continue to be employed by the Group at the vesting date. The fair value of growth shares granted is estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the ###### terms and conditions on which the share options were granted. It takes into account historical and expected dividends, and the share price volatility of the Group relative to that of comparable companies so as to predict the share performance.

The Group is exposed to future cash outflows that have not been reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities, namely in relation to variable  lease payments and extension options. The Group has several lease contracts that are subject to an annual variable lease charge which is calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. Availability payments to generators The Group has also entered into generating contracts with generating companies in NI to make payments for the availability of generating capacity as well as for the purchase of electricity generated.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ###### (i) Capital commitments At 31 March 2022 the Group had contracted future capital expenditure in respect of tangible fixed assets of €15.0m (2021 - €6.2m) and intangible fixed assets of €3.6m (2021 - €nil). (ii) Contingent liabilities Protected persons The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of obligations under the Electricity (Protected Persons) Pensions Regulations (NI) 1992 to  protect the pension rights in respect of certain of  its employees who were employees of NI Electricity plc at privatisation. Those Group employees who remain protected by the regulations have their pension rights provided through the Group’s occupational pension scheme. Generating contracts Under the terms of the PPB generating contracts, where modifications to generating equipment are necessary as a result of a change in law and a generator is unable to procure the necessary ###### financing, PPB must either provide such finance or pay the costs incurred by the generator in carrying out such modifications. The costs incurred by PPB in meeting these obligations are recoverable under the applicable provisions of the Power NI Energy licence, but would require to be financed by PPB until such recovery is achieved. The Group does not anticipate any liability for modifications which require financing and no provision has been made. Liability and damage claims In the normal course of business the Group has contingent liabilities arising from claims made by third parties and employees. Provision for a liability is made (as disclosed in note 24) when the Director believes that it is probable that an outflow of funds will be required to settle the obligation where it arises from an event prior to the year end. The Group does not anticipate that any material liabilities will arise other than those recognised in the accounts. #### 31. DISTRIBUTIONS MADE AND PROPOSED ###### Dividends of €40.0m, at €9,950.25 per share, were declared during the year ended 31 March 2022 and were paid on 5 November 2021. ###### Dividends are paid out of profits or from the Company’s share premium or capital contribution reserve provided a ‘Solvency Test’ is passed. ----- #### 32. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS ###### Management Investment Plan (MIP) Under the MIP, growth shares of the parent are granted to certain senior executives of the Group. The exercise price of the share options is equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The growth shares vest over time provided the senior executives continue to be employed by the Group at the vesting date. The fair value of growth shares granted is estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the ###### terms and conditions on which the share options were granted.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. In our opinion the financial statements: • give a true and fair view of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2022 and of its profit for the year then ended; and • have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. #### Basis for opinion ###### We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. #### Conclusions relating to going concern ###### In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. ----- ###### Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Director with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. #### Other information ###### The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Director is responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. #### Responsibilities of the Director ###### As explained more fully in the Director’s responsibilities statement set out on page 112,  the Director is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Director determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Director is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Director either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. ----- #### Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements ###### Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. ###### • We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and the relevant direct and indirect tax compliance regulation in the United Kingdom, RoI and Cayman Islands. In addition, the Group has to comply with laws and regulations relating to its operations, including health and safety, employees, data protection, anti-bribery and corruption and Electricity regulations in respect of the Group generation and supply activities. • We understood how Energia Group Limited is complying with those frameworks by making enquires of management, internal audit and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated our enquires through our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence. • We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s consolidated financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by utilising internal and external information to perform a fraud risk assessment. We considered the risk of fraud through management override and, in response, we incorporated testing manual journals and designed procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. ----- ###### • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on journal meeting our defined risk criteria based on our understanding of the business, enquires of legal counsel, group and component team management and internal audit. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https:// www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report. #### Use of our report ###### This report is made solely to the company’s directors, as a body, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 10 March 2021. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s directors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s directors as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

CORPORATE INFORMATION ###### The consolidated financial statements of Energia Group Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) for the year ended 31 March 2022 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Director on 1 June 2022. Energia Group Limited (the Company or the parent) is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the Cayman Islands. The registered office is located at PO Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. The Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out earlier in the Report on pages 8-9. #### 2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION ###### The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) as they apply to the financial statements of the Group  for the year ended 31 March 2022. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, contingent consideration arising on business combinations and the assets of the Group’s pension schemes that have been measured at fair value and the liabilities of the Group’s pension schemes that are measured using the projected unit credit valuation method. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros with all  values rounded to the nearest million (€m) except where otherwise indicated. Going Concern The Group’s business activities, together with the principal risks and uncertainties likely to affect its future performance are described in the Strategic and Director’s Report. ###### In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting, a detailed analysis of forecast future cashflows has been prepared by management. The forecasts were based on the key assumptions of fuel prices (applying forward curves for commodities) and market demand (applying growth factors in line with publicly available forecasts and internal assessment). Sensitivity analysis was undertaken in relation to the key assumptions to reflect the impact of higher commodity prices and reduced demand together with potential delays in customers paying their bills. In all scenarios tested the Group was shown to have sufficient financial headroom and was able to operate within the minimum EBITDA covenant contained within its Senior revolving credit facility. Having considered the matters above, the Director has a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of 12 months from the signing of the financial statements and, therefore, continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. #### 2.2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION ###### The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2022. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if  and only if the Group has: • power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); ----- ###### • exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and • the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired  or disposed of during the year are included in  the statement of comprehensive income from  the date the Group gains control until the date  the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full  on consolidation. #### 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) New and amended standards  and interpretations ###### Certain standards and amendments apply for the first time in this set of financial statements, but do not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have  been issued but are not yet effective. ###### Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 The amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate (IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate (RFR). The amendments include the following practical expedients: • A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or changes to cash flows that are directly required by the reform, to be treated as changes to a floating interest rate, equivalent to a movement in a market rate  of interest • Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to hedge designations and hedge documentation without the hedging relationship being discontinued • Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement when a RFR instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component These amendments had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group intends to use the practical expedients in future periods if they become applicable. #### (b) Business combinations and goodwill ###### Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred and measured at acquisition date fair value, and (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. ----- ###### When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at  the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by  the acquiree. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement in accordance with IFRS 9. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IFRS 9,  it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non- controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured  at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. ###### If a subsidiary is subsequently sold any goodwill arising on acquisition which has not been impaired is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale. #### (c) Fair value measurement ###### The Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at each balance sheet  date at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption  that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: • In the principal market for the asset or liability; or • In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. ----- ###### The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: • level 1 - quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •  level 2 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable; or •  level 3 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re- assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes  of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset  or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. #### (d) Revenue from contracts with customers ###### Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services provided in the normal course of business, exclusive of value added tax and other sales related taxes. The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised. Renewable generation The key revenue streams derived from the Renewable generation businesses include the generation of electricity through wholly owned wind assets and third party contracted PPAs across the Island of Ireland together with the sale of ROCs generated from the assets in NI. Revenue in relation to electricity generation is recognised over time and is only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue generated from the I-SEM is settled both weekly and monthly in line with market settlement timelines, while revenue generated from ROCs are recognised at a point in time and settled in line with contractual settlement terms. Flexible generation Two key revenue streams are received by the Flexible Generation businesses Huntstown and PPB. Capacity revenue is recognised based upon the capacity (MW) provided to the I-SEM. Energy revenue is recognised based upon electricity units generated during the period at market price, including an allowance for any anticipated resettlement within the I-SEM. Units are based on energy volumes recorded by SEMO and these units are reconciled to the units recorded on the ----- ###### plant systems to ensure accuracy. Revenue in relation to electricity generation is recognised over time and is only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue generated from the I-SEM is settled both weekly and monthly in line with market settlement timelines. Customer solutions Revenue is recognised on the basis of  electricity and gas supplied during the period. This includes an assessment of electricity and gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the balance sheet date, estimated using historical consumption patterns. Revenue for electricity and gas is recognised over time and only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue recognised includes variable consideration in respect of estimated market resettlement. Electricity and gas revenues are invoiced on a monthly, bi-monthly and quarterly basis with standard credit terms  of 14 days for residential customers. Credit terms for business customers vary by contract. Contract balances Contract assets (accrued income) A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group performs its obligation by transferring goods or services to a customer and  an invoice has not yet been raised, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration. Trade receivables A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to financial assets accounting policies below. ###### Contract liabilities (payments on account) A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group  has transferred goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is received. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs its performance obligation. #### (e) Taxation ###### The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity. Tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years as well  as items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the  balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable ----- ###### that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences where they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability  is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by  the balance sheet date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. ###### Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised in  profit or loss. #### (f) Property, plant and equipment ###### Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if  the recognition criteria for a provision are met. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line  basis so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: ----- ###### • Thermal generation assets 12 to 30 years • Renewable generation assets 20 years • Fixtures and equipment 5 to 25 years • Vehicles and mobile plant 3 to 5 years #### (g) Intangible assets ###### Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.  The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement as the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets. ###### Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite  life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite  is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition  of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. Emissions allowances, renewable and energy efficiency obligations The Group recognises purchased CO2 emissions allowances, ROCs and energy efficiency credits (EECs) initially at cost (purchase price) within intangible assets and subsequently written down to their recoverable amount at the balance sheet date should this be less than the purchase price. Self-generated ROCs are initially recorded at fair value within intangible assets with a corresponding credit to energy costs in the income statement, and subsequently written down to their recoverable amount at the balance sheet date should this be less than the fair value on initial recognition. No amortisation is recorded during the period as the intangible asset is surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the consumption of economic benefit. Emission allowances, energy efficiency obligations and ROCs will  be realised within twelve months. The Group recognises liabilities in respect of its obligations to deliver emissions allowances to the extent that the allowances to be delivered exceed ----- ###### the level of allocation under the EU emissions trading scheme. Any liabilities recognised are measured based on the current estimates of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the obligation. A liability for the renewables obligation and the climate change levy is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers. A liability for the energy efficiency obligation under the EEOS is recognised if energy saving minimum targets are not achieved by the end of the compliance period. Any such liability is recognised on the compliance date (31 December) and is calculated by reference to the relevant  penalty rates for volumes not achieved. Computer software The cost of acquiring computer software is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the Director’s estimate of its useful economic life which is between three and five years. The carrying value of computer software is reviewed for impairment where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Development assets Development assets arising from business combinations relate to value arising from the development of renewable projects which the Group believes will generate future economic benefits. Development assets are amortised from the date of commissioning of the renewable asset over its useful economic  life which is twenty years. At a point the project is no longer expected  to reach construction the carrying amount  of the project is impaired. ###### Customer acquisition costs The incremental costs of obtaining a  customer contract within the Customer  Solutions businesses are capitalised and amortised on a basis that reflects the transfer  of goods or services to the customer. #### (h) Leases ###### Right-of-use assets The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Leases of land and buildings generally have lease terms between 5 and 25 years, while motor vehicles and other equipment generally have lease terms between 3 and 5 years. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. ----- ###### The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period on which the event  or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in- substance fixed lease payments or a change in  the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases and leases of  low-value assets The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term  leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. #### (i) Financial instruments -  initial recognition and  subsequent measurement ###### A financial instrument is any contract that  gives rise to a financial asset of one entity  and a financial liability or equity instrument  of another entity. Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and fair value through the profit or loss. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets’ contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price under IFRS 15. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘Solely Payments of Principal and Interest’ (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. The Group’s business model for management of financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. ----- ###### The business model determines whether the cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified in four categories: • Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments); • Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments); • Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); and • Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets at amortised cost  (debt instruments) This category is the most relevant to the Group. The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: • The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and • The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified, or impaired. ###### This category generally applies to trade and  other receivables. Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised and carried at  the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Financial assets at fair value through  profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9. The Group has not designated any financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair value presented as finance costs (negative net changes in fair value) or finance income (positive net changes in fair value) in the income statement. Derecognition A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group’s consolidated balance sheet) when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. Impairment of financial assets The Group recognises an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash  flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original ----- ###### effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposure for which there has not been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12 month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL). For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applied a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognised a loss allowance based on the  lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 120 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicated that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. ###### Interest income For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the EIR method. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. Interest income is included in finance income in the income statement. Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially  at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments. Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through  the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. ----- ###### The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. This category generally applies to interest bearing loans and borrowings. This category also applies to trade and other payables which are not interest bearing and  stated at their nominal amount. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. #### (j) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting ###### Initial recognition and subequent measurement The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps, contracts for differences and forward commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, interest rate risks, electricity price risk and other commodity price risks, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. The purchase contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement as operating costs. Commodity contracts that are entered into and continue to be ###### held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are held at cost. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in other comprehensive income and later reclassified  to profit or loss when the hedge item affects  profit or loss. For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: • fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment; • cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment; or • hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes ----- ###### in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.Hedges that meet the strict criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are accounted for, as described below: Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement in operating costs. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in  fair value of the hedged item. The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments, as well as forward commodity contracts for its exposure to volatility in the commodity prices. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency and commodity contracts is  recognised in operating costs. The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. ###### This is not a reclassification adjustment and  will not be recognised in other comprehensive income for the period. For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flows occur, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above. #### (k) Impairment of non-financial assets ###### The Group assesses at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset  may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount ----- ###### rate that reflects current market assessments  of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods,  a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been ###### recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. The following assets have specific characteristics for impairment testing: Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. #### (l) Cash and cash equivalents ###### Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits with a maturity of less than three months. #### (m) Provisions ###### Decommissioning liability Provision is made for estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the estimated useful lives of generation assets on a discounted basis based on price levels and technology at the balance sheet date. Changes in these estimates and changes to the discount rates are added to or deducted from the capitalised cost of the asset to which they relate. Capitalised decommissioning costs are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of  the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. ----- #### (n) Exceptional items and certain remeasurements ###### As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial statements, the Group has disclosed additional information in respect of exceptional items on the face of the income statement to aid understanding of the Group’s financial performance. An item is treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by nature and scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. “Certain remeasurements” are remeasurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships, and which are accounted for as held for trading in accordance with the Group’s policy for such financial instruments. This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group’s own use requirements. Certain remeasurements arising from IFRS 9 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. #### (o) Pensions and other post- employment benefits ###### The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements. The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of liabilities represents the present value of the obligations offset by the fair value of assets. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method. Pension remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding net interest), and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the balance ###### sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Pension remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs  are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of: • the date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and • the date that the Group recognises restructuring-related costs. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under operating costs in the consolidated income statement: • service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and • net interest expense or income. Pension costs in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable. However, paragraph 64 of IAS 19 Employee Benefits (2011) limits the measurement of the defined benefit asset to the ‘present value of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.’ IFRIC 14 addresses the interaction between a minimum funding requirement and the limit placed by paragraph 64 of IAS 19 on the measurement of the defined benefit asset or liability. When determining the limit on a defined benefit asset in accordance with IAS 19.64, ----- ###### under IFRIC 14 entities are required to measure any economic benefits available to them in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions at the maximum amount that is consistent with the terms and conditions of the plan and any statutory requirements in the jurisdiction of the plan. The entity’s intentions on how to use a surplus (for instance, whether the entity intends to improve benefits rather than reduce contributions or get a refund)  must be disregarded. Such economic benefits are regarded as available to an entity if the entity has an unconditional right to realise them at some point during the life of the plan or when the plan is settled, even if they are not realisable immediately at the balance sheet date. Such an unconditional right would not exist when the availability of the refund or the reduction in future contribution would be contingent upon factors beyond the entity’s control (for example, approval by third parties such as plan trustees). To the extent the right  is contingent, no asset would be recognised. #### (p) Inventories ###### Inventories are valued at the lower of average purchase price and net realisable value. #### (q) Borrowing costs ###### Borrowing costs directly attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. #### (r) Foreign currency translation ###### The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro. Energia Group Limited’s functional currency is sterling. For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and ###### items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are  initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are  translated at the functional currency spot  rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items  are also recorded in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in  terms of historical cost in a foreign currency  are translated using the exchange rates at  the dates of the initial transactions. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Euro at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their income statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the ----- ###### transactions. The exchange differences arising  on translation for consolidation are recognised  in other comprehensive income. #### (s) Share-based payments ###### Employees (senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity- settled transactions). Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 32. That cost is recognised in employee benefits expense (note 9), together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the consolidated income statement for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within ###### the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non- vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and / or performance conditions. No expense is recognised for awards that do  not ultimately vest because non-market performance and / or service conditions have  not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and /  or service conditions are satisfied. When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair value of the unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms of the award are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of modification, is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the  fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss. #### (t) Government grant ###### Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, ----- ###### it is recognised as income in equal amounts  over the expected useful life of the related asset. When the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the asset, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments. #### (u) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions ###### The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and operating costs during the year. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Judgements In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: Exceptional items and certain remeasurements The Group has disclosed additional information in respect of exceptional items on the face of the income statement to aid understanding of the Group’s financial performance. An item is treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by nature and scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. “Certain remeasurements” are remeasurements ###### arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships, and which are accounted for as held for trading in accordance with the Group’s policy for such financial instruments. This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group’s own use requirements. Exceptional items and certain remeasurements have been outlined in note 7. Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. Revenue recognition Revenue on energy sales include an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This will have been estimated by using historical consumption patterns. At the balance sheet date, the estimated consumption by customers will either have been billed or accrued (estimated unbilled revenue). Management apply judgement to the measurement of the quantum and valuation of the estimated consumption, including an estimate in respect of the impact of increased commodity prices as a result of the ongoing ----- ###### geopolitical circumstances, that may impact the Group customers’ ability to pay. At 31 March 2022 the level of unbilled revenue not recognised was €44.7m (2021 - €14.4m). The judgements applied and the assumptions underpinning these judgements are considered to be appropriate. However, for every 1% change in these assumptions the impact upon the amount of revenue recognised would be €1.7m. Revenue recognised in the period has been outlined in note 5. Impairment testing The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that the value of those assets is impaired. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the assets are allocated which includes the estimation of future cash flows and the application of a suitable discount rate. Subsequent changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the assets within the respective CGUs. Impairment testing has been outlined in note 14. Business combinations Business combinations require a fair value exercise to be undertaken to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based to a considerable extent on management’s judgement. The amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of this purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities with any unallocated portion being recorded as goodwill. Business combinations have been outlined in note 15. ###### Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit method.  The key assumptions used in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits are set after consultation with qualified actuaries. While these assumptions are considered to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group. Pensions and other post-employment  benefits have been outlined in note 23. Credit provisions for trade receivables The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and uses a provision matrix. The matrix approach allows application of different rates to different groups of customers with similar characteristics. The provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates. The Group then calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward- looking information. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. The Group has adjusted the ECL matrix for the forecast impact of increased commodity prices as a result of the ongoing geopolitical circumstances impacting the Group customers’ both businesses and residential. Information on the ECLs on the Group’s trade receivables and contract assets together with further detail relating to the adjustments is disclosed in note 18. Provision for I-SEM resettlement The I-SEM market trading arrangements, which comprise a Day Ahead Market, Intra-Day Market and Balancing Market, experienced volatility ----- ###### since the market commenced on 1 October 2018. The market has become more stable, with a number of fixes applied by the Market Operator, however the Group’s energy purchase and supply businesses remain exposed to some energy price resettlement risks. As at 31 March 2022 the Market Operator has resettled these markets up to end November 2021 for M+4 resettlement and end February 2021 for M+13 resettlement in line with the expected market resettlement timetable of 4 months and 13 months after initial settlement. Further market fixes are required to be implemented before the market settlement solution can be considered fully aligned to the market code requirements, with a number of additional resettlements to occur ranging across the full 42-month period since the market commenced. The Group therefore continues to be exposed to potential price resettlements in the balancing market and estimates the level of resettlement that may be applied. These estimates are based on known market anomalies as discussed in industry forums and facts and circumstances known at the Balance Sheet date. Estimations are dependent on the resettlement approach taken by the market operator. There is therefore a significant degree of judgement required in order to estimate the level of resettlement that will be applied. The current year estimate of c.3.5% (2021 – c.6%) of balancing market revenues is considered a reasonable estimate and is supported by actual resettlements seen in the market to date, and reflect the various fixes applied by the market operator during the past 12 months. Further to the balancing market resettlement exposures outlined above, reflecting inaccuracies and errors at inception in the market code, the Group maintains provisions for potential incremental resettlement exposures in respect of fixed cost charges. ###### A quantitative sensitivity analysis in relation to these key assumptions shows that, for every 1% increase or decrease in the percentage used in the resettlement provisions for balancing market exposures would be an increase or decrease to operating profit respectively of €3.0m and for a 5% movement in the provision relevant to fixed costs charges, the impact of this would be an increase or decrease to operating profit respectively of €0.3m. #### (v) Standards issued but not yet effective ###### The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of the issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective. Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current In January 2020, the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify: •  What is meant by a right to defer settlement •  That a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period •  That classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right •  That only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification ----- ###### The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and must be applied retrospectively. The Group is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on current practice. Reference to the Conceptual Framework – Amendments to IFRS 3 In May 2020, the IASB issued Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Reference to the Conceptual Framework. The amendments are intended to replace a reference to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, issued in 1989, with a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued in March 2018 without significantly changing its requirements. The IASB also added an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 to avoid the issue of potential ‘day 2’ gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred separately. At the same time, the IASB decided to clarify existing guidance in IFRS 3 for contingent assets that would not be affected by replacing the reference to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and apply prospectively. The Group is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on current practice. Disclosure of Accounting Policies -  Amendments to IAS 12 On 7 May 2021, the IASB issued Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction – Amendments to IAS 12 (the ###### Amendments). The Board amended the standard to reduce diversity in the way that entities account for deferred tax on transactions and events, such as leases and decommissioning obligations, that lead to the initial recognition of both an asset and a liability. The Amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception under IAS 12 Income Taxes, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Amendments also clarify that where payments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognised in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and interest expense). This judgement is important in determining whether any temporary differences exist on initial recognition of the asset and liability. The Amendments apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with earlier application permitted. The Group  is currently assessing the impact. Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 8 In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8, in which it introduces a definition of ‘accounting estimates’. The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after ----- ###### 1 January 2023 and apply to changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start of that period. Earlier application is permitted as long as this fact is disclosed. The Group is currently assessing the impact. Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 In February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, in which it provides guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments to IAS 1 are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 with earlier application permitted. Since the amendments to the Practice Statement 2 provide non-mandatory guidance on the application of the definition of material to accounting policy information, an effective  date for these amendments is not necessary. The Group is currently assessing the impact  of the amendments to determine the impact they will have on the Group’s accounting  policy disclosures. #### 4. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS ###### For management purposes, the Group is  organised into business units based on  its products and services and has three  reportable segments, as follows: (i) Renewables The Renewables business owns and operates 309MW of wind assets and purchases electricity from 1,282MW  of renewable generation capacity  throughout Ireland. (ii) Flexible Generation Consists of electricity generation from the Group’s two Huntstown CCGT plants together with the administration of the contracted generation capacity from the Ballylumford power station in NI under legacy generating unit agreements which were originally established in 1992 when the NI electricity industry was restructured. (iii) Customer Solutions Consists of the competitive supply of electricity and gas to business and residential customers in the RoI through its brand Energia, together with the supply of electricity to residential and business customers in NI through its brand Power NI. ----- ###### The Group’s Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions with regard to resource allocation and performance assessment.  The measure of profit used by the Board is pro- forma EBITDA which is operating profit before exceptional items and certain remeasurements (arising from certain commodity and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships) and based on regulated entitlement (whereby the adjustment for over / (under) - recovery outlined in the segmental analysis below represents the amount by which the regulated businesses over / (under) - recovered against their regulated entitlement). The Board also monitors revenue on a regulated entitlement basis. ----- #### (a) Revenue by segment",N/A,as_expected,2023,606

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ###### The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill has been allocated to the following CGUs: |Col1|2022 €m|2021 €m| |---|---|---| |Current|79.6|84.9| |Non-current|681.6|654.7| ||761.2|739.6| |CGU|2022 €m|2021 €m| |---|---|---| |Customer Solutions - Energia|399.2|395.4| |Customer Solutions - Power NI|149.4|148.1| |Total goodwill|548.6|543.5| ###### The recoverable amount of the Energia and Power NI Customer Solutions CGUs has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using five year cash flow projections together with a long-term growth rate of 2% applied thereafter. The Group’s projections are based on past experience and reflect the Group’s forward view of market prices, risks and its strategic objectives. The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying amount of the CGU to determine whether the CGU is impaired. ###### Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations Discount rates The pre-tax discount rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use for the CGUs was between 8.3% and 8.8% (2021 – 7.8% and 8.3%) reflecting management’s estimate of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) post-tax rate required to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals. These rates reflect market projections of the risk-free rate in  the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, equity risk premiums and the cost of debt appropriate to the industry. ----- ###### Energia Customer Solutions CGU The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections of this CGU are based are as follows: (i) Retail supply revenues for electricity and gas are based on the expected market share derived from the market share at the time of the approval of the business model adjusted for forecasted growth. Growth in business customer numbers is modest and growth in respect of residential supply is modest with cash flows associated with increased customer service and customer acquisition incorporated accordingly; and (ii) Retail supply margins are based on historic  and projected gross margin percentages. Power NI Customer Solutions CGU The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections of this CGU are based are as follows: (i) Regulated revenues and margins are underpinned by the regulatory price control  in place to 31 March 2023; (ii) Customer attrition is assumed, however the nature of the price control with regulated entitlement 70% fixed and 30% variable reduces the impact of customer losses; and (iii) Unregulated retail supply margins for business customers are based on historic and projected gross margin percentages. ###### Outcome of Tests The recoverable amount of both the Energia and Power NI Customer Solutions CGUs exceeded the respective carrying values at the time of the impairment test. While cash flows are subject to inherent uncertainty, reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions applied in assessing the value-in-use would not cause a change to the conclusion reached. ----- #### 15.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is IFRS as adopted by the European Union. In our opinion the financial statements: • give a true and fair view of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2021 and of its profit for the year then ended; and • have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. #### Basis for opinion ###### We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. #### Conclusions relating to going concern ###### In auditing the consolidated financial statements, we have concluded that the Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is appropriate. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 21 months from when the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue. ----- ###### Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Director with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. #### Other information ###### The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. #### Responsibilities of Directors ###### As explained more fully in the Director’s responsibilities statement set out on page 124, the Director is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the director determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Director is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Director either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. ----- #### Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements ###### Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. ###### • We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and the relevant direct and indirect tax compliance regulation in the United Kingdom, RoI and Cayman Islands. In addition, the Group has to comply with laws and regulations relating to its operations, including health and safety, employees, data protection, anti-bribery and corruption and Electricity regulations in respect of the Group generation and supply activities. • We understood how Energia Group Limited is complying with those frameworks by making enquires of management, internal audit and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated our enquires through our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence. • We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s consolidated financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by utilising internal and external information to perform a fraud risk assessment. We considered the risk of fraud through management override and, in response, we incorporated testing manual journals and designed procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. ----- ###### • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on journal meeting our defined risk criteria based on our understanding of the business, enquires of legal counsel, group and component team management and internal audit. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. #### Use of our report ###### Use of our report This report is made solely to the company’s directors, as a body, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 10 March 2021.

CORPORATE INFORMATION ###### The consolidated financial statements of Energia Group Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) for the year ended 31 March 2021 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Director on 2 June 2021. Energia Group Limited (the Company or the parent) is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the Cayman Islands. The registered office is located at PO Box 309, Ugland House, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. The Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out earlier in the Report on pages 8-9. #### 2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION ###### The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS) as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2021. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, contingent consideration arising on business combinations and the assets of the Group’s pension schemes that have been measured at fair value and the liabilities of the Group’s pension schemes that are measured using the projected unit credit valuation method. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros with all values rounded to the nearest million (€m) except where otherwise indicated. ###### Going Concern The Group’s business activities, together with the principal risks and uncertainties likely to affect its future performance are described in the Strategic and Director’s Report. In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting, a detailed analysis of forecast future cashflows has been prepared by management. The forecasts were based on the key assumptions of fuel prices (applying forward curves for commodities) and market demand (applying growth factors in line with publicly available forecasts and internal assessment). Sensitivity analysis was undertaken in relation to the key assumptions to reflect updated fuel prices and a reduction in demand. The impact on the business of potential future scenarios arising from the impact of COVID-19 was also considered. In all scenarios tested the Group was shown to have sufficient financial headroom and was able to operate within the minimum EBITDA covenant contained within its Senior revolving credit facility. Having considered the matters above, the Director has a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, therefore, continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts. ----- #### 2.2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION ###### The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2021. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: • power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee); • exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and • the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. #### 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (a) New and amended standards and interpretations ###### Certain standards and amendments apply for the first time in this set of financial statements, but do not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. Amendments to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business The amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations clarifies that to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that, together, significantly contribute to the ability to create output. Furthermore, it clarifies that a business can exist without including all of the inputs and processes needed to create outputs. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group but may impact future periods should the Group enter into any business combinations. ----- ###### Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material The amendments provide a new definition of material that states, “information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.” The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. #### (b) Business combinations and goodwill ###### Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred and measured at acquisition date fair value, and (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IFRS 9 ###### Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement in accordance with IFRS 9. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IFRS 9, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non- controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. If a subsidiary is subsequently sold any goodwill arising on acquisition which has not been impaired is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale. ----- #### (c) Investment in associates ###### An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not control or have joint control over those policies. The considerations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries. The Group sold its remaining associate interest in August 2019. The Group’s investment in its associate was accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. The Income Statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s other comprehensive income. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate. ###### The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the Income Statement outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, then recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit of an associate’ in the Income Statement. ----- #### (d) Fair value measurement ###### The Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at each balance sheet date at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: • in the principal market for the asset or liability; or • in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. ###### All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: • level 1 - quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • level 2 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable; or • level 3 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. ----- #### (e) Revenue from contracts with customers ###### Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services provided in the normal course of business, exclusive of value added tax and other sales related taxes. The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised. Renewable generation The key revenue streams derived from the Renewable generation businesses include the generation of electricity through wholly owned wind assets and third party contracted PPAs across the Island of Ireland together with the sale of ROCs generated from the assets in NI. Revenue in relation to electricity generation is recognised over time and is only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue generated from the I-SEM is settled both weekly and monthly in line with market settlement timelines, while revenue generated from ROCs are recognised at a point in time and settled in line with contractual settlement terms. Flexible generation Two key revenue streams are received by the Flexible Generation businesses Huntstown and PPB. Capacity revenue is recognised based upon the capacity (MW) provided to the I-SEM. Energy revenue is recognised based upon electricity units generated during the period at market price, including an allowance for any anticipated resettlement within the I-SEM. Units are based on energy volumes recorded by SEMO and these units are reconciled to the units recorded on the plant systems to ensure accuracy. Revenue in relation to ###### electricity generation is recognised over time and is only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue generated from the I-SEM is settled both weekly and monthly in line with market settlement timelines. Customer solutions Revenue is recognised on the basis of electricity and gas supplied during the period. This includes an assessment of electricity and gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the balance sheet date, estimated using historical consumption patterns. Revenue for electricity and gas is recognised over time and only recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied in line with IFRS 15. Revenue recognised includes variable consideration in respect of estimated market resettlement. Electricity and gas revenues are invoiced on a monthly, bi-monthly and quarterly basis with standard credit terms of 14 days for residential customers. Credit terms for business customers vary by contract. Contract balances Contract assets (accrued income) A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group performs its obligation by transferring goods or services to a customer and an invoice has not yet been raised, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration. Trade receivables A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to financial assets accounting policies below. ----- ###### Contract liabilities (payments on account) A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group has transferred goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is received. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs its performance obligation. #### (f) Taxation ###### The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity. Tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes both items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which ###### deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences where they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss. Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. ----- ###### Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date, are recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances change. The adjustment is either treated as a reduction in goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the measurement period or recognised in profit or loss. #### (g) Dividends payable ###### Dividends are recorded in the year in which shareholder approval is obtained. #### (h) Property, plant and equipment ###### Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the property, plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciates them accordingly. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: ###### • Thermal generation assets - 12 to 30 years • Renewable generation assets - 20 years • Fixtures and equipment - 5 to 25 years • Vehicles and mobile plant - 3 to 5 years. #### (i) Intangible assets ###### Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement as the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets. ----- ###### Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. Emissions allowances, renewable and energy efficiency obligations The Group recognises purchased CO2 emissions allowances, ROCs and energy efficiency credits (EECs) initially at cost (purchase price) within intangible assets and subsequently written down to their recoverable amount at the balance sheet date should this be less than the purchase price. Self-generated ROCs are initially recorded at fair value within intangible assets with a corresponding credit to energy costs in the income statement, and subsequently written down to their recoverable amount at the balance sheet date should this be less than the fair value on initial recognition. No amortisation is recorded during the period as the intangible asset is surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the consumption of economic benefit. Emission allowances, energy efficiency obligations and ROCs will be realised within twelve months. The Group recognises liabilities in respect of its obligations to deliver emissions allowances to the extent that the allowances to be delivered exceed the level of allocation under the EU emissions trading scheme. Any liabilities recognised are ###### measured based on the current estimates of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the obligation. A liability for the renewables obligation and the climate change levy is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers. A liability for the energy efficiency obligation under the EEOS is recognised if energy saving minimum targets are not achieved by the end of the compliance period. Any such liability is recognised on the compliance date (31 December) and is calculated by reference to the relevant penalty rates for volumes not achieved. Computer software The cost of acquiring computer software is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the Director’s estimate of its useful economic life which is between three and five years. The carrying value of computer software is reviewed for impairment where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Development assets Development assets arising from business combinations relate to value arising from the development of renewable projects which the Group believes will generate future economic benefits. Development assets are amortised from the date of commissioning of the renewable asset over its useful economic life which is twenty years. At a point the project is no longer expected to reach construction the carrying amount of the project is impaired. Customer acquisition costs The incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract within the Customer Solutions businesses are capitalised and amortised on a basis that reflects the transfer of goods or services to the customer. ----- #### (j) Leases ###### Right-of-use assets The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Leases of land and buildings generally have lease terms between 5 and 25 years, while motor vehicles and other equipment generally have lease terms between 3 and 5 years. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. ###### In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in- substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. #### (k) Financial instruments - initial recognition and subsequent measurement ###### A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), and fair value through the profit or loss. ----- ###### The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial assets’ contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. Except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price under IFRS 15. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘Solely Payments of Principal and Interest’ (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. The Group’s business model for management of financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether the cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. ###### Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified in four categories: • Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments); • Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments); • Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); and • Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments) This category is the most relevant to the Group. The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: • The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and • The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified, or impaired. ----- ###### This category generally applies to trade and other receivables. Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IFRS 9. The Group has not designated any financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair value presented as finance costs (negative net changes in fair value) or finance income (positive net changes in fair value) in the income statement. Derecognition A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group’s consolidated balance sheet) when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. ###### Impairment of financial assets The Group recognises an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposure for which there has not been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12 month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL). For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applied a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognised a loss allowance based on the lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 120 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicated that ----- ###### the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. Interest income For all financial instruments measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the EIR method. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. Interest income is included in finance income in the income statement. Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments. ###### Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement. This category generally applies to interest bearing loans and borrowings. This category also applies to trade and other payables which are not interest bearing and stated at their nominal amount. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. ----- #### (l) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting ###### Initial recognition and subsequent measurement The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts, interest rate swaps, contracts for differences and forward commodity contracts, to hedge its foreign currency risks, interest rate risks, electricity price risk and other commodity price risks, respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. The purchase contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under IFRS 9 are recognised in the income statement as operating costs. Commodity contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are held at cost. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in other comprehensive income and later reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss. For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: • fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment; ###### • cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment; or • hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Hedges that meet the strict criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are accounted for, as described below: Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement in operating costs. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the ----- ###### hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments, as well as forward commodity contracts for its exposure to volatility in the commodity prices. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency and commodity contracts is recognised in operating costs. The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in other comprehensive income for the period. For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flows occur, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above. #### (m) Impairment of non-financial assets ###### The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. ----- ###### Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. The following assets have specific characteristics for impairment testing: Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. #### (n) Cash and cash equivalents ###### Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits with a maturity of less than three months. #### (o) Provisions ###### General Provisions are recognised when (i) the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event (ii) it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and (iii) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is included within finance costs. Decommissioning liability Provision is made for estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the estimated useful lives of generation assets on a discounted basis based on price levels and technology at the balance sheet date. Changes in these estimates and changes to the discount rates are added to or deducted from the capitalised cost of the asset to which they relate. Capitalised decommissioning costs are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. ----- #### (p) Exceptional items and certain remeasurements ###### As permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial statements, the Group has disclosed additional information in respect of exceptional items on the face of the income statement to aid understanding of the Group’s financial performance. An item is treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by nature and scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. “Certain remeasurements” are remeasurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships, and which are accounted for as held for trading in accordance with the Group’s policy for such financial instruments. This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group’s own use requirements. Certain remeasurements arising from IFRS 9 are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. #### (q) Pensions and other post-employment benefits ###### The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements. The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of liabilities represents the present value of the obligations offset by the fair value of assets. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method. Pension remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses (excluding net interest), and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Pension remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of: • the date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and • the date that the Group recognises restructuring-related costs. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under operating costs in the consolidated income statement: • service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and • net interest expense or income. ----- ###### Pension costs in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the consolidated income statement as they become payable. #### (r) Inventories ###### Inventories are valued at the lower of average purchase price and net realisable value. #### (s) Borrowing costs ###### Borrowing costs directly attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. #### (t) Foreign currency translation ###### The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro. Energia Group Limited’s functional currency is sterling. For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. ###### Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Euro at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their income statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in other comprehensive income. #### (u) Share-based payments ###### Employees (senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 32. ----- ###### That cost is recognised in employee benefits expense (note 9), together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the consolidated income statement for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and / or performance conditions. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and / or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and / or service conditions are satisfied. ###### When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair value of the unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms of the award are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of modification, is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss. #### (v) Government Grant ###### Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. When the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the asset, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments. ----- #### (w) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions ###### The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and operating costs during the year. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. Judgements In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: Exceptional items and certain remeasurements The Group has disclosed additional information in respect of exceptional items on the face of the income statement to aid understanding of the Group’s financial performance. An item is treated as exceptional if it is considered unusual by nature and scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. “Certain remeasurements” are remeasurements arising on certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships, and which are accounted for as held for trading in accordance with the Group’s policy for such financial instruments. This excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group’s own use requirements. Exceptional items and certain remeasurements have been outlined in note 7. ###### Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. Revenue recognition Revenue on energy sales include an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This will have been estimated by using historical consumption patterns. At the balance sheet date, the estimated consumption by customers will either have been billed or accrued (estimated unbilled revenue). Management apply judgement to the measurement of the quantum and valuation of the estimated consumption including an estimate in respect of the impact of COVID-19 to the level of unbilled revenue recognised based on their assessment of the customer’s ability to pay. The judgements applied and the assumptions underpinning these judgements are considered to be appropriate. However, a change in these assumptions would impact upon the amount of revenue recognised. Revenue recognised in the period has been outlined in note 5. ----- ###### Impairment testing The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that the value of those assets is impaired. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the assets are allocated which includes the estimation of future cash flows and the application of a suitable discount rate. Subsequent changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the assets within the respective CGUs. Impairment testing has been outlined in note 14. Business combinations Business combinations require a fair value exercise to be undertaken to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based to a considerable extent on management’s judgement. The amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of this purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities with any unallocated portion being recorded as goodwill. Business combinations have been outlined in note 15. Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit method. The key assumptions used in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits are set after consultation with qualified actuaries. While these assumptions are considered to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group. Pensions and other post- employment benefits have been outlined in note 23. ###### Credit provisions for trade receivables The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and uses a provision matrix. The matrix approach allows application of different rates to different groups of customers with similar characteristics. The provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates. The Group then calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. The Group has adjusted the ECL matrix for the forecast impact of COVID-19 . Information on the ECLs on the Group’s trade receivables and contract assets together with further detail relating to the adjustments is disclosed in note 18. Provision for I-SEM resettlement The I-SEM market trading arrangements, which comprise a Day Ahead Market, Intra-Day Market and Balancing Market, have experienced volatility since the market commenced on 1 October 2018. The market has become more stable, with a number of fixes applied by the Market Operator, however the Group’s energy purchase and supply businesses remain exposed to energy price resettlement risks. As at 31 March 2021 the Market Operator has resettled these markets up to mid December 2020 for M+4 resettlement and mid March 2020 for M+13 resettlement in line with the expected market resettlement timetable of 4 months and 13 months after initial settlement. Further market fixes are required to be implemented before the market settlement solution can be considered fully aligned to the market code requirements, with a number of additional resettlements to occur ranging across the full 30-month period since the market commenced. ----- ###### The Group is therefore exposed to potential price resettlements in the balancing market and estimates the level of resettlement that may be applied. These estimates are based on known market anomalies as discussed in industry forums and facts and circumstances known at the Balance Sheet date. Estimations are dependent on the resettlement approach taken by the market operator. There is therefore a significant degree of judgement required in order to estimate the level of resettlement that will be applied. The current year estimate of c.6% (2020 - 15%) of balancing market revenues is considered a reasonable estimate and is supported by actual resettlements seen in the market to date, and reflect the various fixes applied by the market operator during the past 12 months. Further to the balancing market resettlement exposures outlined above, reflecting inaccuracies and errors at inception in the market code, the Group maintains provisions for potential incremental resettlement exposures in respect of fixed cost charges. A quantitative sensitivity analysis in relation to these key assumptions shows that if the percentage used in the resettlement provisions were to increase or decrease by 1% for balancing market exposures the impact of this would be an increase or decrease to operating profit respectively of €1.8m and for a 5% movement in the provision relevant to fixed costs charges, the impact of this would be an increase or decrease to operating profit respectively of €0.5m. #### (x) Standards issued but not yet effective ###### The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of the issuance of the Group’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective. Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform The amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The Group has had some initial discussions with Financial Institutions and is reviewing the impact of this for the year ahead. ----- #### 4. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS ###### For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services and has three reportable segments, as follows: (i) Renewables The Renewables business owns and operates 309MW of wind assets and purchases electricity from 1,284MW of renewable generation capacity throughout Ireland. In addition, the Renewables business is currently constructing a 4MW bioenergy plant in Dublin. (ii) Flexible Generation Consists of electricity generation from the Group’s two Huntstown CCGT plants together with the administration of the contracted generation capacity from the Ballylumford power station in NI under legacy generating unit agreements which were originally established in 1992 when the NI electricity industry was restructured; (iii) Customer Solutions Consists of the competitive supply of electricity and gas to business and residential customers in the RoI through its brand Energia, together with the supply of electricity to residential and business customers in NI through its brand Power NI. ###### The Group’s Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions with regard to resource allocation and performance assessment. The measure of profit used by the Board is pro-forma EBITDA which is operating profit before exceptional items and certain remeasurements (arising from certain commodity and currency contracts which are not designated in hedge accounting relationships) and based on regulated entitlement (whereby the adjustment for over / (under) - recovery outlined in the segmental analysis below represents the amount by which the regulated businesses over / (under) - recovered against their regulated entitlement).

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS     WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ###### The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill has been allocated to the following CGUs: |Col1|2021 €m|2020 €m| |---|---|---| |Current|84.9|68.0| |Non-current|654.7|630.1| ||739.6|698.1| |CGU|2021 €m|2020 €m| |---|---|---| |Customer Solutions - Energia|395.4|380.6| |Customer Solutions - Power NI|148.1|142.4| |Total goodwill|543.5|523.0| ###### The recoverable amount of the Energia and Power NI Customer Solutions CGUs has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using five year cash flow projections together with a long-term growth rate of 2% applied thereafter. The Group’s projections are based on past experience and reflect the Group’s forward view of market prices, risks and its strategic objectives. The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying amount of the CGU to determine whether the CGU is impaired. Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations Discount rates The pre-tax discount rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use for the CGUs was between 7.8% and 8.3% (2020 - 7.6% and 8.0%) reflecting management’s estimate of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) post-tax rate required to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals. ###### These rates reflect market projections of the risk- free rate in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, equity risk premiums and the cost of debt appropriate to the industry. Energia Customer Solutions CGU The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections of this CGU are based are as follows: (i) Retail supply revenues for electricity and gas are based on the expected market share derived from the market share at the time of the approval of the business model adjusted for forecasted growth. Growth in business customer numbers is modest and growth in respect of residential supply is moderate with cash flows associated with increased customer service and customer acquisition incorporated accordingly; and ----- ###### (ii) Retail supply margins are based on historic and projected gross margin percentages. Power NI Customer Solutions CGU The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections of this CGU are based are as follows: (i) Regulated revenues and margins are underpinned by the regulatory price control in place to 31 March 2023; (ii) Customer attrition is assumed, however the nature of the price control with regulated entitlement 70% fixed and 30% variable reduces the impact of customer losses; and (iii) Unregulated retail supply margins for business customers are based on historic and projected gross margin percentages. ###### Outcome of Tests The recoverable amount of both the Energia and Power NI Customer Solutions CGUs exceeded the respective carrying values at the time of the impairment test. While cash flows are subject to inherent uncertainty, reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions applied in assessing the value-in-use would not cause a change to the conclusion reached. ----- #### 15. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DISPOSALS ###### Acquisitions in 2021 On 16 April 2020 the Group completed the acquisition of the entire issued ordinary share capital of XMR Energy Limited (Crossmore), a 15MW windfarm development project in County Clare, RoI.

Contingent consideration is estimated as the present value of future cash flows disclosed at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. Derivatives are measured at fair value and are considered to fall within the level 1 fair value hierarchy. There have been no transfers between the levels within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Group’s project financed bank facilities (RoI), project financed bank facilities (NI) and Senior revolving credit facility are determined by using discounted cash flows based on the Group’s borrowing rate. The fair value of the Group’s Senior secured notes are based on the quoted market price. The fair value of interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange cross currency swaps and commodity contracts has been valued by calculating the present value of future cash flows, estimated using forward rates from third party market price quotations. ###### The fair value of the Group’s project financed bank facilities (RoI) and project financed bank facilities (NI) are a close approximation to their carrying value given that they bear interest at floating rates based on Libor/Euribor. The fair value of contingent consideration is considered to fall within the level 3 fair value hierarchy and is measured using the present value of the maximum amount payable with the minimum amount payable being €nil. Payment is contingent on various project milestones being met, primarily the construction and commissioning of the plant. The carrying value of €16.7m is estimated to approximate to its fair value determined by using discounted cash flows based on the Company’s borrowing rate. Reasonably possible changes in assumptions would not result in a material change to the value. ----- ###### Financial risk management objectives and policies A summary of the Group’s financial management objectives and policies is set out in the financial control section of the Risk Management and Principal Risks and Uncertainties report. ###### The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s trade and other payables, financial liabilities and derivatives based on contractual undiscounted payments: |Col1|Within one year €m|1 to 5 years €m|>5 years €m|Total €m|Carrying Value Total €m| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Year ended 31 March 2021|||||| |Trade and other payables (excluding tax and social security)|(382.4)|-|-|(382.4)|(382.4)| |Financial liabilities (excluding leases)|(59.3)|(846.6)|(269.3)|(1,175.2)|(979.4)| |Financial liabilities - leases|(3.1)|(11.4)|(36.6)|(51.1)|(33.9)| |Derivatives at fair value through other comprehensive income|(16.3)|(11.9)|(3.3)|(31.5)|(31.3)| |Derivative at fair value through profit and loss|(1.7)|(0.4)|-|(2.1)|(2.1)| ||(462.8)|(870.3)|(309.2)|(1,642.3)|(1,429.1)| ||||||| |Year ended 31 March 2020|||||| |Trade and other payables (excluding tax and social security)|(428.8)|-|-|(428.8)|(428.8)| |Financial liabilities (excluding leases)|(66.9)|(481.4)|(617.6)|(1,165.9)|(953.2)| |Financial liabilities - leases|(3.4)|(10.5)|(34.1)|(48.0)|(32.0)| |Derivatives at fair value through other comprehensive income|(59.0)|(27.5)|(9.9)|(96.4)|(96.1)| |Derivative at fair value through profit and loss|(8.1)|(0.3)|-|(8.4)|(8.4)| ||(566.2)|(519.7)|(661.6)|(1,747.5)|(1,518.5)| ###### The disclosed financial derivative instruments in the above table are the gross undiscounted cash flows.
