-----

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities may be relying on the
exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom (the
“UK”). The Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who: (i) are outside the UK; (ii) have
professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”);
(iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies, unincorporated associations,
etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order; or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as
amended (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant
**persons”). The Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied**
on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the Offering
Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.
No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the
issue or sale of the securities other than in instances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for such securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target
market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in
point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as
amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and, therefore,
offering or selling the securities to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

The securities are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means
a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (“UK MiFIR”) as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA MFIR. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law in the UK by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the**
UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

whatsoever in respect of any alterations to the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format.

# Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH


## €250,000,000 % Senior Secured Notes due 2031

Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, organized as a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) under German law (the “Issuer”), is
offering (the “Offering”) €250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior secured notes due 2031 (the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes will be
payable semi-annually in arrears on and of each year, commencing on July 15, 2024. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2031.

The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes on or after January 15, 2027 at the redemption prices set out in this offering memorandum. Prior to
January 15, 2027, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, plus the Applicable Premium, as described in this offering memorandum.
In addition, prior to, January 15, 2027, the Issuer may also redeem at its option up to 35% of the original principal amount of the Notes with the net
proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting
a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, we may
redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes.

The Notes will be governed by German law and will constitute senior obligations of the Issuer, will be secured by first ranking liens over the Collateral
(as defined below) (although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Liabilities and
Cash Management Liabilities (each as defined herein) that are secured by the Collateral will receive priority over the Notes with respect to any proceeds
received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral), will rank equal among themselves and equal in right of payment with all existing and future
obligations of the Issuer that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness
of the Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
indebtedness, will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes, and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors (as defined
below).

The Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (the “Guarantors”). The Notes will initially be

Verwaltungs-GmbH, certain machinery and equipment and real property in Germany, certain machinery and equipment in the United Kingdom as well
as any loans of the Parent against the Issuer (the “Collateral”) as described in more detail under “Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release
_of Collateral”. The Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral will be subject to certain significant contractual and legal limitations and_
subject to certain defenses under applicable law. Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its
priority retained through certain actions which, in the case of some Collateral, may not be completed until after the Issue Date. See “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability”. The Guarantees and the security interests may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral and the Guarantees_
_may be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Holders’ Representative”, “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor_
_Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release of Collateral”._

This offering memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and the Guarantees, including with regard to redemption and repurchase
prices, guarantees, covenants and transfer restrictions. The Notes will be represented by global notes deposited with Clearstream Banking AG, Frankfurt
am Main, Germany (“Clearstream Banking”). Definitive notes representing individual Notes will not be issued. Transfer of the Notes will be subject to
the rules of Clearstream Banking and the terms of a book entry registration agreement (“Book Entry Registration Agreement”) among Clearstream
Banking and the Issuer with respect to the Notes. The Notes will be issued in denominations of €1,000 and will be transferable only in minimum
aggregate principal amounts of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be ready for delivery, in book entry form only,

that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted, or that such listing will be
maintained.

to any person in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Neither the delivery of

that there has been no change in the affairs of the Issuer since the date of this offering memorandum or that
the information contained in this offering memorandum is correct as of any time subsequent to that date.

By receiving this offering memorandum, investors acknowledge that they have had an opportunity to request
for review, and have received, all additional information they deem necessary to verify the accuracy and

This Offering is being made in reliance upon exemptions from registration under the U.S. Securities Act for an
offer and sale of securities that does not involve a public offering. The Notes and the Guarantees have not

permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws
pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum
or any of the Notes come must inform themselves about and observe any such restrictions. None of the Issuer,

offeree or any purchaser of the Notes regarding the legality of any investment in the Notes by such offeree or
purchaser under applicable investment or similar laws or regulations. For a further description of certain
restrictions on the offering and sale of the Notes and the distribution of this offering memorandum, see

for investors to purchase, offer or sell any of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction to which investors are subject. None of the Issuer, its respective affiliates or the Initial Purchasers
will have any responsibility, therefore.

No action has been taken by the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other person that would
permit an offering of the Notes or the circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any offering
material in relation to the Issuer or its affiliates or the Notes in any country or jurisdiction where action for

**OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE STABILIZING**
**MANAGER (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) WILL**
**UNDERTAKE STABILIZATION ACTION. ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR**
**AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE FINAL TERMS OF**
**THE OFFER OF THE NOTES IS MADE AND, IF BEGUN, MAY BE ENDED AT ANY TIME, BUT**
**MUST END NO LATER THAN THE EARLIER OF 30 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE ISSUE DATE**
**OF THE NOTES AND 60 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE ALLOTMENT OF THE**
**NOTES.**

**SETTLEMENT CYCLE**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefore on or about the date specified
on the cover page of the offering memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ “). Under Rule 15(c)6 1 under the
U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding
business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the
next succeeding business days should consult their own advisor.

**EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any member state of
the European Union (each such state an “EU Member State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under
the Prospectus Regulation (as defined below) from a requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the
Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the Prospectus Regulation. The
expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of June 14, 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or
admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC, and includes any relevant
delegated regulations and regulatory technical standards enacted pursuant thereto.

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the European Economic Area (“EEA”)
of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer, the Guarantors
or any Initial Purchaser to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors nor any
Initial Purchaser has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of Notes through any
financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the final placement
of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, distributed or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance
**Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10)**
of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors
in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes described in this offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**France**

This Offering Memorandum has not been prepared in the context of a public offering (other than to qualified
investors in France) within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code
(Code monétaire et financier). Consequently, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the
public in France (other than to qualified investors) and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
offering material may be distributed or caused to be distributed and will not be distributed or caused to be
distributed to the public in France (other than to qualified investors only). Such offers, sales and distributions
will only be made in France to qualified investors (investisseurs qualifiés) as defined in point (e) of Article 2 of
the Prospectus Regulation and/or to a limited circle of investors (cercle restreint d’investisseurs) each acting
for their own accounts, as defined in and in accordance with Articles L. 411-1, L. 411-2 and D. 411-4 of the
French Monetary and Financial Code. Prospective investors are informed that: (i) neither this Offering
Memorandum, nor any other materials relating to the Notes, has been and will be submitted for clearance to,
approval by, or registration with, the Autorité des marchés financiers; (ii) in compliance with Articles L. 411-2,
D. 411- 4, D. 762-1, D. 763-1 and D. 764-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, any qualified investors
subscribing for the Notes should be acting for their own account; and (iii) the direct and indirect distribution
or sale to the public of the Notes acquired by them may be made in compliance with Articles L. 411-1,
L. 411-2, L. 412-1 and L. 621-8 through L. 621-8-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.

**Germany**

The Offering is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Notes may not be offered and
sold in the Federal Republic of Germany except in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Prospectus
Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (Wertpapierprospektgesetz) (as amended, the “German Securities


-----

**Prospectus Act”), the Prospectus Regulation and any other laws applicable in Germany. This offering**
memorandum has not been and will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the
German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”).
BaFin has not obtained and will not obtain a notification from another competent authority of a member
state of the European Union (each a Member State), with which a securities prospectus may have been filed,
pursuant to Article 25 of the Prospectus Regulation. The Notes must not be distributed within Germany by
way of a public offer, public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this offering memorandum and any
other document relating to the Notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the
public in Germany or used in connection with any offer for subscription of Notes to the public in Germany.
Consequently, in Germany the Notes will only be available to, and this offering memorandum and any other
offering material in relation to the Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte
_Anleger) within the meaning of Section 2 No. 6 of the German Securities Prospectus Act in connection with_
Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus Regulation. Any resale of the Notes in Germany may only be made in
accordance with the German Securities Prospectus Act and other applicable laws.

**United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters
relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial

Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial
Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated
or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons”). This
offering memorandum is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons
who are not Relevant Persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum
relates is permitted only by Relevant Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons.

**THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH YOU**
**SHOULD READ BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISION WITH RESPECT TO AN INVESTMENT IN**
**THE NOTES.**


-----

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws of
certain applicable jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all
statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this offering memorandum, including,
without limitation, those regarding our future financial position and results of operations, our strategy, plans,
objectives, goals and targets, future developments in the markets in which we participate or are seeking to
participate or anticipated regulatory changes in the markets in which we operate or intend to operate. In some
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “aim”, “anticipate”, “believe”,
“continue”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “guidance”, “intend”, “may”, “ongoing”, “plan”,
“potential”, “predict”, “projected”, “propose”, “seek”, “should”, “targets” or “will” or the negative of such
terms or other variation or comparable terminology.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We
caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on
numerous assumptions and that our actual results of operations, including our financial condition and
liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be more
negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this offering
memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity
and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or
developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these
differences include, but are not limited to:

- fluctuations in the costs of our raw materials and other input costs and our ability to pass on increases to
our customers;

- increases in energy costs and loss of financial privileges in this respect;

- risks related to adverse and uncertain global economic and political conditions;

- currency exchange rate fluctuations;

- the availability of, and increases in the costs of, transportation;

- changes in the purchasing behavior of our customers;

- pricing pressure, consolidation of our customers and competition in the markets in which we operate;

- failure to implement our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 and related programs;

- loss of key customers or key personnel;

- strikes or other labor disputes with our work force;

- break-down of any of our equipment or industrial accidents;

- non-compliance with governmental regulations, laws or standards;

- risks associated with conducting business in multiple countries;

- risks related to proprietary rights and other litigation or claims;

- exposure to a data security incident or other technology incident impacting our business;

- adverse effects arising from costs and difficulties of acquiring and integrating complementary businesses;

- availability of our most important raw materials and climate-related risks;

- dependency on outside suppliers and interruptions of our supply chain;

- alignment of interests with our family-owners and management;

- tax risks attributable to previous tax assessment periods and risks associated with restrictions on the
deduction of interest expense or forfeiture of interest carry forwards under German tax laws;

- our substantial leverage and debt service obligations;

- limited operating and financial flexibility due to financial and restrictive covenants in our debt
agreements, including the covenants contained in the Conditions of Issue, the conditions of issue of the
Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility;


-----

- risks associated with the transaction, our capital structure, the Notes, the Guarantees, our other
indebtedness and our group structure;

- force majeure and other unforeseeable events; and

- other factors discussed or referred to in this offering memorandum.

The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this offering memorandum are not exhaustive. Other
sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive industry. New
risks may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the
impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this offering memorandum entitled “Risk Factors”,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry and
_Competition” and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future_
performance and the markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the
forward-looking statements described in this offering memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all.

Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date on which the statements were made (and in any case no later than the date of
this offering memorandum). In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives, acting in respect of
information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These
forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press releases (including on our
website), reports to our security holders and other communications. Although we believe that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations
will prove to be correct.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statements or risk
factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent
written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**General**

In this offering memorandum, the term “financial statements” refers to the audited consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto of the Issuer and its subsidiaries as of and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023
as well as from the accounting records and other internal documents of the Issuer. The results of operations
for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future
period. The audit opinions of KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft with respect to the consolidated
financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are included in this
offering memorandum beginning on page F-1. Furthermore, we have included in this offering memorandum
the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023, which include comparative figures for the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022.

In addition, this offering memorandum includes certain unaudited consolidated financial information for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023. This information was derived by adding our consolidated financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2022 derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
to our unaudited consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and
subtracting our unaudited consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

This offering memorandum also includes certain unaudited consolidated financial information for the twomonth periods ended November 30, 2022 and 2023, respectively. This information is based on internal
unaudited consolidated monthly accounts, which were prepared by and are the responsibility of our
management. This financial information has not been audited, reviewed, compiled or the subject of any
procedures by our independent auditors or any other audit firm and no opinion nor any other form of
assurance is expressed with respect thereto. The foregoing financial information is inherently subject to
modification during the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023. The presented financial information is not representative for any three-month or any twelve-month
period and should not be regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person
regarding our financial performance for the three-month period or the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023
or regarding our future financial performance.

Our financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with
German GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from IFRS. For a discussion of significant
differences between German GAAP and IFRS, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Significant Differences between German GAAP and IFRS”._

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering to
which this offering memorandum relates and of the financial statements and financial information contained
in this offering memorandum. We do not present separate financial statements of the Guarantors in this
offering memorandum, because all such entities are wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by the Issuer, and the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of such entities are therefore consolidated within our
financial statements contained herein.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting
requirements of the SEC.

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data and operational
volumes presented in million or thousand and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to
rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly
from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. The financial information and financial statements
included in this offering memorandum are presented in euro. Amounts presented in euro per ton are not part
of the financial statements but are taken from the management reporting of the Group.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain non-GAAP measures and ratios, including gross profit,
EBITDA, EBITDA margin, EBIT, income/(loss) before tax, trade working capital, free cash flow, free cash
flow, free cash flow (adjusted for ABS Program) and pro forma data that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, German GAAP. Our management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP
measures is helpful to investors because these and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors,


-----

security analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.
However, you should not construe these non-GAAP measures as an alternative to net income determined in
accordance with German GAAP or to cash flows from operating activities, investing activities or financing
activities. In addition, the non-GAAP measures and ratios, including gross profit, EBITDA, EBITDA margin,
EBIT, income/(loss) before tax, trade working capital, free cash flow, free cash flow, free cash flow (adjusted
for ABS Program) and pro forma data presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies.


-----

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We operate in an industry for which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information. Market
data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used, and statements regarding our position in the
industry made, in this offering memorandum are based upon market research, government and other publicly
available information, reports prepared by independent industry consultants and independent industry
publications. In particular, we used data extracted from “Outlook for World Tissue Business 10-year,
Volume 12”, number 1 published by RISI, Inc. (“RISI”) in 2022 (the “RISI-Report”). We also used data
extracted from Pulpwatch Market Trends report, published by Hawkins Wright in October 2023, among
others. The information in this offering memorandum that has been sourced from third parties has been
accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by
such third parties, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or
misleading. While we believe the statements included in such third-party publications to be reliable, they have
not been independently verified, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or
warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this offering memorandum.
Additionally, industry publications and such reports generally state that the information contained therein
has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such
information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such
information. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The information available to market
_analysts varies in its degree of comparability”. Some industry publications publish or provide projections or_
other forward-looking statements that, by their very nature, involve inherent risks and uncertainties and past
projections or forward-looking statements have turned out to be inaccurate. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements”. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can therefore assure you of the accuracy and completeness_
of such information as we have not independently verified such information.

In addition, certain information in this offering memorandum regarding our industry and our market position
is not based on published statistical data or information obtained from independent third parties. Such
information and statements reflect our estimates based upon information obtained from trade and business
organizations and associations and other contacts within the industry in which we compete, internal surveys
and assumptions we deem reasonable, as well as information published by our competitors. To the extent that
information in this offering memorandum is identified as being our belief, that information is based on the
following: (i) in respect of industry trends, our senior management’s general business experience, as well as
their experience in our industry and the markets in which we operate, and (ii) in respect of the performance of
our operations, our internal analysis of our audited and unaudited financial and other information. As some
of the foregoing information was compiled or provided by our management and is not publicly available, such
information accordingly may not be considered to be as independent as that provided by other third-party
sources.

For example, certain information in this offering memorandum regarding our estimated share of the private
label tissue market in different geographies is based on our internal private label mapping during the course of
2022 (our “Internal Private Label Mapping 2022”). As the RISI Report, for example, only includes data about
the overall private label tissue market, we conduct our own research to allow us to estimate and track our own
market share in the private label tissue market. As part of this research, members of our own salesforce collect
what we consider to be representative product samples across selected retail stores in each of our core markets.
Based on product codes and other identifying information of these samples, we then attempt to project,
approximate and estimate our own market share as well as the market shares of other private label producers
in each market. We believe that the research methods and procedures as well as the assumptions we use in our
Internal Private Label Mapping 2022 are reasonable and consistent with established industry practice, and we
also try to sense-check our projections and estimates by cross-checking them against information about total
values of the relevant tissue markets from the RISI Report. We therefore also believe the resulting projections
and estimates of market shares to be fair approximations of our actual market share in each relevant market
that are useful in helping us manage our business. However, the relevant estimates and projections, by their
nature, involve method-based simplifications and uncertainties, and there is no guarantee that our actual
private label market shares may not differ from the estimated private label market shares set forth in this
offering memorandum. Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on, and be
conscious of the approximative character of, the estimated private label market shares as set forth in this
offering memorandum.


-----

**CURRENCY PRESENTATION AND EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

In this offering memorandum, all references to “euro”, “EUR” or “€” are to the single currency of the

**OUR COMPANY**

We are a leading European, family-owned producer and supplier of tissue products with a market share (by
production volumes) of 8.1% in Europe and 10.2% in Western Europe, both according to RISI. Based on our
Internal Private Label Mapping 2022, we believe we are the leading private label consumer tissue paper
producer in our core markets of Germany, the BeNeLux region, France and Italy with a market share, by
volume, between approximately 17–32% in these markets. In addition, we believe we are the second largest
private label consumer tissue paper producer in the UK and the third largest in Poland. We are convinced we
differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our strong and future-oriented commitment to the
European tissue paper business, with a clear focus on sustainability, product innovation and continuous
strategic investments in our asset base.

Headquartered in Arnsberg, Germany, we offer a full range of folded and rolled tissue products such as toilet
paper, kitchen towels, handkerchiefs, hand towels, facial tissues, napkins, industrial paper rolls and paper
towels as well as semi-finished products (i.e. jumbo reels and de-inked pulp). We produce our tissue products
on 22 paper machines and over 80 converting lines. Our fourteen production sites are located strategically
across Europe in Germany, Italy, France, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and we had an
average of 3,785 employees in 2022. Our production capacities make us the third largest producer of tissue
products (by volume) in the European tissue market, a market exhibiting resilient demand characteristics with
low product substitution risk. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have an installed tissue paper
production capacity of 850,000 tons and an installed tissue paper converting capacity of 847,000 tons to
convert tissue paper into tissue products. Approximately 48% of our production capacity and 45% of our
converting capacity is located in Germany, our core market and Europe’s largest tissue market. We also own
technologically advanced facilities for the production of de-inked pulp from recovered paper, with an annual
capacity of more than 390,000 tons. Due to this and our long-standing focus on sustainable products and
production, we believe we are the largest producer of tissue products from recovered paper and hybrid
products in Europe, with total sales of €1,636.4 million in 2022. In the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2023, we sold 724,000 tons of finished tissue products, 35,000 tons of de-inked pulp and 29,000
tons of jumbo reels across Europe, which generated €1,865.1 million and €318.2 million of sales and EBITDA,
respectively, in such period.

We operate our business primarily through our two business units Consumer and Professional. In our
Consumer business unit, we are a private-label specialist for European retailers, selling our tissue products
branded under our retail customers’ own labels. Our Professional business unit with the brands BlackSatino
and Satino by WEPA stands for sustainable and professional hygiene solutions for large commercial and
institutional customers, served through leading distributors. In addition to our two core business units, and in
line with our vision to be the most sustainable, best-in-class partner for personal and professional hygiene
solutions, we have recently set up a “New Business Areas” business unit, focusing on the expansion of our
product and service portfolio, in particular through innovation, e-commerce and circular economy.

Our Consumer business unit, which represented 85% of our sales from finished products in our financial year
2022 and 86% of our sales from finished products in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023,
offers a full range of consumer tissue products: toilet paper, kitchen towels, facial tissues, handkerchiefs and
napkins. While the key focus of our Consumer business unit is on the private label sector, we also market some
products under our own brands such as Mach m!t…, Comprami, Perla and Scala. Our Professional business
unit, which has a more regional focus within Central Europe and Poland, focuses on tissue products for large
commercial and institutional customers, such as government agencies, hotels, restaurants, private enterprises,
hospitals and other healthcare providers. It offers a broad range of tissue products with a focus on our own
brands Satino by WEPA and BlackSatino, including toilet paper and paper towels, industrial rolls, kitchen
rolls as well as accessories like comprehensive dispenser systems for washrooms. In addition to the brand
business, our Professional business unit offers also private label and unbranded products. In both
business units, we also generate revenues from the sale of semi-finished products, such as de-inked pulp and
jumbo reels, with the amount of such sales varying and primarily depending on our own internal demand.

**OUR STRENGTHS**

We believe that we benefit from the following strengths.

**_Leading Market Positions in Attractive and Resilient End-Markets_**

We are the third largest producer by volume of tissue products in Western Europe, having increased our
market share in Europe from 6.9% in 2015 to 8.1% in 2022 according to RISI. In addition, we believe we are
the largest producer of private label consumer tissue products across our core markets, by volume. For
example, in our home market Germany, which is also our biggest market, we are the largest private label
consumer tissue producer, holding a market share of 28.5% by volume, and we also believe we hold leading
market positions in private label consumer tissue production in each of our other core markets France (first
by capacity, holding a market share of 32.9%), the BeNeLux region (first by capacity, holding a market share


-----

of 27.6%), Italy (first by capacity, holding a market share of 16.8%), the United Kingdom (second by capacity,
holding a market share of 22.1%) and Poland (third by capacity, holding a market share of 16.9%), all based
on our Internal Private Label Mapping 2022. With regard to sustainable tissue products, we believe we are the
largest producer of tissue products from recovered paper and hybrid products in Europe, with total volumes
of approximately 294,000 tons in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023. Above all, we believe
that our significant existing scale, purchasing power, geographic coverage and strategically well-positioned
production sites give us a competitive advantage over smaller players and enhance our ability to compete with
other leading players in these markets more effectively. Additionally, we believe our competitive position
profits from our clear and future-oriented commitment to the European private label segment in the Consumer
business unit, focusing on long-term strategic customer relations, providing supply reliability, product
innovations and improvement potential for our customers’ sustainability footprint.

Our core tissue products benefit from utility-like consumer demand, high penetration rates, low substitution
risk and resilient demand characteristics. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a generally
increased awareness of hygiene and, as a result, demand for tissue products. Tissue consumption has seen
stable growth rates in Western Europe and strong growth rates in Eastern Europe. According to RISI,
consumption of tissue products in Western Europe grew by an average of 0.7% per annum and in Eastern
Europe by an average of 4.6% per annum between 2011 and 2021, to 6.8 million tons and 2.5 million tons of
tissue, respectively, in 2021. Demand for our core consumer tissue products increased by an average of 1.0%
per annum between 2011 and 2021 in Western Europe and by an average of 4.8% per annum in Eastern
Europe. For the period between 2021 and 2031, RISI expects the average growth rate of tissue consumption in
Western Europe to increase to 1.1% per annum, with growth rates in Eastern Europe expected to continue to
exceed rates in Western Europe, primarily due to the still significantly lower per capital consumption of tissue
paper in many Eastern European countries. We believe that demographic changes, increased urbanization,
higher product penetration levels, developments in tissue quality as well as increased pressure on our customers
to meet their self-imposed sustainability goals (where they are widely dependent on suppliers to provide
sustainably sourced raw materials due to the nature of the retail business model) will continue to underpin
demand growth for our products.

Unlike many of our competitors who serve both the branded and the private label sectors, our Consumer
business unit focuses on the key private label sector. Both in 2022 and the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023, 97% of the sales of the Consumer business unit related to private label sales. The private
label sector represented 78.2% (by volume) of the overall German tissue market in 2022, according to RISI,
and also accounts for the majority of the overall tissue market in many other European markets in which we
operate. The overall market share of private label tissue products, by volume, relative to branded products, has
increased in Western Europe from 64.4% in 2015 to 71.5% in 2022, according to RISI. This increase has been
driven by the expansion of discount retailers, who primarily sell private label goods, an increased share of
private label tissue products being sold by non-discount retailers as well as by consumers substituting higherpriced branded products with lower-priced private label products of comparable quality.

We believe that our focus on the private label sector, combined with our significant existing scale and
purchasing power, our European network of fourteen strategically located production sites, our recent
investments into expanding and optimizing our production capabilities as well as our high quality and
sustainable products make us an attractive partner for large retailers (our key customers) across Europe and
positions us well to solidify our market leading positioning in the Consumer business, while capturing further
growth opportunities in this attractive and generally resilient market.

Our Professional business unit, which focuses on sales to large commercial and institutional customers, such
as government agencies, hotels, restaurants, private enterprises, hospitals and other healthcare providers,


-----

generated €229.1 million in sales or 15.5% of our total sales from finished products in 2022. We believe that we
have a market share of 6% in the away-from-home segment in Western Europe. While tissue consumption in
this segment has not yet reached pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, demand has started to recover, with a further
positive development and a positive outlook predicted by RISI. For the period from 2021 to 2026, RISI
expects the average growth rate of away-from-home tissue consumption in Western Europe to be 2.5% per
annum, and 1.3% per annum between 2026 and 2031, and therefore to exceed the expected growth rates in the
consumer tissue business. We believe that, with our strong existing Professional platform, combined with our
focus on sustainable products and our recent product innovations such as fibers from old corrugated board
(“OCC”) and miscanthus grass, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth of the away-from-home
tissue market and the market trend that customers request more sustainable products to meet their own
sustainability targets.

**_Strong and Long-Standing and Well-Diversified Customer Relationships_**

We have strong and long-standing customer relationships, with some of our key customer relationships dating
back more than 40 years, and the relationships with many of our top ten customers (by volume) in 2022
existing for more than 20 years. We have historically grown mostly with our large German customers as they
have expanded across Europe, but we have also significantly diversified our client base over the last decade
both by acquiring businesses with an existing customer-base in several of the markets in which we operate
today and by successfully entering into new relationships with key customers in our markets.

Our growing geographic coverage, our production and supply chain excellence as well as our significant
investments into expanding and optimizing our production capacities, have allowed us to gain new customers
and to strengthen the relationship with existing customers. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we
supply approximately 460 customers across our Consumer and Professional business units and we have welldiversified customer relationships. In our Consumer business unit, our customers include Aldi, dm, Edeka,
Lidl, Müller, Netto and REWE in Germany, Auchan, Carrefour, Casino, Intermarché and Leclerc in France,
Esselunga and Eurospin in Italy, Biedronka in Poland, Aldi, Coop and Tesco in the United Kingdom and
Colruyt and Superunie in the BeNeLux region. In addition, we supply IKEA worldwide with napkins. Our
Professional business unit serves leading distributors in the professional hygiene sector, such as GVS eG,
igefa, Abena, Metro Cash & Carry, CWS and MTS, cash & carry wholesalers as well as distributors for office
supplies.

As a result of our significant volume growth over the last decade, we have been able to further diversify our
customer base and the relative portion of our sales to our long-standing largest customer Lidl has decreased
to 16% of our total sales in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to historic levels of
25% in 2012. Overall, we achieved this diversification without losing significant volumes from any of our key
customers.

Tesco 7%


Others 48%


Rewe 5%

Edeka 5%

In addition to diversification in our customer base, we are also diversified from a geographical perspective.
While our total sales of finished products in the DACH region amounted to 39% in the twelve-month period
ended September 30, 2023, France, the BeNeLux region, the UK, Italy and Poland each accounted for 17%,
14%, 14%, 7% and 5%, respectively, during such period. We believe that our geographic diversification is and
has been an advantage compared to other, more regional competitors, particularly during the COVID-19
pandemic and the 2022 energy crisis. During these crises, we were able to balance our production across our
European mills, avoiding the need to outsource production externally.

We believe our performance and reliability throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and periods marked by
extreme energy price peaks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at times forced certain other
market participants to reduce or suspend product deliveries, has further strengthened our reputation. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to demonstrate to our customers that we are a reliable, innovative and
transparent partner, ensuring both supply security and solid quality standards, while certain of our
competitors were not able to comply with their contractual supply commitments. At the same time, in light of
the significant supply chain issues in the market and tissue producers suffering from high energy costs, our
customers increasingly realized the value of long-term and fair arrangements with reliable and resilient
suppliers. We closely partnered with many of our customers to mitigate the negative consequences of the
energy crisis on various stakeholders, including our customers and their end consumers. As part of this
process, for many of our customers, we have been able to shorten the price cycles from previously one year to
periods of three to six months, allowing for a faster pass through of input cost increases to our customers.

In addition, we also believe that our ability to supply high quality, cost efficient and innovative products has
enabled us to benefit from a continuing trend among major retailers to consolidate their supplier bases and
work with larger partners that have the required scale, competencies and capacity to supply them efficiently
with a consistent quality across their markets and with partners that can enable them to execute their
sustainability strategy. In many instances, we are operating as a fundamental part of the supply chains of our
key customers, by improving their inventory management, security of supply and customer service. As part of
our new “concept supplier” strategy, and as further described under “—Our Strategy—Partner of Choice for
_Our Customers”, we offer the relevant customers cross-functional collaboration and to closely align our_
strategic plans with their strategic priorities, in particular in relation to the introduction and development of
new sustainable and/or innovative products, customer brands and value-added services.

**_Innovation Leader with a long-standing Focus on Sustainable Products and Production_**

As early as 1983, we began producing recycled tissue paper and subsequently started to invest significantly in
facilities for the recycling of recovered paper and in developing recycled tissue products. In 2010, we were the
first tissue producer in Europe to launch a range of high quality “hybrid” toilet paper and kitchen towels
based on fresh fiber, but with a minimum of 30% of recycled fiber content added to the raw material mix.
Over the years, we have gained significant additional expertise in recycled and hybrid products, be it from
improved quality (i.e. brightness, softness), different input fibers, including most recently OCC, and flexible
hybrid grades with different fiber shares of different fresh fibers like pulp or from miscanthus grass. Today, we
believe we are the leading producer of tissue products from recovered paper and hybrid products in Europe by
volume. Our leading market position in the field of recycled and hybrid tissue products is supported by our
well-invested asset base for the recycling of recovered paper in Arnsberg, Giershagen, Mainz and Kriebstein,
Germany, Swalmen, the Netherlands, Piechowice, Poland and Château-Thierry, France, with a total annual
stock preparation capacity of more than 390,000 tons of de-inked pulp.

In addition to our strong focus on recovered paper for the production of tissue paper, we have also become an
innovation leader for sustainable tissue products and operations. Driven by an increasing dependency of our
retail customers on their suppliers to meet their own sustainability goals and following a continuously
increasing end-consumer demand in products from sustainable fibers, we have focused on the development of
new sustainable tissue products as part of our 4+1 sustainability strategy, as further described under “—Our
_Strategy—Strong Commitment to Sustainability”. For example, we have successfully launched tissue products_
made from OCC, a fiber which can be reused multiple times before becoming tissue fiber, which in most cases
is also the end-use, and which has, as a recycled fiber, a reduced ecological footprint of 70% compared to pure


-----

pulp. Due to steadily shrinking availability of high bright graphic paper for recycling purposes, products
made from OCC have a significant potential for further growth. We have also launched a new fiber production
based on miscanthus grass. Miscanthus grass can be grown on fields that are no longer suitable for agriculture
due to exhausted soil. It can grow on those fields for several years, resulting in a better environmental footprint
compared to wood plantations. Our current test line for the production of miscanthus grass-based fibers has
a capacity of 350 tons per annum. In light of the significant potential of such fiber and the fact that we are
already successfully distributing our first miscanthus-based products, we have recently started the construction
of a production line with an annual production capacity of 8,000 tons. The ramp-up of this production line is
expected for 2025.

As a result of our long-standing focus on sustainable tissue products and operations, we believe we are
particularly well-positioned to benefit from demand trends for more sustainable products. In the twelvemonth period ended September 30, 2023, approximately 50% of the finished products produced by us
consisted of recycled or hybrid tissue products, with 22.2% of our finished products being recycled paperbased products (of which 0.6%, or approximately 4,700 tons, related to our new OCC-based products in the
first year of introduction) and 25.4% being hybrid paper products. We further sold 35,000 tons of de-inked
pulp in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023. In addition to the clear benefits of recycled and
hybrid tissue products from an ecological and sustainability perspective, we believe that our strength and
expertise in recycled and (in particular) hybrid tissue products give us significant commercial advantages. It
allows us to diversify our product portfolio, helps us balance fluctuations in the price of raw materials (i.e.,
soften the impact of price increases for fresh fiber) and opens up opportunities to improve our margins as well
as our customers´ margins for value added by incorporating recycled fiber into higher quality/value products
(i.e. by convincing customers to partially substitute lower quality recycled tissue products with hybrid or OCC
products). Our efforts producing recycled and hybrid tissue products have been validated with various ecolabels and certifications for our products, such as the EU Ecolabel, the “Blue Angel” (“Blauer Engel”) label in
Germany, the European Eco Label and the Nordic Swan for Europe. Furthermore, we were also awarded with
a Silver Star award in EcoVadis’s sustainability rating, our miscanthus-based product line BlackSatino
GreenGrow has been awarded with the Purus Innovation Award 2023 and our Satino PureSoft products,
made from OCC, have been awarded with the German Bundespreis Ecodesign 2023 award.

**_Efficient Production via Well-Invested and Strategically Located Asset Base_**

We operate fourteen production sites, including one focused solely on raw-material production (de-inked
pulp), strategically located across Europe in Germany, Italy, France, Poland, the Netherlands and the UK.
This network largely mirrors the footprint of our key pan-European customers and thus enables us to supply
our customers in a timely, cost-effective manner. Mainly due to disproportionally high freight costs relative to
the value of products shipped, it is not economical for participants in our industry to supply customers more
than a certain distance from a particular production site. The alignment of our production sites with the
geographic footprint of our major customers is therefore an important competitive advantage. In addition,
our geographic footprint enables us to reduce delivery times and, typically, to guarantee delivery to our
customers within a short and competitive time from the receipt of an order. Our geographic footprint also
permits us to optimize our inventories by shortening the supply chain which, in turn, lowers our storage and
transportation costs. It further allows us to align our individual production sites with the preferences of endcustomers in specific regions, which improves our product offering, service quality, reliability and efficiency.
During the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the energy crisis as a consequence of the Russian invasion in
Ukraine, our European footprint provided us with the necessary degree of flexibility to continue our
production at the required level and serve our customers’ needs.

We are convinced that the continuous strategic development of our asset base remains key to our continued
success as a leading, cost efficient tissue producer in Europe. To further strengthen our market position and
competitiveness, we implemented a number of strategic capital expenditure projects between 2020 and 2023,
notwithstanding the special challenges we faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian
invasion of Ukraine. In that period, we invested a total of €316 million into our business. This includes an
investment of €122 million in two new, highly efficient paper machines at our production sites in Piechowice,
Poland and Bridgend, UK. We also successfully completed a pan-European investment project which included
11 new converting lines for our plants in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK. Additionally,
we have taken strategic measures to allow a fast shift to different energy sources such as liquified natural gas
and oil in the event of a gas shortage. As part of our project “Bluetec”, we have developed alternative energy
sources for the paper drying process in paper machines, such as electricity, steam or thermal oil instead of
direct gas firing, and have installed 2.9MW of solar capacity on the roofs of our facilities at our production
sites in Swalmen, the Netherlands, and Salanetti, Italy, with further installations planned at other production
sites, including an extension of the existing solar capacity in Salanetti, Italy.

With our latest acquisition of a stock preparation unit (used for the preparation of de-inked pulp from
recovered paper) located in close proximity to our tissue paper manufacturing site in Kriebstein, Germany,
which we acquired from the insolvent Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH in June 2023, we
believe we have generated synergies for our manufacturing sites in Kriebstein and Leuna, Germany and
Piechowice, Poland with regard to efficiency and cost savings, as well as increased flexibility for the Group.
With the addition of the former Kübler & Niethammer stock preparation unit to our de-inked pulp capacities,
we have increased our stock preparation capacity by 43,500 tons p.a. and thereby widely balanced our
integrated internal production of de-inked pulp with our actual demand for recycled tissue. This gives us the
opportunity to further focus our specialized de-inked pulp mill in Château-Thierry on differentiated fiber
production from circular economy and offer alternative and more sustainable fibers either to third parties or
to further grow our sustainable product portfolio. This includes a broader co-operation approach, e.g., the
most recent joint venture for production of biogas from recycled paper scrap in Château-Thierry as a first
step.

**_Strong and Proven Financial Track Record, providing Stability even in very Challenging Market Environments_**

Over the last years, we have significantly strengthened our financial resilience. In particular, we have
(i) substantially diversified our customer base and expanded our product portfolio, (ii) reduced or exited
unprofitable business lines (e.g. the crepe business), customer relationships and markets, (iii) expanded our
geographic footprint in new and/or attractive target markets, (iv) significantly reduced our reliance on fresh
fiber as our main raw material (e.g. by continuing to develop our hybrid products) and focused on innovations
around using more recycled- or alternative fiber tissue products (such as fibers from OCC and fibers made
from miscanthus grass) and (v) continued to significantly invest in further optimizing and expanding our
asset base, including targeted expansion investments and sustainable capacity management measures intended
to drive further cost reductions, portfolio optimization and efficiency improvements and working capital
reductions such as our 2 new, highly efficient paper machines and our 11 new converting lines. In addition to
these measures, we have successfully carried on our continuous improvement process, a systematic and
ongoing program to continuously improve our profitability and cash position. We have also continued to
refine our adaptive and balanced risk management strategy, which, among other things, relies on adaptive
and rolling hedging measures designed to limit our exposure to short- to mid-term fluctuations in the price of
pulp, exchange rates and energy prices, our ability to preserve cash in the mid-term through the adaptation of
the amount of our capital expenditures and a stable financing structure.

The measures taken have allowed us to successfully navigate the significant economic challenges imposed on
us and our industry between 2020 to 2022, including labor shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, supply
chain disruptions resulting in record high price levels for pulp in Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine as
well as the resulting energy crisis with energy prices increasing as high as 15x higher than at the beginning of
2020. Despite these multiple market-driven crises within a short time period, we believe our performance
during such challenging times has helped us to further strengthen our long-standing reputation as a reliable,
innovative and transparent partner with enduring, strong and trusted relationships with our customers,
allowing us to become even more resilient. We successfully shortened contract cycles with our customers and
succeeded in implementing required price increases without losing business or trust. In addition, we
implemented further measures to reduce volatility, such as a rolling 18 months forecasting on a monthly basis
which is harmonized to the pricing strategy and broader sourcing of energy and materials. We also introduced
the function of a business resilience manager to proactively manage volatility by collaborating crossfunctionally across our Group. As a result, we believe we can adapt more quickly and more proactively to
changing price levels and seasonality (i.e. energy pricing during summer vs. winter periods). For additional
measures we plan to adopt as part of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 to guide our business within
potential future volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (“VUCA”) market environments, see also “—Our
_Strategy—Focus on Strong Profitability and Financial Resilience” and “—Our Strategy—Continuous Striving_
_for Efficiency through Cost and Technology Leadership”._

We believe that due to the positive impact of the various measures and developments described above, we have
emerged from the market-driven challenges of this multi-crisis period significantly stronger than before. While
the Russian invasion of Ukraine created very significant challenges for our business, both our sales and
EBITDA increased significantly from €1,205.9 million and €93.1 million, respectively, in 2021, to
€1,636.4 million and €145.6 million, respectively, in 2022. In the twelve-month period ended September 30,
2023, we reported sales and EBITDA of €1,865.1 million and €318.2 million, respectively. Our EBITDA
margin (i.e., EBITDA as a percentage of our total operating performance for the period) amounted to 17.0%
in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to 8.6% in the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2022 and 7.7% in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, reflecting our ability to


-----

pass-through cost increases to our customers with continued momentum. In addition, we had a free cash flow
(adjusted by ABS Program) of €200 million in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, while our
Net Debt was reduced to €503 million with a corresponding Net Debt Ratio of 1.6x as of September 30, 2023.

**_Experienced Management and Committed Family Shareholders_**

Our company was founded in 1948 by Paul Krengel, and even today, our Group continues to be 100% owned
by members of the Krengel family. We believe that the strong personal and financial commitment from our
family shareholders ensures prudent investment strategies, a focus on stability and long-term value generation.
Martin Krengel, in particular, has overseen the growth of the business through his role as our Chief Executive
Officer and has been involved in the business since 1985.

The strong personal and financial commitment of our family shareholders is augmented by a strong and
highly-experienced management team with extensive industry experience. In response to the increasing size
and complexity of the Group as well as the industry we are operating in, we have successfully structured our
organization in a matrix with clear business unit and functional responsibilities and have expanded both the
size of our Management Board and our highly experienced senior management team in recent years. Our
Chief Executive Officer Martin Krengel and our long-term Chief Financial Officer Ralph Dihlmann, who
has been with the Group since 2014, have been joined by Andreas Krengel as member of our management
board in 2021. With a degree in business economics and previously serving as our Chief Strategy Officer,
Andreas Krengel is now responsible as Chief Executive Officer for both our Professional business unit and
our recently set up new business unit “New Business Areas”. Andreas Krengel’s management role in our
Professional business unit, his appointment to our Management Board and his management positions in our
family shareholders’ holding entities serve the goal of securing our future as a successful family-owned
business into the next generation.

Also in 2021, the Management Board was joined by Harm Bergmann-Kramer. Having graduated in
engineering, Harm Bergmann-Kramer has held various international management positions across the paper
industry for 19 years prior to taking over responsibility as our Chief Operating Officer. The latest addition to
our Management Board has been Menno Oosterhoff who joined us in 2022. With a degree in business
administration, Menno Oosterhoff has 24 years of extensive sales experience across the international
consumer goods industry and assumed the role as Chief Executive Officer for our Consumer business unit.

**OUR STRATEGY**

We want to be recognized by our customers as the partner of choice for hygiene paper in Europe and become
the market leader in sustainability with a strong culture and a strong focus on performance in everything we
do. To achieve this goal, we developed our “Perform & Transform Strategy 2026”, which builds on the original
“Perform & Transform” strategy we developed for the period from 2020 until 2023.

The key elements of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026, as further described below, are (i) a focus on
strong profitability and financial resilience, (ii) a continuous striving for efficiency, through cost and
technology leadership, (iii) the goal to become the partner of choice for our customers for hygiene paper by
building on our reputation as a strong and reliable supplier and by differentiating ourselves as a “concept
supplier”, (iv) a strong commitment to sustainability, as well as (v) our efforts to promote employee
engagement and performance through the establishment of a “performance with care” culture across our
organization and by becoming the “best place to work” for our employees.

**_Focus on Strong Profitability and Financial Resilience_**

A key element of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 is our goal to achieve a high degree of financial
resilience and strategic flexibility through (i) improvements to our ability to monitor, manage and improve
our margins, (ii) development of digital management tools supporting fast and proactive analytics, resilience
management and increased adaptivity of our supply chain, and (iii) an increased focus on optimizing how we
fund our operations. In particular, we have been putting a higher focus on proactive resilience management
and on digitizing and consistently cascading our decision-making processes to enable us to actively shape and
guide our business within VUCA market environments. This includes investments in forward-looking
management and forecasting tools, adaptive pricing and hedging measures as well as adaptive supply chain
measures. To strengthen our resilience in VUCA environments, we are also investing into diversifying and
broadening our production, supply chain and raw materials footprint. We have taken various measures
intended to strengthen our resilience and stabilize our gross margins at adequate levels, including the
development and introduction of product innovations (see also “—Strong Commitment to Sustainability”
below), efforts to differentiate and position ourselves as a “concept supplier” (see also “—Partner of Choice


-----

_for our Customers” below), the continuous development and improvement of our balanced risk management_
strategy and the introduction of more sophisticated contract and pricing structures that are better suited to
VUCA environments. On a case-by-case basis, this may include price balancing mechanisms and adaptive/
index pricing in longer-term agreements or the conclusion of shorter term, fixed price contracts. We have
introduced cash conversion as a key performance indicator to increase the awareness among our various
stakeholders of our cash generation capabilities, and we are also being more deliberate and proactive in
managing our inventories, treating working capital as an investment and inventory management as part of
our overall resilience management.

In all our decision-making, we recognize that a stable finance structure is critical to our long-term success.
This does not only include the ability to generate free cash flows sufficient to cover our regular maintenance
capital expenditures and other ongoing expenses, but also means that we must be able to further make
significant, controlled and “through-the-cycle” investments into long-term improvements of our regional,
technical and sustainability footprint. To ensure our continued ability to weather and/or adapt to future
VUCA environments (such as rapid and/or sustained increases in pulp, recycled paper or energy prices), we
plan to further enhance our proactive performance management, including requirements on more sustainable
margins based on expected input cost and additional services to ensure resilience, and to further enhance our
ability to preserve cash in the mid-term by adapting our discretionary capital expenditures.

Our focus on strong profitability will also cover measures related to our strategic portfolio management and
further efficiency improvements. We will continue to pursue our long-term strategy of gradually expanding
our customer base as well as our product portfolio and regional footprint as part of a continuous and
deliberate portfolio management process. Active portfolio management as (i) a continuous improvement
process, (ii) supplemented by customer-oriented innovations, (iii) supported by bolt-on acquisitions and
(iv) through regional organic growth has allowed us to significantly expand our business and to reduce our
dependence on any particular individual customers, products or regions, all while continuously working on
further efficiency improvements.

**_Continuous Striving for Efficiency through Cost and Technology Leadership_**

As our product offering mainly consists of commodity-like products, with market participants traditionally
focused primarily on price, a continuous focus on working efficiently and controlling costs (i.e. the ability to
continue to find ways to “do more with less”) has always been crucial to our ability to remain competitive and
to continue to operate in our industry. As part of the original Perform & Transform strategy we developed for
the strategic period from 2020 until 2023, we already set ourselves the goal to become the most efficient
company in the European tissue industry and initiated several related, group-wide initiatives. These include
initiatives aimed at achieving savings and efficiency improvements in the areas of fiber, energy and logistics.
With our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026, we continue to emphasize our goal to become the most efficient
and competitive company in our industry, through both cost and technology leadership, building on our
investments in our modern asset base over the last decade.

Building on a structure that we believe is already lean to begin with, we plan to continuously strive to achieve
cost leadership though additional efficiency improvements as part of our long-standing continuous
improvement program. As part of this program, we are executing numerous optimization initiatives in
different areas such as production, supply chain, sales, procurement and shared services. We further plan to
continue our other efficiency programs (such as our manufacturing excellence (“ManEx”) program) and
strategic operational programs (such as our Bluetec program). The aim of our long-standing ManEx program,
for example, is to continuously and sustainably improve our knowledge, our structures and our processes
within our organization by using benchmarking and by identifying and adopting best practices. We believe
there is still significant potential for us to “do more” with our existing asset base (including a potential
significant increase in the notional production capacity of our existing assets) through further standardization,
optimization and simplification of our production and manufacturing processes and a further simplification
of our product groups. With our “Bluetec”program, we aim to diversify our energy mix by increasing our use
of renewable energy (such as solar power, biomass and wind power) and to further reduce our reliance on
conventional sources of energy, in particular gas, thereby “future proofing” our business. For example, we
have already installed 2.9MW of solar capacity on the roofs of our facilities at our production sites in Salanetti,
Italy and Swalmen, the Netherlands, with plans to install additional solar capacity on the roofs of our facilities
at our production sites in Leuna, Müschede, Giershagen and Salanetti. However, in this regard, we also expect
to benefit from proposed future investments outside the Group by our Parent in complementary business
areas such as renewable energy, alternative fibers and circular economy business models, which we expect will
allow us to preserve capital and focus our own capital expenditures, efforts and other resources on further


-----

expanding and improving our asset base that is more directly related to our core tissue business. See also
“—Strong Commitment to Sustainability” and “Sustainability” below.

The second element of our drive for efficiency and competitiveness is technology leadership. This is because
we view technology leadership as a crucial enabler of efficiency-based cost leadership. We therefore not only
continuously strive to further optimize the capacity and the utilization of our paper machines and converting
lines as part of our ManEx program and other operational efficiency programs, but we also plan to continue
to improve and upgrade our asset base. In some cases, this may include replacing less efficient older equipment
with more efficient modern equipment, but we also have a dedicated program aimed at identifying and
implementing technology improvement projects (drawing either on our own internal resources and technical
expertise or working in tandem with external partners) in which we are either a first adopter of a particular
industry in our industry or even the inventor of new technology.

To achieve the full benefits of all these projects and initiatives, we believe it is crucial that we can deliver them
on time, on budget and on target, and we have therefore been putting a very strong emphasis on excellence in
project management and project execution and invested in enhanced project management and project
execution capabilities.

**_Partner of Choice for Our Customers_**

A further key element of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 is our goal to become the partner of choice
for our customers for hygiene paper by building on our reputation as a strong and reliable supplier and by
differentiating ourselves as a “concept supplier”. With competition in our markets traditionally focused
primarily on price, we have always viewed our ability to deliver our products at the right cost and with the
right level of service, quality and reliability as a basic, yet crucial requirement to be able to remain competitive
in our industry. We therefore strive to maintain and further strengthen our long-standing reputation as a
reliable, innovative and transparent partner with enduring, strong and trusted relationships with our
customers. In many cases, we are already fully embedded in the supply chains of our customers. We believe
our performance and reliability throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and periods marked by extreme energy
price peaks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at times forced certain other market participants
to reduce or suspend product deliveries, has further strengthened our reputation. We also believe that the
COVID-19 pandemic and recent market volatility have led to an important shift in how we are perceived,
especially by our larger customers, i.e. not just as a (theoretically replaceable) supplier of commodity-like
products, but as a critical supply chain partner. Furthermore, we believe we are now the only remaining
company with a clear focus on the private label tissue market and with the scale, capabilities and pan-European
footprint necessary to be able to supply our larger customers across multiple markets.

Building on this reputation and market position, we have invested significant time, effort and other resources
in recent years to move beyond the status of a mere supplier of tissue products. Specifically, one of our key
strategic goals for 2026 is to generate more than 50% of our sales, by volume, from costumers for which we act
as a “concept supplier”. As a “concept supplier”, we offer the relevant customers cross-functional
collaboration and to closely align our strategic plans with their strategic priorities, in particular in relation to
the introduction and development of new sustainable and/or innovative products, customer brands and
value-added services. In the first nine months of 2023, we generated approximately 15% of our sales, by
volume, from costumers for which we act as a “concept supplier”, and we believe that that the added value we
are providing as a “concept supplier” allows us and the relevant customers to generate both higher and more
stable margins in relation to such sales. We can offer the relevant customers unique and tailored solutions and,
in some cases have created and implemented joint business plans with individual customers. The relevant
customers can, but do not have to, opt into a range of additional, value-added services, including support
with product and packaging innovations, robust supply chain management and optimization, joint
forecasting, combined truck loading, category management, sustainability and circular solutions and tailored
price balancing mechanisms and adaptive/index pricing in longer-term agreements. For example, we can offer
customers of our Professional business unit that want to be able to offer their customers sustainable tissue
solutions our own range of sustainable brands as well as product innovations, and we collaborate with our
customers on circular solutions such as hand towel return services. At the same time, there is an increasing
recognition among many of our customers that the only way they can meet their self-imposed sustainability
goals is to collaborate with more sophisticated suppliers that can deliver the required improvements (e.g. with
regard to reduced CO2 footprints and/or increased recycling contents of particular products) in a way that is
“audit proof” and satisfies relevant third party verifiers. We have invested significantly in the relevant
value-adding capabilities, capabilities that many of our smaller competitors, in particular, and/or competitors
that are mere “converters” with no tissue paper production of their own simply lack. See also “—Strong
_Commitment to Sustainability” and “Sustainability” below._


-----

To be the partner of choice for our customers, we may further make additional investments to expand and
strengthen our regional footprint, either in the form of investment into new or expanded production facilities
or opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions. Following the consolidation amongst European retail groups, it has
become even more important that we can supply our customers across their respective markets. We want to be
able to offer our customers bespoke concepts for their own brands in all markets in which they operate,
including bespoke specifications, qualities and price mechanisms. We therefore continue to carefully assess
potential bolt-on acquisitions from time to time, not only to be able to match the pan-European footprints of
our customers, but also to potentially acquire attractive customer bases, to further broaden our portfolio
and/or to leverage our asset base.

**_Strong Commitment to Sustainability_**

We believe we are already an innovation leader with our long-standing focus on sustainable products and
production. See also “Our Strengths—Innovation Leader with a Long-standing Focus on Sustainable Products
_and Production”above and “Sustainability”below. Our strong commitment to sustainability, our aspiration to_
act sustainably in everything we do and our goal to be the most sustainable tissue producer are therefore
further key elements of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026.

We believe that sustainability is part of our DNA and that our authentic and genuine approach to
sustainability, based on decades of innovation leadership, in particular with regard to recycled and hybrid
tissue products, will serve us well as a key differentiator from many of our competitors. In order to build on
this key strength, we developed our “4+1 Strategy”which defines our sustainability goals in four distinct areas
into which we have divided our sustainability efforts: (i) future fibers, (ii) sustainable production,
(iii) sustainable products and (iv) portfolio extension through innovation. The guiding principle for all of
these goals and for how we want to operate as a business is a strong value foundation (i.e. the “+1”in our “4+1
Strategy”) that encourages responsible conduct as an employer, social commitment, compliance and product
safety.

_Future fibers._ We have long been convinced that recycled paper is the most sensible raw material, from a
sustainability perspective, for tissue products because (i) recycled tissue products have a significantly lower
ecological footprint than comparable pure pulp tissue products, and (ii) the fiber used in the production of
tissue products, in most cases, is irretrievably lost after the use of the product. At the same time, our
technologically advanced production capabilities allow us to produce recycled and hybrid tissue products of a
quality and brightness that is comparable to that of tissue products produced with virgin pulp. However, in
part due to digitalization and a change in working patters, high-quality recovered paper grades, such as office
paper, are becoming increasingly scarce in the market. We are therefore investing significantly in new
technologies, new processes and innovative products that use lower grades of recovered paper, such as OCC.
In addition, we have been investing into alternative virgin fibers (i.e. alternatives to wood-based virgin fibers)
for tissue such as fibers from miscanthus grass cultivated in Europe on fallow land. These alternative types of
fibers not only have significantly improved ecological footprints compared to pulp, but they also help us
diversify our fiber mix. Our ultimate goal is to create a fiber portfolio which addresses a broad range of
sustainability requirements, such as CO2 reduction, biodiversity, land use, waste avoidance and reduced
transportation requirements. In 2022, for example, we launched two new fiber innovations: (i) Black Satino
GreenGrow, a miscanthus-based tissue paper, and (ii) our Satino PureSoft Sortiment, based on OCC-based
tissue paper. According to the German Federal Environmental Agency, the OCC-based tissue paper
constitutes the biggest innovation in the paper segment in the last decade.

_Sustainable production and operational efficiency._ With regard to operational efficiency, we plan to
significantly reduce our CO2 and water footprint and to follow a zero-waste approach, with the goal to become
CO2 neutral by 2040. We strive to reach CO2 neutrality with a balanced mix of investments into our own
sustainable energy production, such as solar, wind and biogas, as well as through relevant power purchase
agreements with third parties, which may include power purchase agreement with our Parent or other affiliates
as described below. Our climate targets are flanked by continuous efficiency improvements and the increasing
use of renewable energy. See also “—Continuous Striving for Efficiency through Cost and Technology
_Leadership” above._

_Sustainable hygiene paper portfolio._ Regarding our goal to offer the most sustainable hygiene paper portfolio,
we have evaluated our hygiene paper portfolio based different sustainability criteria. We plan to use the results
of this evaluation to identify options for the sustainable further development of our portfolio, and to
transparently communicate with customers on how to make their product range more environmentally
friendly. These efforts also include innovative packaging solutions. Among other things, we have set ourselves


-----

a target to use recycled material for 60% of our packaging material by 2025 and save 8,000 tons of primary
plastics in our packaging every year.

_Portfolio extension through innovation._ We are expanding our existing product portfolio with the goal of
leadership in sustainable hygiene solutions in Europe. We believe that only ecologically and socially sustainable
innovations and business models allow for robust economic profitability in the long-term. We are therefore
committed to sustainability in the expansion of our product portfolio and in the area of research and
development. In 2022, we introduced a mandatory sustainability assessment for all our investments. This
assessment takes into account the environmental and social added value for society and for our company, and
includes an analysis of potential environmental, social and governance risks.

To meet our sustainability goals, including environmental protection, fiber diversification, increased
competitiveness, regulatory compliance, and to take advantage of sustainable growth opportunities, we further
plan to develop an investment roadmap to identify how we can “future proof” our business, for example, by
(i) increasing our use of renewable energy and reducing our reliance on conventional sources of energy, in
particular gas, (ii) improving and securing our access to “future fibers” and/or (iii) by further integrating
circular economy aspects into our production processes and product life cycles. See also “—Continuous
_Striving for Efficiency through Cost and Technology Leadership” above. In this regard, we expect to benefit_
from proposed future investments outside the Group by our Parent in complementary business areas such as
renewable energy, alternative fibers and circular economy business models. As these activities and business
areas mostly fall outside our core expertise as a tissue producer and involve different skill sets, expertise,
funding models and investment horizons, developing and/or integrating them into our organization would
potentially create significant challenges and might therefore distract us from our core business. We may
therefore conclude that it is preferable for all our stakeholders that any potential significant future investments
in those areas to be make outside the Group by our Parent or other affiliates. This approach would allow us to
potentially gain contractual exposure (e.g. via power purchase agreements) and preferential access (albeit only
through related party agreements on an arm’s length basis) to these important complementary business areas,
while allowing us to preserve capital and focus our own capital expenditures, efforts and other resources on
further expanding and improving our asset base that is more directly related to our core tissue business. As
part of such an approach, we may conclude that it is in the best interest of the Group to sell (on arm’s length
terms) WEPA Greenfield S.A.S. and its dry de-inked pulp production site in Château-Thierry, France to our
Parent. Acquired in March 2019 in an opportunistic transaction, our de-inked pulp production in ChâteauThierry is not integrated into any of our tissue paper production sites and our only business that relies on
third party sales of semi-finished products. A sale to our Parent or another affiliate might therefore allow us to
free up capital to reinvest into our core business, while preserving preferential access to the de-inked pulp
produced at the site.

**_Establish our Performance with Care Culture and Offering the Best Place to Work_**

The final element of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 consists of our efforts to promote employee
engagement and performance through the establishment of a “performance with care” culture across our
organization and by becoming the “best place to work”for our employees. We believe that we can only achieve
our other strategic goals if our employees across our organization work focused and with passion and take
ownership of their decisions and actions. As a family-owned company, we are highly committed to enable and
challenge our people with care. While the “performance” element remains key to our overall success and our
strategic goals, we also believe that caring for our employees is crucial to our continued success. We want to
facilitate high operating performance while fostering a care culture, including through the use of professional
steering and management tools. We believe that the tools we have implemented will help our employees to
prioritize, help us to build teams based on the strength of individuals and support life-long learning. Through
our WEPA Academy we aim to provide a platform that ensures that each employee gets the opportunity to
gain the skills necessary to master his/her role and to deliver on his/her goals.

The success of our business depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified management
personnel and skilled workers in the long term. We compete with a large number of other companies when
recruiting qualified employees. In all Western European markets in which we operate, there is an increasing
shortage of qualified personnel, especially workers with technical or engineering skills. As part of the “Best
Place to Work” element of our strategy, we aim to tackle these challenges by creating an attractive working
environment. This leveraging the potential benefits of digitalization in supporting our employees in their
personal learning and growth. In particular, we aim to offer interesting and purposeful work to our employees,
build learning and development into our daily work routines and to make our employees engage and identify
with our Group’s mission. We believe that this approach is yielding tangible benefits for our business. For
example, encouraging and enabling our employees to “upskill”, work in different positions and/or learn to


-----

operate different equipment may not only make work more interesting and improve job satisfaction, but may
give us more flexibility to deploy those employees in different areas of our organization in response to changes
in our operations, to cover absences by other employees or for other reasons. By capitalizing on the potential
benefits of digitalization, we want to create a workplace that provides our employees with a level of flexibility
to choose where and how they do their work. We also want for our employees to be supported, not replaced,
by digitalization and developments in the area of artificial intelligence.

**THE REFINANCING AND THE TRANSACTIONS**

The “Refinancing”refers to the issuance of €250 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes pursuant to
the Offering and the use of a portion of the proceeds from the Offering (i) to redeem in full the Existing
Floating Rate Notes on or about, 2024, and (ii) to pay other costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Refinancing, including underwriting fees and commissions, commitment, placement,
financial advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees. The Offering and the use of proceeds
therefrom, including the Refinancing, the financing of a portion of the purchase price we paid for the UK
Acquisition, and the proposed declaration and payment of an extraordinary cash dividend of €20 million to
our Parent on or around, 2024 are collectively referred to as the “Transactions”.

You should read “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness” for a more
detailed description of the expected use of proceeds and our capitalization and financing arrangements
following the completion of the Transactions.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

On January 10, 2024, we acquired all shares in Star Tissue UK Ltd. (now: Wepa Professional UK Ltd.), a
tissue paper converting and distribution company located in the United Kingdom (the “UK Acquisition”).
With a tissue paper converting capacity of 27,000 tons p.a. and approximately 130 employees, the UK
Acquisition serves to strengthen our Professional business in the United Kingdom. We also believe that it will
allow us to generate synergies with our paper production sites. We understand that in the twelve-month period
ended September 30, 2023, Wepa Professional UK Ltd.’s EBITDA was a high single digit million euro amount
based on financial information provided by the seller. As a result, the UK Acquisition is broadly leverage
neutral. The purchase price we paid for the UK Acquisition was a low-to-mid-double digit million euro
amount. We have agreed with the seller to keep the exact purchase price confidential.

**TRADING UPDATE**

Based on management accounts, our total sales revenues decreased by approximately €9 million or 2.9%, from
approximately €313 million in the two-month period ended November 30, 2022 to approximately €304 million
in the two-month period ended November 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction of the
average sales prices for our finished products, following a strong decline in market prices of our main input
factors seen since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2022, especially for pulp, recovered paper, electricity
and gas. Sales volumes of our finished products increased by approximately 8,000 tons or 7.1%, from
approximately 119,000 tons in the two-month period ended November 30, 2022 to approximately 128,000
tons in the two-month period ended November 30, 2023, resulting from a structurally higher demand in both
our Consumer and Professional business units, while sales of semi-finished products increased by
approximately 7,000 tons or 78.5%, from approximately 9,000 tons in the two-month period ended
November 30, 2022 to approximately 16,000 tons in the two-month period ended November 30, 2023,
primarily due to the sale of our increased inventory of jumbo reels which we had set up as a hedge against
anticipated disruptions to production related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the possibility of
a gas embargo and gas shortages during the winter period of 2022. Our EBITDA in the two-month period
ended November 30, 2023 decreased by approximately €4 million or 7.9%, to approximately €52 million,
while our EBITDA margin continued to remain on a high level of 17.3% in the two-month period ended
November 30, 2023, compared to an EBITDA of approximately €56 million, or 17.1% EBITDA margin, in
the two-month period ended November 30, 2022. Without the €1.7 million in expenses we recorded in October
and November 2023 in connection with the Refinancing, our EBITDA in the two-month period ended
November 30, 2023 would have been approximately €53 million, a decrease of only 4.9% compared to our
EBITDA in the two-month period ended November 30, 2022. Our Free Cash Flow (adjusted for ABS
program) in the two-month period ended November 30, 2023 increased by €26 million, to approximately
€29 million, compared to a Free Cash Flow (adjusted for ABS program) of approximately €4 million in the
two-month period ended November 30, 2022. Our EBITDA and our EBITDA margin in the two-month
period ended November 30, 2023 confirmed the strong result levels seen in prior months, due to the only slow
decrease of sales prices for our products reflecting the lower price levels for input costs, our improved cost

efficiency, increased sales of higher-margin products such as our hybrid and sustainable fiber products and
our overall strengthened market position in the European tissue paper industry.

the subject of any procedures by our independent auditors or any other audit firm and no opinion nor any
other form of assurance is expressed with respect thereto. The foregoing financial information is inherently
subject to modification during the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023. The presented financial information is not representative for any three-month or any

**MARKET UPDATE**

While we had seen a decrease in market prices for pulp and recovered paper in Europe until the end of the
third quarter of 2023, pulp demand in China had already started to recover several months ago and local
paper industry had absorbed the suppliers’ price increases. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023,
the European pulp market appears to have entered a new cycle as well. By the end of November 2023, prices
for softwood pulp were approximately 4.5% higher than by the end of the third quarter of 2023, and prices for
hardwood pulp increased by approximately 15.7%, however remaining significantly below the market price
peaks seen in 2022. Recovered paper pricing remained overall stable at a relatively low level in both October
and November 2023, and prices for electricity and gas also continued to be generally stable, with some more
volatility.

                        - will rank at least equal in right of payment with all of such
Guarantor’s existing and future obligations that are not
subordinated in right of payment to the relevant Guarantee,

that do not secure the Guarantee of such Guarantor, to the
extent of the value of such property and assets securing such
indebtedness.

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will initially be secured by first ranking liens over shares of
or the partnership interests in the Issuer, each Guarantor (other than
Wepa Italia S.r.l.) and Wepa Deutschland Verwaltungs- GmbH, any
machinery and equipment and real property in Germany, certain
machinery and equipment in the United Kingdom as well as any
loans of the Parent against the Issuer as described in more detail
under “Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release of

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral, the Holders of the
Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after lenders
under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Cash
Management Liabilities and counterparties to Priority Hedging
Liabilities have been repaid in full.

The security interests over the Collateral or the enforcement thereof
will be subject to certain significant contractual and legal limitations
and subject to certain defenses under applicable law. Applicable law
may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be
properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions
which, in the case of some Collateral, may not be completed until
after the Issue Date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—
_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to_
_perfect security interests in the Collateral”. For more information on_
the security interests granted, see “Description of the Notes—
_General—Security; Release of Collateral” and for more information_
on potential limitations to the security interests, see “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests” and “Risk_
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the_
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may_
_be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit its validity and enforceability”._

The security interests may be released under certain circumstances.
See “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes—There_ _are_
_circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under_
_which the Collateral and the Guarantees may be released automatically,_
_without your consent or the consent of the Holders’ Representative”,_
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—General—Security;_ _Release_ _of_
_Collateral”._

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer will use the gross proceeds of the Notes as set forth in
“Use of Proceeds”.

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . .** The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after
January 15, 2027 at the redemption prices described under
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”.

At any time prior to January 15, 2027, the Issuer may redeem on any
one or more occasions all or part of the Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, plus the Applicable
Premium, as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption”._

At any time prior to January 15, 2027, the Issuer may on any one or
more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount


-----

of the Notes, using the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at a
redemption price equal to % of the principal amount of the
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the date of redemption; provided that at least 65% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains
outstanding after the redemption. See “Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption”._

**Additional Amounts; Tax**
**Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made
without withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes in
any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless required by law. Subject to
certain exceptions and limitations, if the Issuer or applicable
Guarantor or paying agent is required by law to withhold or deduct
such taxes with respect to a payment on any Note or Guarantee, the
Issuer or applicable Guarantor will pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amount received after such withholding or
deduction is not less than the amount that would have been received
in the absence of the withholding or deduction. See “Description of
_the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts”._

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction
become effective after the issuance of the Notes that would impose
withholding taxes on the payments on the Notes and would require
the Issuer to pay Additional Amounts (as defined in “Description of
_the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts”), the Issuer may redeem_
the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price
of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, to the date
of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Early Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons”._

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . .** If the Issuer experiences a change of control (as defined in the
Conditions of Issue), the Holders of the Notes will have the right to
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price
equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase.
See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders
_upon a Change of Control”._

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . .** The Conditions of Issue will limit, among other things, the ability of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to:

                        - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain
preferred stock;

                        - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make other
distributions;

                        - make certain other restricted payments or restricted investments;

                        - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

                        - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                        - impose restrictions on the ability of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to pay dividends;

                        - transfer or sell certain assets;

                        - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                        - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and


-----

                        - impair the security interests for the benefit of the Holders of the
Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we
achieve investment grade ratings. See “Description of the Notes—
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants”. Each of the covenants in the_
Conditions of Issue will be subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Covenants”.

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be,
registered under U.S. federal or state or any foreign securities laws
and are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. See
“Transfer Restrictions”. We are under no obligation to, nor do we
intend to, register the Notes in the United States.

**Absence of a Public Market for**
**the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be new securities for which there is no established
trading market. Although the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are
not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at
any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the
development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. Furthermore,
the Notes will not have registration rights under the U.S. Securities
Act.

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should consider
carefully all the information in this offering memorandum and, in
particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set forth in
the “Risk Factors”section before making a decision whether to invest
in the Notes.

**Listing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange
Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission
to deal in the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is no assurance that the Notes
will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such
permission to deal in the Notes will be granted, or that such listing
will be maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at
its sole option at any time, without the consent of the Holders or the
Holders’ Representative, de-list the Notes from any stock exchange
for the purposes of moving the listing of the Notes to another
recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be a
stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union). See
“Description of the Notes—Covenants—Maintenance of Listing”.

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, the Conditions of Issue, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility will be governed by German law. The security documents
will be governed by applicable local law.

**Original Issue Discount . . . . . . .** The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. The Notes will be considered to be issued with
original issue discount if the stated principal amount of the Notes
exceeds the issue price of the Notes (as determined for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) by an amount greater than or equal to a
statutorily defined de minimis amount. If the Notes are issued with
original issue discount, U.S. holders (as defined below under
“Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) will
be required to include original issue discount in gross income (as
ordinary income) generally on a constant yield to maturity basis in
advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is
attributable regardless of such holders’regular method of accounting

for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Please see “Taxation—Certain
_U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a further discussion._

**SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION**

The financial information contained in the following tables is derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and from the
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as well as from the accounting records and other internal documents of the Issuer. The
results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year or any future period.

In addition, this offering memorandum includes certain unaudited consolidated financial information for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023. This information was derived by adding our consolidated financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2022 derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
to our unaudited consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and
subtracting our unaudited consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

The consolidated financial statements and the other historical consolidated financial information presented
below have been prepared on the basis of German GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from
IFRS. For a discussion of significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Significant Differences_
_between German GAAP and IFRS”._

In this offering memorandum, we present certain non-GAAP measures and ratios, including gross profit,
EBITDA, EBITDA margin, EBIT, income/(loss) before tax, trade working capital, free cash flow, free cash
flow, free cash flow (adjusted for ABS Program) and pro forma data that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, German GAAP. Our management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP
measures is helpful to investors because these and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors,
security analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.
However, you should not construe these non-GAAP measures as an alternative to net income determined in
accordance with German GAAP or to cash flows from operations, investing activities or financing activities.
In addition, the non-GAAP measures and ratios, including gross profit, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, EBIT,
income/(loss) before tax, trade working capital, free cash flow, free cash flow, free cash flow (adjusted for ABS
Program) and pro forma data presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies. We also present below certain operating data which have not been derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements, but from other internal sources of the Issuer.

The following tables also set forth certain pro forma consolidated financial information, after giving effect to
the issuance of the Notes in this Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom. See “Use of

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes to be issued in the Offering involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other_
_information contained in this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors_
_before purchasing the Notes. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our margins and results_
_of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, which in turn could adversely_
_affect our ability to repay the Notes. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely_
_affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects. In any such case, we may not be able to pay_
_interest or principal on the Notes when due and you may lose all or part of your investment in the Notes._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See “Forward-_
_Looking Statements”._

**RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS**

**_If the cost of key raw materials and energy increases, we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to our_**
**_customers._**

We depend significantly on access to sufficient, reasonably-priced quantities of pulp and recovered paper,
which we use to manufacture our tissue products, and we are also a significant consumer of energy. The global
supply of our key raw materials is limited and both the prices of our key raw materials and the price of energy
have been volatile in recent years. For example, pulp is our largest and recovered paper our third largest
purchasing cost item, accounting for 34.8% and 9.4%, respectively, of our cost of materials in 2022. This
compares to 32.1% and 12.8%, respectively, of our cost of materials in 2021, and 36.3% and 10.8%,
respectively, of our cost of materials in 2020. During the same periods, our total cost of energy increased from
11.3% in 2020 to 16.3% in 2021 and 24.2% of our total cost of materials in 2022. The ongoing inflationary
surge and geopolitical uncertainty, partially due to the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and the emerging
military conflict in Israel and Gaza, may contribute to further drive market unpredictability in the future and
may increase the degree of volatility in the prices of our key raw materials and energy in the near future. For
example, as a result of the Russia invasion in Ukraine, energy prices reached multi-year highs and pulp prices
all-time highs in 2022. There can be no assurances that we will not face significant increased energy costs for,
or disruptions in energy supplies to, our sites in the future. Any interruption or shortage of energy supply, any
inability to pass through rising energy costs or any of the other risks described above could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our
obligations under the Notes

We may be subject to potential margin erosion in case we become unable to pass through costs in the future.
We may also become less competitive vis-à-vis our competitors based in geographies less impacted by the
increasing energy prices in Europe if we continue to increase prices. Our present and future hedging
arrangements may not be sufficient and the cost of any future hedging arrangements may increase our hedging
costs. Moreover, there can be no assurances that we will not face significant disruptions in energy supplies to,
our sites. Our customers may also require us to decrease our prices should prices of raw materials decrease.

The majority of our supplier contracts for the purchase of key raw materials extends for terms of up to one
year with prices linked to indexes or subject to periodic negotiation while our energy is purchased partly
through long-term supply contracts entered into for terms of three years at the local level. Changes in the
terms of our energy or supply contracts, including any price increase, could adversely affect our earnings and
financial position because we may not be able to pass increases in the costs of key raw materials or energy on
to our customers in a timely manner or at all if the market or the relevant customer agreement do not allow us
to raise the prices of our finished products again. If price adjustments significantly trail the increase in raw
materials or energy expenses, or if we cannot effectively hedge against such cost increases, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

Our energy costs are dependent on the regulatory framework for the electricity sector, which is subject to
constant change and, in addition, we may face material cost increases if we lose certain financial privileges
which we benefit from in Germany with regard to the Energy Saving Act (Energieeinsparungsgesetz “EnFG”),
the Electricity Grid User Charge Ordinance (Stromnetzentgeldverordnung “StromNEV”), the Electricity Tax
Act (Stromsteuergesetz “StromStG”) and the Energy Duty Act (Energiesteuergesetz “EnergieStG”) surcharge
and network access fees and other fees.


-----

In addition to general market dynamics, our energy costs are influenced by the relevant regulatory framework
for the electricity sector both from the European Union and from national governments. See also “—We are
_subject to environmental and other regulatory requirements which may change, resulting in additional costs”. In_
recent years, this regulatory framework has been subject to substantial change and it will continue to be
subject to change in the future. Such change is not only due to legislative reforms, but is also prompted by
administrative and judicial decisions.

For example, in the context of emission trading, the EU and Germany have each adopted far-reaching
measures reduce the availability of CO2 emissions certificates in the current trading period (2021–2030). See
also “Business—Climate Change and Emission Trading”. This could lead to a significant increase in electricity
prices. To mitigate the impact of such resulting significant increases in electricity prices for “energy-intensive
enterprises”, the German government adopted rules that provided for various businesses, including us, to be
reimbursed for certain infrastructure investment surcharges necessary for the implementation of the so-called
“energy revolution” (Energiewende). However, such rules have not only been subject to challenges in the
German courts and to EU scrutiny as potentially illegal subsidies, but also continue to be subject to political
scrutiny by various interest groups as well as environmental movements. There is no certainty that we will
continue to be able to benefit from applicable accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund
schemes. For our sites in Germany, the relevant reimbursements for electricity and energy tax amounted to
more than €10 million in 2022 in total. In the other countries where we operate production sites, such
reimbursements are on comparable levels. If we experience any of these energy related risks, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

The governments of other countries in which we operate production facilities, or may operate production
facilities in the future, may adopt similar policies in order to promote the usage of renewable energy sources.
As a consequence thereof, the energy price could increase and there can be no guarantee that we will be
reimbursed to the extent to which the price increased, to the same extent as currently in Germany or even at
all. This could consequently adversely affect the revenue of our production facility and may force us to adopt
capital-intensive countering measures.

**_We may be adversely affected by uncertainty and/or unfavorable economic and/or political conditions._**

Our business may be negatively affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general
macroeconomic conditions, volatility in the global capital and credit markets, including in the European
sovereign debt market, the outbreak of severe communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, geopolitical events
such as the Russian invasion in Ukraine and the emerging military conflict in Israel and Gaza, and other
general political and economic developments globally and in the markets in which we operate.

Our results of operations in both 2020 and 2021 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,
which led to significant volatility of sales in both our Consumer and Professionals business units. At the start
of the Covid-19 pandemic in March and April 2020, panic buying of toilet paper and other hygienic articles
by end-consumers occurred across Europe and, in particular, in our primary market in Germany. In addition
to such unprecedented volatility of our sales and changes in shopping behavior during 2020 and 2021, the
COVID-19 pandemic also created a number of other challenges for the Group. First and foremost, we had to
ensure the health and safety of our employees, while also meeting our delivery commitments to our customers.
In line with significant fluctuations in the COVID-19 infections in the general population, varying infection
levels among our employees inevitably led to significant staff absences which created logistical challenges.

With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic slowly receding during the course of 2022, the Russian war
against Ukraine has created, or exacerbated, significant challenges for our business and has therefore had,
and continues to have, a material impact on our results of operations. Steep further increases in energy prices,
fears of gas supply shortages and general supply shortages posed major challenges for Europe, with the tissue
industry, as an energy-intensive sector, being particularly affected. In addition, sharply rising raw material
and transport prices as well as rising rates of inflation across Europe made significant, incremental price
increases for our finished and semi-finished products unavoidable during the course of 2022. In order to
hedge against anticipated disruptions to production related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the
possibility of a gas embargo and gas shortages during the winter period of 2022, we also took the decision to
reduce sales of semi-finished products to third parties to enable us to increase our inventory of jumbo reels,
reducing our sales to third parties by more than 10,000 tons in the financial year ended December 31, 2022
compared to the financial year ended December 31, 2021.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain,
and certain markets, including Europe, may not achieve the growth rates that they have forecasted or


-----

historically observed. Any of the foregoing developments (individually or in aggregate), or a perception that
any of these developments may be likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the economic
development of the affected countries or lead to economic recession or depression that could jeopardize the
stability of financial markets or the overall financial and monetary system. Any of these developments could
therefore have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations as
well as our ability to perform our obligation under the Notes.

**_Our results may be significantly affected by exchange rate fluctuations._**

Given the growing geographic spread of our operations, we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange
rate fluctuations. Poland and the United Kingdom, in particular, do not use the euro as their national currency.
As a result of our recent investments into a new paper machine and a new converting line at our production
site in Piechowice, Poland, as well as our investments into our newest paper machine in Bridgend, United
Kingdom, our exposure to both Polish zloty and British pounds has increased further. Considering the
expected growth rates of the British tissue market as well as the opportunities we plan to continue developing
and optimizing our operations at our Bridgend site, we expect our exposure in British pounds, in particular, to
gradually increase over the coming years. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Exposure to Exchange_
_Rate Fluctuations” below. In addition, we currently finance several of our foreign subsidiaries, including our_
Polish subsidiary Wepa Piechowice Sp. z o.o., through borrowings in euro. Further, all of the sales of Wepa
UK Ltd are derived from sales in British pounds, and earnings from Wepa UK Ltd contributed €30.2 million
to our reported EBITDA in the nine months period ended September 30, 2023.

We currently do not hedge our exposure related to the Polish zloty or British pounds-denominated intragroup loans to our Polish and UK subsidiary, respectively. Even if we do take further hedging measures in the
future, there can be no guarantee that such measures will be effective. As a result, fluctuations in the value of
the Polish zloty, the British pound or other local currencies against the euro have had, and may increasingly
have in the future, a significant effect on the relative competitive position of our production facilities, our
operations and on our reported results in euro, and the comparability of our performance between financial
periods can be significantly affected by fluctuations in local currencies against the euro.

In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar can also have a significant
impact on our profitability. While the prices of some of our raw materials such as pulp and oil (which affect
our energy costs, freight costs and auxiliary costs such as packaging materials) are quoted in U.S. dollars in
international markets, we primarily generate our sales revenues in euros. Therefore, a strengthening of the
U.S. dollar against the euro generally has a negative impact on our results.

Assuming a hypothetical pulp price of U.S.$600 per ton and an exchange rate of U.S.$1.10 per €1.00, a
fluctuation in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and the euro by U.S.$0.01 would result in a price increase or
decrease of approximately €4.96 per ton of pulp. Given that we consumed approximately 572,000 tons of
pulp in 2022, each U.S.$0.01 in exchange rate movement would have had an impact on our purchasing costs
for pulp of approximately €2.84 million, assuming we had not hedged our exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations.

**_Our use of hedging instruments might prove ineffective or expose us to additional risks, which may adversely_**
**_affect our financial position and operating results._**

We seek to hedge some of our exposure to increases in the price of pulp, increases in energy prices and
exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates through the use of various types of hedging
instruments, including forward contracts as well as other derivatives transactions such as interest rate, currency
and commodity swaps. Subject to the prevailing market conditions, we aim to hedge reasonable portions of
our projected pulp requirements for a certain period against price increases. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to correctly anticipate our full exposure to increases in the price of our pulp, increases in
energy prices and exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates in the future (which depends on
projected sales volumes in any given period, among other factors). Further, there can be no assurance that we
will or be able to hedge our full exposure or that our hedging transactions will be effective. The use of
derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those
associated with our ordinary business. Depending on the state and development of interest rates, exchange
rates or raw material prices, as applicable, our use of hedging transactions could harm our overall performance
compared to our competitors. In addition, we are also exposed to the risk of an insolvency or default of our
counterparties under our hedging transactions. Should one or more of these risks materialize, this could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

**_The availability of or any significant increase in the cost of freight and logistics services represents a significant_**
**_risk for our business._**

Freight and logistics services play an important part in our supply chain as we transport a majority of our
products, mainly by truck, to our customers. In addition, most of the raw materials that we use need to be
shipped to our production facilities and we regularly ship jumbo reels between our production sites. In the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, our freight and logistics costs amounted to 6.8% of our sales. Due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced limited availability of pallets and freight capacity in 2022.
Furthermore, in particular due to higher fuel prices, a shortage of drivers and increased demand, logistics
costs increased significantly from €111.5 million in 2021 to €127.0 million in 2022. Any additional increases in
fuel or energy prices, road tolls or demand driven market prices, including as a result of the military conflict
in Ukraine, resulting in higher freight costs, may have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, increased costs relating to vehicle emissions control
requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future, particularly due to climate change related
legislation, may also lead to such effects on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**_Increased pricing pressure and intense competition could have an adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, high levels of investment activities in the tissue industry had led to high
levels of competition for the utilization of newly invested facilities. While the investment activity in the tissue
industry has remained low since, we expect the activity level increase again in the future. Inherent risks in our
competitive strategy also include uncertainties concerning the effects of the ongoing consolidation and
growing presence of large-format retailers and discount retailers and the ongoing consolidation among tissue
producers in Europe. Our competitors include other low-cost manufacturers and rapidly-expanding
international manufacturers. In our Professional business unit, some of our products, in particular paper
towels, also compete with other types of products such as air dryers and cotton towels. Some of our
competitors may have greater access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which may enable
them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. Alternatively, some of our
competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, allowing them to
offer products at a lower cost. Further, although our market has experienced significant consolidation and the
exit of a number of key competitors, new competitors may enter the European tissue market and one or more
of our existing competitors may install additional tissue production or converting capacity or may reactivate
idle capacity. A significant increase in capacity in any of the markets where we operate could cause an
oversupply, resulting in lower market prices for our products, reduced capacity utilization rates and
consequential rise in our production costs and increased competition. This could in turn, adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, our competitive position in the various markets in which we operate is influenced by a variety of
factors, including:

- our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with our customers;

- the quality, breadth and innovation of our product range, and our ability to reduce production costs by
achieving high standards of efficiency and production;

- the flexibility and efficiency of our production processes;

- the efficiency of our distribution network;

- our ability to maintain plant efficiencies and high operating rates and thus lower our average

- manufacturing costs per ton;

- customer service and our ability to distribute our products on time;

- our ability to provide tailor-made or customized products;

- our ability to offer innovative new products;

- Political measures designed to limit the effects of climate change;

- brand identity and recognition in our Professional business; and

- the cost of energy and raw materials as well as the quality and availability of raw materials.

If we fail to compete effectively in our chosen markets, including through a failure to adapt to industry trends,
sustain the investments necessary to compete effectively, or properly manage our approach to the above
factors, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations.


-----

**_Increasing dependence on key customers and changes in the policies and purchasing behavior of those customers_**
**_may adversely affect our business._**

In our Consumer business unit, in particular, we generate a large percentage of our total sales revenue through
a few long-standing customers that we expect to play a key role in our long-term business success. Our five
largest customers accounted for 37% of our total sales revenue in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023 and our ten largest customers accounted for 53% of our total sales revenue in the same period. Due to
the ongoing consolidation among retailers, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, including largeformat retailers, who may have increasing bargaining power. Our key customers may use their bargaining
power to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could reduce our profitability. Our reliance on
certain key customers further exposes us to significant risk should any of these key customers experience
financial difficulties. If we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer
substantially decrease for any reason and if we are not able to substitute the lost business, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

We may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our key retail trade customers, such as
inventory de-stocking, de-listing of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental,
social and other sustainability issues, among other conditions. Our key customers could also choose to exit
from certain geographic markets or could lose market share to competitors, which could result in reduced
demand for our products by such customers and thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

In addition, the requirements and the demand habits of our customers may change and, as a result, we may
not be able to sell inventory which we produce in anticipation of future demand by a particular customer, or
we may only be able to sell inventory at reduced prices. The majority of our sales are conducted through
periodic tender processes. These tenders used to typically occur on an annual basis, but have occurred more
frequently following the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis. Depending on the relevant customer,
tenders may either cover all of our sales to the relevant customer or relate to individual products or product
categories or to particular geographic regions. If we are unable to successfully manage and complete these
tender processes, we could lose key customers or experience significant decreases in our sales volumes.

**_The agreements with our customers generally do not contain minimum purchase obligations, which leaves us_**
**_exposed to fluctuations in the demand behavior of our customers._**

We generally have framework agreements with our retailer customers which allow those customers to place
orders “on demand”and which generally do not contain minimum purchase obligations. There is an increasing
trend among retailers to strive to reduce working capital and procurement costs. If important customers
terminate or do not extend the term of their framework agreements with us or significantly reduce their
orders for our products compared to our internal sales forecasts, we may not be able to sell the relevant
products we have already produced to other customers on favorable terms or at all. This could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may fail to continue to realize further process optimizations, efficiency improvements and related costs savings_**
**_in connection with our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 and other programs._**

We may be unable to achieve the targeted improvements in operational efficiency, process optimization and
cost savings pursuant to our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 and other programs intended to improve
our profitability.

As we are unable to influence the market prices of our raw materials, energy prices or freight costs directly, our
competitiveness and long-term profitability are, to a significant degree, dependent upon our continued ability
to further optimize our processes, to generally improve our efficiency, to reduce costs (including the costs of
raw materials and other costs such as energy costs, freight and logistics costs and personnel expenses) and
portfolio management to optimize production cost (fiber, freight, local cost differences) and to maintain our
position as a leading, sustainability-focused, innovative and efficient tissue producer in Europe. Our
production costs are also significantly affected by production volumes and, therefore, our ability to maintain
production levels and optimally balancing capacity utilization with price levels will be a key factor in
determining our overall cost competitiveness. Our ability to maintain earnings and undertake capital
expenditure could be adversely affected in the event of a sustained material fall in prices for our products, an
appreciable rise in our production costs or a decline in our production volumes. A number of factors beyond
our control, such as operating disruptions, personnel turnover, competition, unforeseen delays in
implementing initiatives and general economic and industry conditions, governmental regulations for certain
types of our products (such as restrictions or limitations on so-called “single use products”) as well as future


-----

development on the commodity and energy markets, could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement
our strategy by limiting our ability to grow or our ability to reduce costs and increase efficiency, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not be successful in achieving cost savings, generating
growth and increasing our efficiency, cash flows and profitability. In order to be able to continue to realize
additional and sustained efficiency improvements through our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 as well as
other programs, we must continue to challenge ourselves and remain vigilant to avoid the risk of such
programs becoming “routine”.

If our ongoing efforts to improve our operational efficiency fail or the implementation of cost improvement
measures are not effective, sustainable or achievable, our competitive position may suffer. Additionally,
because we have factored the expected benefits of our process optimization and efficiency improvement
measures into our business plan, our failure to continue to realize further process optimizations and efficiency
improvements and to realize the related cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our margins and
results of operations and financial condition.

**_The success of our business relies on certain key personnel, and our ability to attract, develop and retain key_**
**_personnel, other qualified management personnel and skilled workers._**

The success of our business relies to a considerable extent on the efforts, abilities and reputation of our senior
management and key employees, including the members of our management board and our sales,
procurement and technical personnel. The loss of senior managers or other key personnel could significantly
disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations. Further, if
we lost any of our key personnel, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully find a suitable
replacement in a timely manner, or at all.

In addition, the success of our business depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified
management personnel and skilled workers in the long-term. We compete with a large number of other
companies when recruiting qualified employees. In all Western European markets in which we operate, there
is an increasing shortage of qualified personnel, especially workers with technical or engineering skills. If we
are unable to continue to attract and/or train qualified employees sufficiently and to retain those employees
within our Group, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

**_Our business could be adversely impacted by strikes and other labor disputes._**

There can be no assurance that our relationship with our employees and their unions does not deteriorate in
the future and we might experience strikes, unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions
or our employees. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, e.g. the Netherlands, we are subject to works council
participation by elected representatives, the interests of which may conflict with the overall interests of our
company or with the interest of holders of the Notes with respect to certain business decisions. In addition,
we may become party to labor disputes with certain of our employees. For example, the recent increase in
inflationary pressures in the general economy could lead to pay demands by employees that could lead to
labor unrest. Any production shortages and delivery interruptions of our customers resulting thereby or
conflicting interests of our works councils, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees
and their representatives, difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable employment regulations or
prolonged labor disputes, slowdowns, strikes or similar actions could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by increasing costs in maintaining our required level of workforce._**

During 2022, we had an average of 3,785 employees and personnel expenses constituted a significant
proportion of our cost base, increasing from €217.4 million in 2021 to €234.6 million in 2022. In 2023, we
experienced a further steep increase in labor costs compared to 2021 and 2022 due to renegotiated collective
bargaining agreements reflecting the higher inflationary pressures in the general economy. In addition, changes
in applicable laws and regulations or other factors resulting in increased labor costs, such as an increasing
shortage of qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations
and financial condition.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the risks we may face and if we were no longer covered_**
**_by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms or at all._**

Although we maintain insurance policies, including fire, explosion, radiation, electrical damage, machinery
breakdown, fuel or power shortages, third-party liability insurance, transport insurance, computer insurance


-----

and directors’ and officers’ insurance, not all risks are insured or insurable (and may have significant
deductibles on policies). Accordingly, our insurance policies do not provide coverage for all losses related to
our business, and the occurrence of losses, liabilities or damage not covered by such insurance policies could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, with regard
to the cyber attack we experienced in June 2022 (the “2022 Cyber Attack”), we did not have any cyber
insurance and our other insurance policies covered only a portion of the losses we incurred. Due to variable
insurance market conditions, there can be also no assurance that the insurance that we carry will continue to
be available, will be available at economically acceptable premiums or will be adequate to cover any resulting
liability, and we may be required to enforce insurance coverage or pay high deductibles. In some cases, coverage
is not available or is considered too expensive relative to the perceived risk. If we experience a loss in the
future, the proceeds of the applicable insurance policies, if any, may not be adequate to cover replacement
costs, lost sales, increased expenses and/or liabilities to third parties. This could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our operations require substantial capital, and we may not have adequate capital resources to satisfy all of our_**
**_cash requirements and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes may be impaired._**

Expansion or replacement of existing facilities or equipment and compliance with environmental, health and
safety laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures. For example, between January 1,
2020 and September 30, 2023, we have invested a total of €316 million in our business, including a total of
€224 million in 2 new paper machines at our production sites in Poland and UK and 11 new converting lines
for our plants in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK. We cannot assure you that our
capital resources will be sufficient for these purposes. If our capital resources are inadequate to provide for
our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, this shortfall could have a material
adverse effect on our business and liquidity and impact our ability to service our debt, including the Notes.

**_Our production facilities are exposed to operational risks in the form of service interruptions._**

We operate production sites in Germany, France, Poland, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
Critical production equipment at one or more production sites may fail or be required to be shut down as a
result, for example, explosions and fires, inclement weather and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, cyber
attacks, pandemics, wars and military crises, strikes, failure of mechanical, process safety and pollution control
equipment, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxins or hazardous substances or gases,
exposure to toxic chemicals and other industrial accidents, lack of energy and material disruptions in our
supply chain. This may lead to disruptions in production which we may not be able to absorb through our
other production sites or existing product inventories. This, in turn, may result in substantially increased
production costs or in delayed deliveries to our customers. It may also cause customers to seek other suppliers
if we are unable to manufacture sufficient volumes of products in time to meet our customer’s needs. For
example, after the 2022 Cyber Attack, we had to shut down our group-wide IT system for safety reasons and
recovery for 15 days before we restarted the main IT systems for core processes. We were unable to fully
operate our business and had to manage the production and supply of products to our customers using single
local IT systems at a significantly lower performance level, and consequently required a high workload to
update our IT systems after the end of the cyber attack. In addition, operating machinery and distributing
our products also carries the risk of industrial and workplace accidents which could cause injury or fatalities.
From time to time, there are accidents involving our employees and the employees of third parties in the
course of manufacturing and distribution of our products. In the event of an industrial accident, we may be
faced with claims for damages or public proceedings, which can be costly and time-consuming to defend.
Should we be found to be negligent, or the cover provided through insurance proves insufficient, we could be
held liable for the injury suffered. Any such incidents could also damage our reputation and lead to a loss of
customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

**_Adverse publicity may adversely affect our reputation._**

We may be subject to adverse publicity relating to, among other things, our product quality, environmental
impact (including energy and water use and waste management) and other sustainability or similar matters,
brands, customer complaints, production facilities and employee relationships. Adverse publicity may
negatively impact our reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid. For example, in light of
increased social and political awareness on sustainability, we may fail to adequately implement our short and
medium term sustainability goals within their allotted timelines. The negative impact of adverse publicity
relating to any of our products, brands or production facilities may extend far beyond the product, brand or


-----

facility involved to affect some or all of our other products, brands and facilities. Any such adverse publicity
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, through the increased use of social media, individuals and non-governmental organizations have
the ability to disseminate their opinions regarding our products, and our business, to an increasingly wide
audience at a faster pace. Any failure to effectively respond to any negative opinions or publicity in a timely
manner could harm our reputation, regardless of the validity of the statements against us, and ultimately
harm our business.

**_If we fail to respond to changes in customer requirements, our business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations may suffer._**

The preferences and requirements of our customers, as well as end consumers of our products, are
continuously evolving and can be difficult to predict. For example, our stakeholders and customers
increasingly expect us to use sustainable raw materials efficiently and decrease our CO2 emissions, which has
already led to product innovations in the past (such as sustainable hygiene products made from OCC and a
retrieval concept for towel papers) and may require further innovations and shifts in the future. If we fail to
keep pace with product development, to anticipate and meet consumer demand, our business, financial
condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. In recent years, we made significant investments
in product development and intend to continue to do so in the future. However, there can be no assurance that
the investments we have made in product development and technology will generate expected returns by
enabling us to increase or maintain market share. If we fail to maintain our current level of investments and
activities in research and development, or fail to generate expected returns on those investments, or volatile
governmental regulations negatively influence our development activities, this could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Potential compliance breaches could result in investigations by the relevant authorities, fines, damages claims_**
**_and the termination of supply agreements by customers._**

The Wepa Group consists of several separate entities in different jurisdictions, which all compete with
competitors for high-volume orders from our customers. This carries with it the risk that our employees may
engage in unauthorized conduct which breaches applicable legislation and regulations in order to gain an
advantage when competing for, and initiating, orders. Such behavior may lead to legal proceedings against us,
fines, sanctions, court orders affecting future conduct, forfeiture of profits, rescission of existing contracts,
exclusion from certain businesses, loss of trade licenses or other restrictions, which, in turn, might limit our
ability to pursue strategic projects that may be important for the business (e.g., joint ventures or other forms
of cooperation). Furthermore, actual or alleged corrupt behavior by us or our employees could harm our
reputation, lead to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on efforts to compete for new customer
business in both the public and private sectors. Such investigations could also have a negative impact on the
relationships with our existing customers upon which we depend, as well as on our ability to find new
customers. Any investigations could lead to the rescission of certain existing contracts, and third parties,
including competitors, could initiate legal proceedings against us. Any such past or future compliance breaches
could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_We are subject to various strict and evolving governmental regulations, laws and standards including_**
**_environmental, health and safety protection, sanctions and antitrust._**

Our operations and properties, as well as our products, are subject to extensive international, national,
provincial and local laws, regulations and standards affecting our business, including environmental, health
and safety protection, sanctions and anti-trust. These laws, regulations and standards govern, among other
things: emissions of air pollutants, waste management and disposal, noise pollution, product safety, workplace
health and safety, the storage, handling, treatment and disposal of regulated materials and the remediation of
contaminated land, water and buildings. The scope of these laws, regulations and standards varies across the
different countries in which we operate. For example, we require numerous environmental, health and safety
permits issued by regulators to conduct our operations. Failure to comply with these permits, laws and
regulations, or to obtain and maintain the required permits for either existing or future business operations,
could subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions and liabilities, including fines and penalties, as
well as operational constraints or mandatory shutdowns by applicable regulatory authorities.

Furthermore, we require various licenses and permits typical for manufacturers and operators of production
facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as permits under the German Federal Emission Control
Act (Bundes-Immisionsschutzgesetz) and the German Federal Water Management Act


-----

(Wasserhaushaltsgesetz). These licenses and permits are generally subject to a variety of conditions that are
stipulated either within the licenses and permits themselves, or under the applicable legislation or regulations
governing the issuing authorities. The continuation of these licenses and permits may be subject to annual
examinations or random inspections by the relevant authorities to ensure that our premises and operations
comply with all relevant regulations. Failure to comply with these and other regulatory changes or changes in
the law may result in existing or future licenses and authorizations being withdrawn or not granted in the
future. Moreover, any breach or material noncompliance with the regulations of the issuing authorities could
harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Due to the international scope of our operations, we, our partners and competitors must comply with certain
anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar regulations. For example, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010,
European Anti-Bribery Conventions and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of
obtaining or retaining business. Any breach or material noncompliance with such regulations could harm our
reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are also subject to a variety of antitrust and similar legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In
Germany as well as in some of our other markets, we have a market position that may make potential future
acquisitions difficult and may limit our ability to expand by acquisition or merger, if we wished to do so. In
addition, we are subject to legislation in all the jurisdictions in which we operate relating to unfair competitive
practices and similar behavior, both on an EU level and on a national level. There can be no assurance that we
will not be subject to allegations of, or regulatory investigations or proceedings into, such practices or behavior.
In the event that such allegations are made or investigations or proceedings are initiated (irrespective of merit),
we may be required to devote significant management resources to our defense against such allegations. In the
event that such allegations are proved, we may be subject to significant fines, damages awards and other
expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_We are exposed to the particular risks related to our increasingly international operations._**

Our operations have become increasingly international. In addition to our home market, Germany, we
currently operate facilities in France, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. As a result, we
are vulnerable to risks in these countries and to the particular risks inherent in international operations,
including

- increased difficulties in the collection of accounts receivable, including longer collection periods;

- inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in legislation or regulatory requirements (including
with regard to pandemics) and increased difficulty and expense in hiring and dismissing employees; work
stoppages, transport interruptions and difficulties in managing international operations;

- adverse tax consequences, including as a result of complex transfer pricing regulations;

- adverse currency fluctuations or restrictions on the transfer of cash;

- reimbursement rates and services covered by government reimbursement programs;

- exposure to local economic and social conditions, including logistical and communication challenges;

- exposure to volatility in the global banking sector; and

- exposure to local political conditions, including political disputes, requirements to expend a portion of
funds locally, increased risk of fraud and political corruption, or similar events.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations due
to the related delays or increased costs in the production and delivery of products and services.

**_We are subject to risks from legal proceedings._**

From time to time, we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business and could become involved
in additional legal and arbitration disputes in the future, including but not limited to contractual disputes,
debt collection proceedings, intellectual property disputes, and employee disputes. Proceedings may involve
substantial claims for damages or other payments. The outcome of proceedings is difficult to predict with any
certainty. In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal or arbitration proceeding, whether based
on a judgment, award or a settlement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments. In addition, costs


-----

related to litigation and arbitration proceedings may be significant. If any of these risks materialize, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

**_There is a risk that we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties._**

It is not always possible to determine with certainty whether there are effective and enforceable third party
intellectual property rights to certain processes, methods or applications. Therefore, third parties could assert
infringement claims (including illegitimate ones) against us. As a result, we could be required to cease
manufacturing certain products or be forced to make changes to products. In addition, we could be liable to
pay compensation for infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses to make use of technology from
third parties. This could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law._**

Our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient to prevent or detect inadequate practices,
fraud and violations of law by our intermediaries and employees. Due to our business operations in multiple
countries in Europe, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations in various countries. These include,
among others, regulations concerning competition and antitrust law, international trade and customs,
licensing and permits, commercial intellectual property and its enforcement, warranty and product liability,
environmental, building and zoning law, energy law, hazardous substances and chemicals law, labor and work
protection law, tax law and regulations related to purchasing and acquisitions.

In the event that any intermediaries, consultants, sales agents or employees with whom we cooperate either
receive or grant inappropriate benefits or generally use corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair business practices,
we could be confronted with legal sanctions, penalties and loss of orders and harm to our reputation.
Especially given our increasingly international profile, the size and the extent of our cooperation with
intermediaries, consultants, sales agents and employees, our internal controls and procedures, policies and
our risk management may not be adequate to identify or prevent such practices, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

**_The operational and strategic management of our business relies on complex information technology. As a result,_**
**_any IT systems failure, unauthorized data access, data loss or data manipulation could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business._**

The operational and strategic management of our business relies on complex information technology and the
uninterrupted operation of complex and sophisticated computer, telecommunication, cyber-security and data
processing systems. Computer and data processing systems and related information technology infrastructure
(data center, hardware and wide and local area networks) are generally exposed to the risk of disturbances,
damage, electricity failures, computer viruses, fire, other disasters, hacker attacks, unauthorized or improper
access or abuse by employees and similar events.

Disruptions to, or interruptions in, operations involving these systems have occurred in the past and may
occur in the future. For example, the 2022 Cyber Attack significantly impacted the availability of our groupwide IT systems. We had to shut down our group-wide IT system for safety and recovery for 15 days before we
were again able to restart the main IT systems for core processes. During the shutdown, the production and
supply of products to our customers could only be handled by using single local IT systems at significantly
lower performance levels. Cyber attacks such as the 2022 Cyber Attack, cyber-security threats and computer
crime, including the use of faked identities, pose a relevant risk to our business and the security of our
information technology systems, including those third party service providers with whom we have contracted,
as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. Disruptions to or
interruptions in operations can lead to production downtime which, in turn, can result in lost sales. Further,
breaches in our information technology security systems can result in relevant disclosure or misuse of
confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, supplier, employee or investor
information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. Any such event could cause damage to our
reputation, loss of valuable information, loss or revenue or financial situation and could result in large
expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems,
or to protect against similar future events.

**_A breach of data privacy regulations, in particular GDPR, may result in significant fines and penalties._**

In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data in our technology systems. This data
includes confidential information belonging to us, our customers and other business partners, as well as


-----

personally identifiable information of individuals, including our employees. Particularly within the European
Union, data protection legislation is comprehensive and complex and there has been a recent trend toward
more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection of personal data. The data protection
legislation (i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) obligates inter alia European Union-based
companies to comply with a large number of obligations. We work to continue to be fully compliant with our
obligations under the GDPR and have appointed a data protection officer who, among other things, advises
on our compliance obligations and assists us in ensuring that our software systems safely process personal
data, which mainly relates to our employees. However, non-compliance with the GDPR may result in
significant penalties, including fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever
is higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. In addition, to the GDPR, we are also subject to
other laws and regulations on privacy, information security and data protection, including the German Federal
Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz “BDSG”).

Non-compliance with any of these laws and regulations could occur through a result of human error, external
hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches, physical security
breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access or technical defects resulting in a leak or the
misuse of such data. It could result in damage to our reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to
correct the breaches of failures and otherwise harm our business. In addition, we do not have specific data
security insurance coverage and we cannot guarantee that our general liability insurance coverage will be
sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Should one or
more of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operation.

**_We may not be able to integrate acquired businesses effectively or successfully._**

To complement or expand our business, we have in the past made a number of acquisitions and we may
continue to make acquisitions in the future. For example, we acquired the de-inking business of Kübler &
Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH located on a property adjacent to our production site in
Kriebstein, Germany in June 2023 and all shares in Star Tissue UK Ltd. (now: Wepa Professional UK Ltd.).),
a tissue paper converting and distribution company located in the United Kingdom, in January 2024. See
“Business—History”. Management’s negotiation of potential acquisitions and joint-ventures and the
integration of acquired businesses require time, focus, and resources of management and of our employees.
When combining previously independent businesses, marketing systems and corporate cultures, problems
and risks may arise, including, among others:

- We may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business, and its different business models;

- we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with current technologies;

- we may not be able to retain key personnel of the acquired business;

- we may assume material unknown liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquired companies, including
legal, tax, intellectual property, environmental or other significant liabilities that may not be detected by
the due diligence process;

- we may have difficulty implementing, restoring, or maintaining internal controls, procedures, and
policies;

- there may be a negative impact on relationships with customers, partners, or third-party providers of
technology or products;

- integrating systems for customer care and billing and standardizing finance and accounting, purchasing,
human resource, and other administrative systems can be time-consuming and costly, and can cause
unforeseen difficulties;

- there may be regulatory constraints and new regulatory requirements such as those relating to climate
matters;

- the acquired business may have practices or policies that are incompatible with our compliance
requirements; and

- we may take on substantial additional indebtedness.

In addition, acquired businesses might not perform as anticipated, resulting in charges for the impairment of
goodwill and other intangible assets. Such charges may have a significant negative impact on operating


-----

margins and income. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks and we may therefore not benefit as
anticipated from acquisitions or alliances, which could negatively impact our business, financial position and
results of operations.

**_We are subject to environmental and other regulatory requirements which may change, resulting in additional_**
**_costs._**

We are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and other regulatory requirements, including with
regards to workplace health and safety requirements, discharges of pollutants and other emissions and the
use, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and contaminants. As an international producer of
tissue products with production sites in Germany, France, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands and the United
Kingdom, we are subject not only to German regulations, but also to applicable legal provisions in other
countries and the European Union. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenditures to ensure
continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and other regulatory requirements. These laws and
regulations are continually being adapted in line with technological advancements, increased safety
requirements, higher quality standards and environmental awareness, on both a national and an international
level. We may therefore be subject to increasingly strict regulatory requirements, especially to requirements
related to climate change, not at least as a result of the 2015 Paris Agreement. We fully support the EU Green
Deal, the European Union’s initiative to reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, and the need
to maintain safeguards against carbon leakage, which is at a risk of occurring if emission policies are not
consistently applied in our energy-intensive paper manufacturing process. However, the EU Green Deal could
increase government regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, putting further limits on our product operations.
This could affect our production costs and overall profitability. Furthermore, growing concerns regarding the
environmental impact of packaging have led and may continue to lead to the implementation of strict laws
and regulations aiming, among other things, at increasing the collection and recycling of packs reducing
packaging waste and litter and introducing specific packaging design requirements. For example, in
November 2022, the European Commission released a proposed revision of the Packaging and Packaging
Waste Directive (Directive 94/62/EC) with the aim to set strict requirements for packaging products and
achieve higher reuse and recycling rates by 2030. The European Commission’s proposal envisages key
measures such as minimum inclusion rates for recycled content in plastic packaging, restrictions on overpackaging, mandatory product reuse targets and common design criteria aimed at increasing recycling rates
across ranges of packaging products. A further recent legislative innovation is represented by the European
Union’s Deforestation Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115). This regulation, which came into force in
2023, requires businesses manufacturers of, among other things, certain wood-derived products, to conduct
extensive diligence on their supply chains in order to ensure that wood or wood derivates used in their
production processes have not been sourced from deforestation activities or from activities that amount to
breaches of local environmental laws. Environmental and health and safety regulations such as these ones as
well as future events, such as changes in laws and technology, the promulgation of new laws or the development
or the discovery of new facts or conditions could expose us to the risks of incurring substantial costs and
liabilities that.

If the costs of complying with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations continue to increase and
we are not successful in passing such additional costs, in whole or in part, onto our customers, any such
changes could have a negative impact on our profitability. Additionally, failure to comply with applicable
environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties
or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring
corrective measures, the installation of pollution control equipment or other mandated actions, including
regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, the
installation of pollution control equipment or other mandated actions. We also may be liable under certain
circumstances, among others, for contaminations of soil, water and air and may be required to take or pay for
remedial action. We expect that future changes to existing legal requirements or new regulations may affect
our business and could lead to higher costs, or may result in adjustments to our business model, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our own climate goals could adversely impact our business and our operating results._**

In addition to increasingly demanding environmental regulations, we have also defined our own goals as part
of a sustainability strategy. To progressively address the challenges of climate change, we have joined the
Science Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) and set ambitious climate targets. By 2030, we aim to reduce our
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 52.5% to make a measurable contribution to limiting global warming. In
addition, we aim to increase our energy efficiency by 10% over the same period of time and pursue the vision


-----

of becoming climate neutral by 2040. A comprehensive energy optimization program and numerous
investments in renewable energy supply concepts support these goals. However, such measures could—at least
temporarily—have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and
there can be no assurance that the investments we have already made and will make in the future will generate
returns.

**_Our business could be adversely impacted by climate risks and scarce resources._**

The climate risks relevant to our business can be divided into forest risks, water risks and energy risks. The
most significant risks influencing forests and thereby the availability of our most important raw material pulp
are the weakening of harvesting conditions as winters grow shorter and the increase of various kinds of
damage caused by insects as the climate grows warmer. Extreme weather phenomena, such as periods of
heavy rainfall or extreme heat and water scarcity, may also weaken the availability of the process water and
energy needed by our production sites or cause floodings, which in each case could result in disruptions to
production. Furthermore, we may experience a decline in the stability of power supply and a risk of grid
failures due to political measures to restructure energy systems. If we experience any of these climate related
risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely effected.

**_Economic events affecting the European economies may adversely affect our financial position and operating_**
**_results._**

In previous years, economic events affecting the European economies have raised a number of questions
regarding the overall stability of the European Monetary Union. Despite measures taken by countries in the
European Monetary Union and the European Central Bank to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist with
respect to the ability of certain European Monetary Union countries to meet future financial obligations, the
overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and
political circumstances in individual European Monetary Union member states. If the European Monetary
Union debt crisis was to be repeated, it is possible that one or more countries may default on their debt
obligations or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency. If such an event were to
occur, it is possible that there would be significant, extended and generalized market dislocation, which may
negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the departure of one
or more countries from the European Monetary Union may lead to the imposition of, among other things,
exchange rate control laws. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related
issues, could adversely affect our trading environment or the value of the Notes and could have adverse
consequences for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated and, because
we have a substantial amount of debt denominated in euro, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on outside suppliers and subcontractors and are therefore susceptible to disruptions in our supply chain._**

We rely on outside suppliers and subcontractors and their ability to deliver raw materials, products or services
at the right time and of the right quality. Our most important production inputs are pulp, recovered paper,
freight, energy and chemicals as well as machinery and equipment. For some of these inputs, we may not be
able to rely on an uninterrupted supply from our regular suppliers. Furthermore, we may encounter a shortage
or discontinuation of certain types of materials purchased from one or more of our suppliers. In the event of
a significant interruption or limitations in the supply of these production inputs from our current suppliers,
there can be no assurance that we would be able to find alternate suppliers or do so without adversely
impacting our manufacturing operations, such as an interruption or downscaling of production or change in
the product mix, or increased costs. For example, in 2022, one of our key suppliers of pulp experienced a
three-month long strike by its employees at one of its production sites, forcing us to partially source our pulp
from other sources at higher costs. A loss or interruption in the delivery of our key raw materials could lead to
a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to general counterparty risk._**

We have contracts with a variety of third parties including customers, suppliers and hedging counterparties.
We do not have control over the management or business of these third parties except indirectly through
terms we negotiate in our contracts with these third parties and we are exposed to risks associated with the
financial condition of these third parties. If any of these third parties experiences financial difficulties or
changes or terminates its contractual commitments to us, we may incur costs enforcing our contractual rights


-----

and we may incur significant losses from our exposure to third parties. This could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are family owned and conflicts of interest could arise between our company, our family owners and our_**
**_management._**

Members of the Krengel family control, directly or indirectly, the direction of our business. Both our chief
executive officer Martin Krengel and our board member Andreas Krengel are members of the Management
Board of our Parent, member of a shareholder family and managing director of the Issuer. All interests in
WEPA SE are ultimately owned by members of the Krengel family. The interests of WEPA SE or the interest
of its ultimate shareholders may conflict with the overall interests of our company or with the interest of
holders of the Notes with respect to certain business decisions, particularly if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due, including under the Notes. Our family shareholders could
also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or
other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investments although such transactions might
involve risks to the holders of the Notes. Also, our direct and indirect shareholders may have strategic
objectives or business interests that could conflict with our own strategies or interests. If the interests of our
direct or indirect shareholders conflict with our interests or the interests of the holders of the Notes, or if our
direct or indirect shareholders engage in activities or pursue strategic objectives that conflict with our interests
or the interest of the holders of the Notes, we and holders of the Notes could be disadvantaged.

**_Substantial additional payments of tax may be required as a result of ongoing or future tax audits._**

Both our German and our international operations are subject to periodic audits by tax authorities. If the tax
authorities successfully challenge our operations or tax structurings, substantial additional payments of tax
may be required as a result of future tax audits. For example, the ongoing tax audit in relation to our German
operations for the tax assessment period of 2015 to 2019 has so far resulted in an assumed additional tax
burden of €0.3 million. As the tax audit is still ongoing, a risk of further claims and additional payments
exists. Further, in particular the changes to our organization and a number of Group companies to streamline
the organizational structure and operations of our Group in 2015, the set-up of our UK operations in 2016
and 2018 and their subsequent legal streamlining, the reorganization of our German operations in 2021 and
the refinancing of our Group in 2016, 2019/2020 are still subject to review by the tax authorities. Any
additional payments of tax required as a result of ongoing or future tax audits could give rise to further
financing requirements, which have not been taken into account in our current liquidity planning. Thus, we
may be required to make substantial additional tax payments as outcome of future tax audits, which could
have material adverse effects on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_The international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure may expose us to potentially_**
**_adverse tax consequences._**

Due to the pan-European nature of our business, we are subject to tax laws in several jurisdictions. We are also
subject to transfer pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies pursuant
to, for example, purchase agreements or other arrangements. Adverse developments in these laws or
regulations, or any change in position by the relevant authority regarding the application, administration or
interpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, including changes in global minimum
taxation rules such as Pillar II, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In addition, there are many transactions and calculations in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain. The application of various domestic and international sales, use, occupancy,
value-added and other tax laws, rules and regulations is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing
authorities. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions
in which we operate. We cannot be sure that these interpretations are accurate or that the responsible taxing
authority is in agreement with our views. If the tax laws, rules and regulations are amended, if new adverse
laws, rules or regulations are adopted, or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests, the results
could increase our tax payments (prospectively or retrospectively) and/or subject us to penalties. For example,
the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives adopted by the EU Council on July 12, 2016 under Council Directive
(EU) 2016/1164 (ATAD I) and as amended by Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (ATAD II) may have an
adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Furthermore, on July 10, 2021 the G20 endorsed the “OECD/G20
Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” (“IF”) to address the tax challenges arising from
the digitalization of the economy, with the ambition to bring the new rules into force in 2023. As such, there
is broad political consensus for a substantial revision to global tax policy. As a result, these changes could


-----

decrease the capital we have available to operate our businesses and have an overall adverse effect on our
businesses and financial performance.

**_We may be affected by the German “interest ceiling” rules._**

Interest payments on the Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and on our other debt may not be
fully deductible for tax purposes, which could adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to so-called interest barrier rules (Zinsschranke), which impose certain restrictions on the
deductibility of interest for tax purposes. Since 2008, the German interest barrier rules in general have
disallowed the deduction of net interest expenses exceeding 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of
the interest barrier rules, all businesses belonging to the same tax group (Organschaft) for corporate income
and trade tax purposes, i.e., the Issuer and certain Guarantors, are treated as one single business. Such
consolidation is, inter alia, relevant for the calculation of the tax adjusted EBITDA.

There are certain exemptions from the restrictions of the German interest barrier rules allowing for a tax
deduction of the entire annual interest expenses, which, however, should not be available to the Issuer. To the
extent our net interest expenses exceed 30% of our tax adjusted EBITDA in any given year, we would therefore
not be able to deduct the excess in our net interest expense in calculating our taxable earnings for the relevant
year. This may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition and on our ability to meet our
obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The information available to market analysts varies in its degree of comparability._**

This offering memorandum contains information regarding market positions, market shares, growth rates
and other industry data pertaining to our business drawn from reports and other materials compiled by
independent professional organizations and analysts. This includes reports prepared by RISI and Hawkins
Wright. The analysts compiling these reports base their estimates and conclusions on a variety of sources,
some of which may be more comparable than others. These sources may include:

- official information published by government agencies,

- reports published by exchange listed companies with public reporting obligations,

- information offered voluntarily by privately held companies, and

- analysts’ own estimates based on information obtained in conversations with competitors, suppliers,
customers and other market participants.

Although our industry uses these reports as a standard source of market data, we cannot determine the level
of reliability and comparability of the data in the reports. The analysts’ estimates and conclusions can vary,
and have in the past varied, materially from the true figures and as a result their reports can under or overstate
market size, market share, growth rates and other important industry data. Accordingly, you should use
caution in using these estimates and any information regarding market position or shares contained in this
offering memorandum and you should not place undue reliance on such estimates or information.

**RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL POSITION**

**_We are subject to significant restrictive debt covenants under the Conditions of Issue, the conditions of Issue of_**
**_the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the financial debt, all of which_**
**_limit our operating flexibility._**

The Conditions of Issue, the conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility contain, or will contain, covenants significantly restricting our ability to, among
other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock,

- create or incur liens,

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity,

- make certain restricted payments and certain restricted investments,

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries,

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances
to, and on the disposal, transfer or lease of assets by subsidiaries,


-----

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries,

- consolidate or merge with other entities, and

- impair the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to
pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest. The Conditions of Issue will
permit us to incur unsecured as well as secured debt in the future, which may be substantial.

In addition, the conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility include covenants that, in general, impose similar, if not tighter, restrictions on the actions mentioned
above. In addition, the conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the covenants under the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility impose further restrictions on the way we can operate, including
restrictions on our ability to:

- purchase Notes in the secondary market;

- transfer the center of main interest of any obligor; and

- amend constitutional documents.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility also includes a “spring-in” leverage covenant, which requires us
not to exceed a certain consolidated net leverage (i) at any quarterly testing date during a time during which
the aggregate base currency amount of all utilizations of loans (including all utilizations under ancillary
facilities (excluding letters of credit other than to the extent issued for cash loans or similar instruments))
under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be greater than 50 per cent. of the total commitments
thereunder (the “Financial Covenant Condition”) or (ii) if a utilization has been requested at any time where
the Financial Covenant Condition is met or would be met by the proposed utilization. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility”. Our ability to meet these financial tests may be_
affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may not be able to meet these tests. Any breach of
the leverage covenant under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility could result in a draw-stop under the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and/or an acceleration of that facility, which in turn could, subject to
certain threshold amounts being reached, trigger a cross acceleration of the Notes.

As a result of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in the instruments discussed above or under any
other outstanding debt instruments, any breach of any covenant under those instruments could result in all
amounts outstanding under any such instrument being accelerated and becoming due and payable. We may
be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes”. Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants to which we are subject could limit our_
ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and
activities that may be in our interest.

Any future debt agreements that we enter into may have covenants that are even more restrictive. The
requirement that we comply with these and any future provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to
react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable,
obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, or withstand a continuing or future downturn in
our business.

**_If we are unable to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants included in the Super Senior Revolving_**
**_Credit Facility, the conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, the Conditions of Issue or any future_**
**_debt agreements, there could be a default under such agreements, which could result in an acceleration of_**
**_repayment._**

As described in the preceding risk factor, the Conditions of Issue, the conditions of issue of the Existing
Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility contain, and any future debt agreements we
enter into may contain, a number of financial and restrictive covenants. Our ability to comply with these
covenants, including meeting financial ratios and tests, depends on a number of factors, some of which may
be beyond our control, such as a deterioration of the industries and markets in which we operate or a deviation
from the assumptions contained in our business plan. As a result, we may be unable to comply with our
financial and restrictive covenants, and any failure may materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.


-----

The breach of a financial or other covenant or our failure to meet any of our obligations under any of the
agreements governing our debt may result in a default under such agreements, which in turn could result in a
number of adverse consequences including prohibiting us from drawing additional funds under credit
facilities, significant increases in interest rates and other financing costs, the acceleration of all outstanding
amounts under such agreements requiring us to immediately repay the related debt in whole or in part, and/or
the commencement of foreclosure or other enforcement actions against any of our assets securing such debt.
In addition, any default may expose us to requests by our suppliers for advance payments for deliveries and a
reduction or cancellation by credit insurers of their commitments. Defaults may also trigger cross-default and
cross-acceleration clauses contained in our other debt agreements, including the Conditions of Issue, the
conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, and our
liquid funds and short-term cash flow may be insufficient to service any of the debts in the circumstances
described above. If any of these events occur, we may be unable to obtain alternative debt or equity financing
to refinance our debt obligations, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt
obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, however, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full all of our
outstanding indebtedness. Accordingly, any failure by us to service our debts may have a materially adverse
effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

A breach of any of the covenants under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (which includes a “springin” leverage covenant for the benefit of the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) or the
occurrence of certain specified events will, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations, result in
an event of default under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of any event of
default under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Majority Lenders (being lenders under the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility whose commitments thereunder aggregate at least 66[2]∕3% of the total
commitments thereunder) could, while such event of default remains unremedied or unwaived, cancel the
availability of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable.

The conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes provide that, subject to applicable cure periods,
thresholds and other limitations, the occurrence of certain events constitutes an event of default. The
conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes further provide that holders of the Existing Fixed Rate
Notes representing at least 25% of the outstanding Existing Fixed Rate Notes may terminate and declare the
Existing Fixed Rate Notes immediately payable following the occurrence of an event of default which has not
been remedied or waived. In addition, a default or event of default under the Existing Fixed Rate Notes or the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt
instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Conditions of Issue.

If our creditors, including the creditors under the Existing Fixed Rate Notes or the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of amounts owing to them under such other debt instruments, there
can be no assurance that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay those
amounts in full, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make
payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those
amounts, our creditors could proceed against any security interests granted to them to secure repayment of
those amounts.

**_Our substantial leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our business._**

We are, and expect to continue to be, highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations” and “Summary Financial Information and other Information”. As of September 30,_
2023, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom, as described
under “Use of Proceeds,” we would have had total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness of
€601.7 million (excluding our ABS Program which is off-balance sheet), resulting in a consolidated debt to
EBITDA ratio of 1.6x. In addition, we would have had the ability to borrow an additional €145.7 million
under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (less the €4.3 million in payment guarantees pursuant to an
ancillary facility). See “Capitalization”.

- Our significant leverage could have important consequences to the Holders, including:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, changes in our business and
the competitive environment, the industry in which we operate and general adverse economic and
industry conditions;


-----

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, or
other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate as well as our flexibility to maximize business
opportunities;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- exposing us to increases in interest rates to the extent any of our debt bears interest at a floating rate, such
as the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;
and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business
opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future
borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

Furthermore, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility and the conditions of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes contain, and the Conditions of
Issue will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the restrictions are subject to a
number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of
indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent
we become even more leveraged or incur additional obligations, the risks described above will intensify.

**_Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may_**
**_make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

The terms of the Conditions of Issue allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness—Limitation on Indebtedness”. Certain of such additional indebtedness that we may_
incur in the future, including, for example, any additional indebtedness incurred under our Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, may rank senior to the Notes and the Guarantees, while certain other indebtedness
that we may incur may rank pari passu with, be structurally senior to, or be secured by assets that do not form
part of the Collateral for, the Notes and the Guarantees. The Conditions of Issue will permit subsidiaries of
the Issuer that are not Guarantors to incur additional debt in certain circumstances. In the event of any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of such additional indebtedness will
generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are
made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally
subordinated to the additional creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Furthermore, if we or any of our
subsidiaries incur additional debt that is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes, only the holders
of that debt will be entitled to the proceeds from the enforcement of the security created over such assets that
do not also secure the Notes, whereas the noteholders would only share in any proceeds distributed in
connection with the enforcement into the remaining assets (de facto subordination). Any additional
indebtedness could also mature prior to the Notes. Although the Conditions of Issue will contain restrictions
on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions, and the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with
these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the conditions
of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Conditions of Issue will not prevent us from incurring
obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Furthermore, the Conditions of Issue
will allow us to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries if certain criteria are
met. In this case, those unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified
in the Conditions of Issue and engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage. See
“Description of the Notes”, “Description of Other Indebtedness—Existing Fixed Rate Notes”and “Description
_of Other Indebtedness—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility”. If new debt is added to our and our_
subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.


-----

**_Borrowings under our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates that could increase_**
**_significantly._**

Our borrowings under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and future indebtedness that we may incur
could bear, interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to a benchmark rate as adjusted periodically
plus a margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and
maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances
that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain
risks including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging
arrangements. If interest rates rise in the future, our interest expense associated with any variable rate
obligations that are not hedged would increase, even though the amounts borrowed would remain the same,
reducing cash flow available to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities,
acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including satisfying our debt service obligations, including
under the Notes and the Guarantees. Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Interest rate risk”._

**_EURIBOR or other benchmarks may be discontinued or change in the future._**

Various interest rate benchmarks (including EURIBOR, which is the relevant benchmark for the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility’s base currency) have been the subject of recent national and international regulatory
guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective, including the EU Benchmark
Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented.

EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical
benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future
reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform
differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for
market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences
which cannot be predicted. Any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate
benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published
rate. This includes a sudden or prolonged increase and/or more volatility than would otherwise be, which
could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest
Furthermore, if EURIBOR (or any of its successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require
amendments to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility or other documentation that references such rate.
In relation to any of our obligations which have not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, the
rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions,
specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations. However, such provisions, if they are dependent
in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending
on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time).

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on_**
**_factors that may be beyond our control._**

Our ability to service, extend and refinance our debt and to fund future operations and capital expenditures is
highly dependent on our future operating performance and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow. To a
significant degree, our future operating performance and ability to generate cash flows is, in turn, dependent
on various general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors which
are outside our control. See “—Risks Related to Our Business”. Due to any of these factors, we may be unable
to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities and our anticipated cash flow increases, sales
growth, cost savings or operational efficiency improvements may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore,
any future debt or equity financing may not be available to us in amounts which would enable us to pay the
principal premium and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

The indebtedness under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will mature in 2026, the Existing Fixed
Rates Notes will mature in 2027 and the Notes will mature in 2031. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”
and “Description of the Notes”. In addition, we have ongoing requirements to pay interest when due on our
indebtedness. To the extent our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to meet our liquidity needs
and service our debt, we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing. In addition, our subsidiaries
may be restricted in certain jurisdictions within which they operate from paying dividends or making other
distributions to us. If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources are insufficient
to pay our various obligations as they mature or to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, we and our subsidiaries
may be forced, among other things, to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditure, sell assets,


-----

or forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses. There can be no assurance that any of these
alternatives can be accomplished on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. The terms of existing or
future debt instruments and the Conditions of Issue, the conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes
conditions of issue and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility may restrict us from adopting some of
these alternatives. Further, we may be compelled to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt,
including the Notes, on or before their maturity. We may face the additional risk that in order to refinance our
debt, we could be required to agree to more onerous covenants, which would further restrict our business
operations. The occurrence of any event described above may have a materially adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time as
well as on many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing conditions in the international credit
and capital markets. Against the background that central banks have started raising interest rates to counter
inflation, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require
us to comply with more onerous covenants. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, such as the
Conditions of Issue, the conditions of issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility, may restrict us from pursuing refinancing alternatives. In addition, any failure to make
payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

In the absence of operating results and resources sufficient to service our indebtedness we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our
debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including the terms of the Conditions of
Issue, the conditions of issues of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,
will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and our ability to use the proceeds from any such disposal. We
may not be able to carry out certain disposals or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the
proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to
meet any of our debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may
not permit us to meet our debt service obligations.

**RISKS RELATED TO THE NOTES**

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to additional indebtedness that we may incur to the_**
**_extent such debt is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes._**

Although the Conditions of Issue restrict the Issuer’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pledge any
assets as collateral to secure other debt and require the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure the
Notes equally and ratably if we pledge any assets for the benefit of certain other debt, both the restriction on
pledging assets or incurring liens and the requirement to provide equal security to the Notes are subject to a
number of significant exceptions and carve-outs. See “Description of the Notes—Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens”. For example, if the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries acquire assets subject to security interests_
securing other indebtedness, such security interests will be permitted to remain in place under the terms of the
Conditions of Issue and will not trigger a requirement to secure the Notes or Guarantees equally and ratably.
To the extent the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries pledges any assets for the benefit of other debt
without also securing the Notes, the Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to such debt to
the extent of the value of such assets. As a result of the foregoing, holders of (present or future) secured debt
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries may recover disproportionately more on their claims than the
Holders in an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding. The Issuer and the Guarantors may not have
sufficient assets remaining to satisfy our obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees, respectively.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries will not have any
obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they
guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors
and preference shareholders (if any), will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary
over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by Holders under the Notes or the
Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization,
administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries,
holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims
from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity.
As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade


-----

creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the terms of
the Conditions of Issue and our other indebtedness allow the non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional
debt in the future, which will be structurally senior to the Notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be or is subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Conditions of Issue, the conditions of Issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the
terms of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued.
The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect
the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.
Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including
the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements (including registration requirements), statutory liens or
re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security
interests in collateral. Furthermore, because we operate in a market environment subject to production
overcapacity from time to time, it may be difficult for the Security Agent to sell our manufacturing facilities or
other assets in an enforcement scenario. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third
party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent. In
addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given, when required, to facilitate a foreclosure on such
assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value
of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and other_**
**_Credit Facilities, Priority Hedging Liabilities and Cash Management Liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the_**
**_proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes._**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis with
security interests over Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, other Credit Facilities (as defined below), certain Hedging Obligations
and Cash Management Liabilities. The Conditions of Issue also permit the Collateral to be pledged to secure
additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, in an enforcement scenario the liabilities under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and other Credit Facilities as well as Priority Hedging Liabilities and certain Cash Management
Liabilities will be settled first by application of any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant
to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure on the
Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the aggregate amount of the then-outstanding
claims under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, other Credit Facilities, Priority Hedging Liabilities
and Cash Management Liabilities are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement
sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,
other Credit Facilities, Priority Hedging Liabilities and Cash Management Liabilities have been discharged
from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the
Collateral on an equal basis with the Notes, including the Existing Fixed Rate Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who also serves as the security agent for
the holders of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
and other Credit Facilities, our hedging obligations, our Cash Management Liabilities and any additional
secured debt permitted to be incurred under the Conditions of Issue, the condition of issue of the Existing
Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, will act only as provided for in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

In general, the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Existing Fixed
Rate Notes and holders of the Notes and any permitted future senior secured debt, voting as provided below,
will have, subject to certain restrictions, the ability to provide enforcement instructions to the Security Agent
to enforce the shared Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, where there is an inconsistency
between enforcement instructions provided by the holders of 66[2]∕3% of the aggregate of all commitments and
(as applicable) outstanding liabilities under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the other Credit
Facilities, certain hedging liabilities and cash management liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”)
and the holders of more than 50% of the total pari passu credit and pari passu hedge commitments and (as
applicable) outstanding liabilities (the “Majority Pari Passu Creditors”), the latter instructions will prevail.
However, if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and other


-----

super senior liabilities have not been fully discharged within six months of issuance of the initial proposed
instructions as to enforcement or no enforcement action has been taken within three months of such date or
an insolvency event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) occurs in respect of a debtor or the Parent
and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement, the enforcement instructions provided by the
Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. The lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
and other Credit Facilities, hedge counterparties in respect of Priority Hedging Liabilities and cash
management providers may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes, and
they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the
Transaction Security Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) at a time when it would be
disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of other respects.
Other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the
Issuer or its subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection
under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced
in value.

In addition, in certain circumstances, including acceleration of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,
the Existing Fixed Rate Notes or the Notes, any amounts recovered from the enforcement of Collateral or
other asset sales will be required to be turned over to the Security Agent. Subject to the prior payment of fees
and expenses of the facility agent under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the facility agent under
any other Credit Facility, the holders’ representative of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, the Holders’
Representative and any other party that has acceded in an equivalent capacity, the hedge counterparties, the
cash management providers and the Security Agent, the Intercreditor Agreement requires the Security Agent
to pay amounts turned over to it or otherwise received by it in respect of the Notes, such as proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral and other asset sales, to the lenders and arrangers under the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility and any other Credit Facility and counterparties to Priority Hedging Liabilities and
cash management providers in priority to the holders of the Notes.

**_Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantee Agreement and the relevant security agreements will provide that each Guarantee and the
Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors and
security providers (including those that relate to general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, financial assistance or thin-capitalization rules or other similar laws or
regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction). See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or security provider may have no
liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, depending on the amounts of
its other obligations and applicable law.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other
laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s or security provider’s obligations
under its Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, (ii) direct that the recipient returns any amounts paid under
a Guarantee, or return any proceeds received in connection with the enforcement of Collateral, to the relevant
Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors
or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

- the relevant Guarantee was incurred, or the relevant Collateral was granted, with actual intent to give
preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the
Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the
Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the
recipient was aware that the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent when it granted
the relevant Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable;

- the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, did not receive fair consideration or reasonably
equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, and the
Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the
relevant Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because
of the relevant Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would
incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;


-----

- the relevant Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, was held to exceed the corporate objects of the
Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit
of the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or enforced or to be enforced under the relevant
Collateral, as applicable, was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or
similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee or Collateral granted by any of our subsidiaries
pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security
provider, as applicable, was “insolvent”at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation,
a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent on that date,
or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider, as
applicable, was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or Collateral was granted, as applicable, that
payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other
grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, under its Guarantee or Collateral, as
applicable, will be contractually limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or Collateral, as
applicable, not constituting a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, a violation of capital maintenance
rules or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply
in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as applicable.
There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, may be set aside, in which case the
entire liability may be extinguished.

If a court decided that a Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, was a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance and voided such Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, or held it unenforceable for any other
reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider, as
applicable, and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor or security
provider under the relevant Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, that has not been declared void. In the
event that any Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the
extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, obligations apply, the Notes would
be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, and if we cannot
satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, is found to be a
preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can repay
in full the amounts outstanding under the Notes.

See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_Enforcement of the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or
a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the Collateral will
thus be subject to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such
rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional
proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and
delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions
could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to
enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees. A summary description
of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany and certain other jurisdictions are set out in “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security_
_Interests”._

**_You may be required to pay a cash amount (“soulte”) in the event you decide to enforce the pledge over securities_**
**_granted under French law by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of securities rather_**
**_than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and
unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities account may generally be enforced at the option of the
secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the
sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or
contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which


-----

the secured creditors become the legal owners of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to
enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities
would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by
the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre contractually agreed expert in the context of a
contractual foreclosure.

If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay
the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined
and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately
received by the secured creditors from a subsequent on sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining
amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled
by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the
acquisition of companies or groups of companies. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests—France—Limitations on_
_enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)”._

**_The insolvency laws of Germany, France, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom or other relevant jurisdictions may_**
**_not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering_**
**_payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the
United Kingdom. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in
Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom or other relevant jurisdictions. Such multijurisdictional proceedings may be complex and more costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater
uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees
and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions, and there
can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other
and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and
other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of
these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law
should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees in those
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. For example, under English insolvency law, among
other powers, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an order to set
aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the
creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue or constituted a
preference, each as defined in the relevant insolvency laws and in each case, where the action took place within
a specified time period before the insolvency of the relevant entity.

For more information, regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees
and security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected in terms of validity, enforceability, ranking
or otherwise with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, the Security Agent or any other third party, fail or
are unable to take the actions (e.g., as for filing, registration, modification or other requirements) required to
perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Holders’ Representative nor the
Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens.


-----

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the Notes may fall within the scope of hardening periods_**
**_for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, when issued, may fall within the
scope of hardening periods in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions. The applicable
hardening period for these security interests will run as from the moment each security interest has been
granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be
enforced before the end of the respective applicable hardening period, it may be declared void and/or it may
not be possible to enforce it. In addition, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future
indebtedness may restart or reopen hardening periods. If the security interest were granted or recreated or
were to be enforced during the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Notes may not rank pari passu_**
**_with the Collateral granted in favor of lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and creditors of_**
**_any other indebtedness sharing the Collateral, and we are relying on the Intercreditor Agreement to achieve an_**
**_equal priority lien in respect of such Collateral._**

Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, we will enter into new security documents over the Collateral with
respect to the additional debt represented by the Notes. In certain jurisdictions, the security granted under
those additional security documents will, because they are being granted at a later point in time, rank junior
to security interests in the Collateral granted in favor of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the
Existing Fixed Rate Notes and any other indebtedness sharing the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement
provides that the benefit of the first and junior ranking pledges and other security interests over such
Collateral be shared equally by the holders of the Notes and other pari passu debt, such as the Existing Fixed
Rate Notes, the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and other Credit Facilities, hedge
counterparties in respect of hedging obligations, cash management providers and the other secured creditors.
However, the distribution of proceeds after an enforcement of the pledges (which are equalized under the law
of obligations by the Intercreditor Agreement and share equally in their ranking) is subject to super senior
priority status accorded to certain liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, see
“Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and other
_Credit Facilities, Priority Hedging Liabilities and Cash Management Liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the_
_proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes.”. Therefore, the ranking of_
Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Notes in such jurisdictions will depend on the enforceability of
the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, if the Intercreditor Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable
for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the Collateral granted in favor of holders of
the Notes in these jurisdictions may rank behind any other existing Collateral, including Collateral granted in
favor of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes.

**_The security interests in the Collateral and the Guarantees will be granted to the Security Agent rather than_**
**_directly to you._**

The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under
the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the
holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Conditions of Issue will
provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Transaction Security Documents (as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Guarantees in accordance with the terms thereof. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests or Guarantee claims and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes or the Guarantees, except through the Holders’ Representative, who will (on
behalf of the holders of the Notes and subject to the provisions of the Conditions of Issue, the Guarantee
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral or the Guarantees.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken.
For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets,
but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty
under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not
identified as registered holders in a Transaction Security Document will be validly secured. In certain
jurisdictions, including, among others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the


-----

creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the respective
Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the
Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under
the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements
relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original
secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity
of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time
as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal
**Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding**
parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal
Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer
and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested
in court in these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity.
Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt
structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent.

In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement,
diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Guarantees. See “Certain Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations”._

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral and the_**
**_Guarantees may be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Holders’ Representative._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released automatically,
including, without limitation, the following:

- in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of Collateral to any
person other than the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary, if the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition does not violate the provisions described under “Description of the Notes—
Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets” and is otherwise in compliance with the relevant Conditions
of Issue;

- upon redemption of all the Notes;

- in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee (with respect to the liens securing such
Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);

- if a restricted subsidiary is designated to be an unrestricted subsidiary, the release of the property, assets
and capital stock of such restricted subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Conditions of Issue;

- as described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”, “Description of the Notes—
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “Description of the Notes—Covenants—Impairment of_
_Security Interest”;_

- if the lien granted in favor of other indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the lien over
such Collateral is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge thereof); and as provided
for in the Transaction Security Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

- with respect to security interests over certain machinery and equipment of Wepa UK Ltd, upon, and at
the same time as, the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and
all liens (other than Permitted Liens) over such Collateral securing any Indebtedness, so long as no Event
of Default exists at such time or would arise as a result of such release.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees may be released automatically, including, without
limitation, the following:

- in the event of any sale, exchange or transfer (including by merger or otherwise) (i) of the capital stock of
a Guarantor, after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a restricted subsidiary, or (ii) of all or
substantially all the assets of such Guarantor to a person that is not the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary,
which sale, exchange or transfer is permitted under, and made in compliance with, the relevant Conditions
of Issue

- upon redemption of all the Notes;


-----

- if a Guarantor is designated to be an unrestricted subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Conditions of Issue;

- upon the release of any Guarantee of indebtedness that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee under
the Conditions of Issue, so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that
such Guarantor does not guarantee certain other debt;

- in accordance with the provisions of the Transaction Security Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement), the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

- as described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”and “Description of the Notes—
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”._

**_We may not be able to repay the Notes when due or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to do so_**
**_pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision_**
**_contained in the Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important_**
**_corporate events._**

At final maturity of the Notes, or in the event of acceleration of the Notes following an event of default
including a cross acceleration event, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes will become due
and payable. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of
the Notes may in certain circumstances require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of
_Control”. The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to_
pay these amounts when they become due.

The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a change of
control event would result in an event of default under the Notes. We cannot assure you that we would have
sufficient funds to repay our outstanding indebtedness which we would be required to prepay or offer to
purchase or that became immediately due and payable as a result. We may require additional financing from
third parties to fund any such purchases and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing
on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions in our other then-existing contractual obligations may also restrict
us from making such required repurchases.

A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of our then-existing indebtedness,
and the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness even
if the change of control itself does not. The change of control provision contained in the Conditions of Issue
may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including
reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you,
because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they
do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Conditions of Issue.

The definition of “change of control” contained in the Conditions of Issue includes a disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a
limited body of case law in some jurisdictions interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under law and there is no German case law interpreting “all or
substantially all” in the context of terms and conditions of high yield notes or other debt instruments.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred
and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Certain amendments to the Conditions of Issue may be passed with the consent of 90% of less than the majority_**
**_of the Notes outstanding._**

The Conditions of Issue may be amended by a vote of the holders of the Notes. Amendments require a
majority of not less than 50.1% of votes cast or, for certain amendments, 90% of the votes cast as opposed to
50.1% or 90%, respectively, of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding. Certain further
amendments to the Conditions of Issue require approval of 100% of the holders of the Notes. The voting
process under the Conditions of Issue will be governed in accordance with the German Act on Debt Securities
of 2009 (Gesetz über Schuldverschreibungen aus Gesamtemissionen, Schuldverschreibungsgesetz, SchVG),
pursuant to which the quorum for noteholder votes is principally set at a simple majority. Accordingly, the


-----

aggregate principal amount of Notes required to vote in favor of an amendment will vary based on the
noteholder votes participating. For example, if the holders of less than 55.5% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes participate in a vote, any proposed amendment, including amendments subject to the
90% threshold, can be passed with less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
consenting. See “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in Germany. Other Guarantors of the Notes are
incorporated in France, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. Each member of our management team and
the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States, and all of our
assets and the assets of the Guarantors and such persons are located outside the United States. It may not be
possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, a Guarantor or
such persons or to enforce against any of them in U.S. courts judgments predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, and there is doubt as to the enforceability in the
home jurisdictions of the other Guarantors of civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the
United States, either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts. It may also
not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or
those persons under the Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or
Commercial Matters and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to
infringe German sovereignty or security, particularly if such service violated the German Constitutional Law
(Grundgesetz). If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or any Guarantor or a security
provider, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets.
As all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the assets of its and their directors are located outside
of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against us or them.
See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the
securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the
United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction.
See “Transfer Restrictions”. It is the obligation of holders of the Notes to ensure that their purchase and any
subsequent transfer of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable
securities laws. Any of these restrictions and requirements will limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes
and the Guarantees.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be_**
**_limited._**

The Notes will be new securities for which there is no market. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any
market that may develop for the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes, or the prices at which you would be able
to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices
of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by
a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have
a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The
Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. The Initial
Purchasers are not, however, obliged to do so, and they may discontinue any market-making activities at any
time without notice. As a result, there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Notes.
If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange._**

Although the Issuer will, in the Conditions of Issue, agree to use its reasonable best efforts to have the Notes
listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) within a reasonable period
after the issue date of the Notes and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer


-----

cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the
Official List of the Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer
may cease to make or maintain such listing, provided that it will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and
maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the
Issuer will be able to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any time,
without the consent of the Holders or the Holders’ Representative, de-list the Notes from any stock exchange
for the purposes of moving the listing of the Notes to another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers
(which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union). Although no assurance is
made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another
recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Conditions of Issue, failure to be
approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock
exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with
the Conditions of Issue may have a material effect on a Holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary
market.

**_The interests of Holders of the Notes may be inconsistent with those of the holders of the Existing Fixed Rate_**
**_Notes and the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility._**

The Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility each have different maturity
dates, prepayment schedules and prepayment provisions and may have other features that differ from the
corresponding terms in the Conditions of Issues governing the Notes. As a result of these differences, the
interests of holders of the Notes could conflict with those of the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and the holders of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes. For example, the lenders under our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes may be in a position to agree to
certain amendments that would be beneficial to them but adverse to the economic interest of the Holder of
the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes offered hereby are denominated and payable in euros. If you measure your investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange risks related
to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by
reference to which you measure the return on your investments because of economic, political and other
factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which
you measure the return on your investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below
the stated coupon rate and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the
currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. There may be tax consequences
for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from an investment in the Notes. See
“Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies are expected to assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit
ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect
the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and
other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit
rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency in the future if in its judgment
circumstances so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to
the Notes by one or more credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and Conditions of Issue of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Conditions of Issue will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Conditions of Issue, the
Notes receive a rating of “BBB-” or better from Standard & Poor’s and “Baa3” or better from Moody’s and
no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until
such time that the Notes receive a rating of below “BBB-” from Standard & Poor’s and below “Baa3” from
Moody’s, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—


-----

_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants”. If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to_
incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with
the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment
grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

A series of Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a series of
Notes is issued with original issue discount, in addition to the stated cash interest on such Notes, U.S. holders
(as defined under “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) will generally be required to
include the amounts representing the original issue discount in gross income on a constant yield basis in
advance of receipt of the cash payments to which such income is attributable. See “Taxation—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations”._

**_The market value of the Notes may be adversely affected if additional notes are considered to have OID and are_**
**_not distinguishable from such the Notes._**

The Issuer may issue additional notes (“Additional Notes”) as described under “Description of the Notes”.
These Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as a series of
original Notes, in some cases may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such
a case, the Additional Notes may be considered to have OID (or a greater amount of OID) which may
adversely affect the market value of such series of original Notes as it will not be possible to distinguish the
original Notes from the Additional Notes.

**_The Notes will be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing_**
**_systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Clearstream Banking.
Interests in the global notes will be recorded in book-entry form only. Ownership of interests in each global
note will be limited to persons who have accounts with Clearstream Banking or persons who hold interests
through participants. The global notes representing the Notes will be deposited with Clearstream Banking.
Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the
Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft as Paying Agent, which will make payments to
Clearstream Banking. Clearstream Banking will, in turn, distribute those payments to its participants that
hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes in accordance with its procedures and
these payments will be credited by such participants to indirect participants for the benefit of the holders of
the co-ownership interests (Miteigentumsanteile) in the Notes represented by each global note. After payment
to Clearstream Banking, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts in respect of the Notes. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the
procedures of Clearstream Banking and, if you are not a participant in Clearstream Banking, on the
procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of
a holder under the Conditions of Issue. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be €250.0 million. We will use the proceeds from the
Offering (i) to redeem in full the €200,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate
Notes on or about, 2024 (the “Floating Rate Notes Redemption Date”), (ii) to pay an
extraordinary cash dividend of €20.0 million to our Parent on or around, 2024, (iii) to pay other
costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iv) for general corporate purposes
(including to finance a portion of the purchase price we paid for the UK Acquisition, see also “Summary—
_Recent Developments”)._

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds. The actual amounts set forth in the
table and in the accompanying footnotes are subject to adjustment and may differ at the time of the
consummation of the Transactions depending on several factors, including differences from our estimate of
costs, fees and expenses.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table shows our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and our capitalization as of
September 30, 2023, on a historical basis and as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, as described under
“Summary—The Refinancing and the Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds” as if they had occurred on
September 30, 2023.

The historical consolidated financial information in the following table has been derived from our unaudited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. All data in the table below represent the carrying amounts except for
the Notes offered hereby. The adjusted information below is illustrative only and does not purport to be
indicative of our capitalization following the completion of the Transactions.

You should read this table in conjunction with “Summary—The Refinancing and the Transactions”, “Use of
_Proceeds”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,_
“Description of Other Indebtedness”, “Description of the Notes”and the financial statements and notes thereto
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Except as set forth below, there have been no other material

of the Offering of the Notes, the redemption in full of the Existing Floating Rate Notes and the payment of the Extraordinary
Cash Dividend as described under “Use of Proceeds”, in each case as if they had occurred on September 30, 2023. Our cash and
cash equivalents on the Issue Date will be different. The as adjusted amount does not reflect an estimated € million of
accrued and unpaid interest payable to the holders of the Existing Floating Rate Notes on the Floating Rate Notes Redemption
Date with regard to the period from and including December 15, 2023, the last interest payment date for the Existing Floating Rate
Notes, to but excluding the Floating Rate Notes Redemption Date. We expect to use a portion of the proceeds from the Offering to
finance a portion of the purchase price we paid for the UK Acquisition. For details, see “Summary—Recent Developments”. We
had cash and cash equivalents of €39.0 million as of November 30, 2023.

(2) Our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility provides for up to €150.0 million of committed credit. The Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility will remain undrawn on the Issue Date. For more detail about the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility”.

(3) Bilateral loans and other bank liabilities reflect temporary overdrafts as of the balance sheet date by one of our subsidiaries.

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes to be redeemed in connection with the Transactions.
(5) Represents the €250.0 million of aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be issued in the Offering.
(6) The adjusted figure reflects the estimated fees and expenses payable in connection with the Transactions in the amount of
€4.5 million. It also reflects the €20.0 million Extraordinary Cash Dividend to our Parent we propose to declare and pay on or
around, 2024. The adjusted figure does not reflect an estimated € million of accrued and unpaid interest
payable to the holders of the Existing Floating Rate Notes on the Floating Rate Notes Redemption Date with regard to the period
from and including December 15, 2023, the last interest payment date for the Existing Floating Rate Notes, to but excluding the
Floating Rate Notes Redemption Date. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA**

The financial information contained in the following tables is derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and from the
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023 as well as from the accounting records and other internal documents of the Issuer. The
results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year or any future period.

In addition, this offering memorandum includes certain unaudited consolidated financial information for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023. This information was derived by adding our consolidated financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2022 derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
to our unaudited consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and
subtracting our unaudited consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

The consolidated financial statements and the other historical consolidated financial information presented
below have been prepared on the basis of German GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from
IFRS. For a discussion of significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Significant Differences_
_between German GAAP and IFRS”._

In this offering memorandum, we present certain non-GAAP measures and ratios, including gross profit,
EBITDA, EBITDA margin, EBIT, income/(loss) before tax, trade working capital, free cash flow, free cash
flow, free cash flow (adjusted for ABS Program) and pro forma data that are not required by, or presented in
accordance with, German GAAP. Our management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP
measures is helpful to investors because these and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors,
security analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.
However, you should not construe these non-GAAP measures as an alternative to net income determined in
accordance with German GAAP or to cash flows from operations, investing activities or financing activities.
In addition, the non-GAAP measures and ratios, including gross profit, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, EBIT,
income/(loss) before tax, trade working capital, free cash flow, free cash flow, free cash flow (adjusted for ABS
Program) and pro forma data presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies. We also present below certain operating data which have not been derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements, but from other internal sources of the Issuer.

The following tables also set forth certain pro forma consolidated financial information, after giving effect to
the issuance of the Notes in this Offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom. See “Use of
_Proceeds”._

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data and operational
volumes presented in million or thousand and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to
rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly
from the actual arithmetic totals of such information.

You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the sections “Presentation of Financial
_Information”, “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization”, “Selected Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion_

**OVERVIEW**

We are a leading European, family-owned producer and supplier of tissue products with a market share (by
production volumes) of 8.1% in Europe and 10.2% in Western Europe, both according to RISI. Based on our
Internal Private Label Mapping 2022, we believe we are the leading private label consumer tissue paper
producer in our core markets of Germany, the BeNeLux region, France and Italy with a market share, by
volume, between approximately 17-32% in these markets. In addition, we believe we are the second largest
private label consumer tissue paper producer in the UK and the third largest in Poland. We are convinced we
differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our strong and future-oriented commitment to the
European tissue paper business, with a clear focus on sustainability, product innovation and continuous
strategic investments in our asset base.

Headquartered in Arnsberg, Germany, we offer a full range of folded and rolled tissue products such as toilet
paper, kitchen towels, handkerchiefs, hand towels, facial tissues, napkins, industrial paper rolls and paper
towels as well as semi-finished products (i.e. jumbo reels and de-inked pulp). We produce our tissue products
on 22 paper machines and over 80 converting lines. Our fourteen production sites are located strategically
across Europe in Germany, Italy, France, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and we had an
average of 3,785 employees in 2022. Our production capacities make us the third largest producer of tissue
products (by volume) in the European tissue market, a market exhibiting resilient demand characteristics with
low product substitution risk. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have an installed tissue paper
production capacity of 850,000 tons and an installed tissue paper converting capacity of 847,000 tons to
convert tissue paper into tissue products. Approximately 48% of our production capacity and 45% of our
converting capacity is located in Germany, our core market and Europe’s largest tissue market. We also own
technologically advanced facilities for the production of de-inked pulp from recovered paper, with an annual
capacity of more than 390,000 tons. Due to this and our long-standing focus on sustainable products and
production, we believe we are the largest producer of tissue products from recovered paper and hybrid
products in Europe, with total sales of €1,636.4 million in 2022. In the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2023, we sold 724,000 tons of finished tissue products, 35,000 tons of de-inked pulp and 29,000
tons of jumbo reels across Europe, which generated €1,865.1 million and €318.2 million of sales and EBITDA,
respectively, in such period.

We operate our business primarily through our two business units Consumer and Professional. In our
Consumer business unit, we are a private-label specialist for European retailers, selling our tissue products
branded under our retail customers’ own labels. Our Professional business unit with the brands BlackSatino


-----

and Satino by WEPA stands for sustainable and professional hygiene solutions for large commercial and
institutional customers, served through leading distributors. In addition to our two core business units, and in
line with our vision to be the most sustainable, best-in-class partner for personal and professional hygiene
solutions, we have recently set up a “New Business Areas” business unit, focusing on the expansion of our
product and service portfolio, in particular through innovation, e-commerce and circular economy.

Our Consumer business unit, which represented 85% of our sales from finished products in our financial year
2022 and 86% of our sales from finished products in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023,
offers a full range of consumer tissue products: toilet paper, kitchen towels, facial tissues, handkerchiefs and
napkins. While the key focus of our Consumer business unit is on the private label sector, we also market some
products under our own brands such as Mach m!t…, Comprami, Perla and Scala. Our Professional business
unit, which has a more regional focus within Central Europe and Poland, focuses on tissue products for large
commercial and institutional customers, such as government agencies, hotels, restaurants, private enterprises,
hospitals and other healthcare providers. It offers a broad range of tissue products with a focus on our own
brands Satino by WEPA and BlackSatino, including toilet paper and paper towels, industrial rolls, kitchen
rolls as well as accessories like comprehensive dispenser systems for washrooms. In addition to the brand
business, our Professional business unit offers also private label and unbranded products. In both
business units, we also generate revenues from the sale of semi-finished products, such as de-inked pulp and
jumbo reels, with the amount of such sales varying and primarily depending on our own internal demand.

**KEY FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

**COVID-19 Pandemic**

Our results of operations in 2020 and 2021 were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which
led to a significant volatility of sales in both our Consumer and Professionals business units. At the start of
the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April 2020, panic buying by end-consumers occurred across most
parts of Europe, particularly with respect to toilet paper and other hygienic articles. In order to be able to


-----

meet the resulting unprecedented short-term demand for our products and to be able to continue to supply
our customers, we were forced to adapt both our sales and manufacturing operations to focus on core
products. This initial sales peak was followed by a sharp sales decline in April and May 2020, which gave us the
opportunity to restock our warehouses. However, sales in the second quarter of 2020 differed significantly
between regions. While sales in Italy returned to a normal level, sales in the BeNeLux region decreased due to
a general closure of all non-food stores (including drugstores). As a result of a drop in the market prices for
pulp, we further faced strong pressure from our customers to reduce the prices for our products in almost all
regions, which resulted in price reductions in the third quarter of 2020. See also “Key Factors Affecting our
_Results of Operations—Exposure to Fluctuations in Pulp and Recovered Paper Prices” below for the impact of_
the COVID-19 pandemic on the prices of our main raw materials, pulp and recovered paper. In response to
rising infection figures in the fourth quarter of 2020, retailers across Europe filled their warehouses in
anticipation of further lockdowns. Increasingly stringent COVID-19 restrictions in many jurisdictions led to
renewed panic buying, especially in Germany and the United Kingdom, but not to the same extent as in the
first quarter of 2020. Our Professional business unit was especially hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as a
result of the closure of hotels, restaurants, schools and other public spaces, while sales by volume of our
Consumer business unit increased by 7% in 2020, with large parts of the population spending more time at
home.

The COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on the tissue industry across Europe and, as
a result, on our results of operations in 2021, especially in the first quarter. Following a further increase in
sales of tissue paper at the end of 2020 in many of our key markets, mirroring increasing infection levels, there
was a corresponding decline in tissue paper sales across Europe in the first quarter of 2021, which had a
significant negative impact on our sales. In addition, some retailers had pursued a policy of high stock levels
and partially built up inventories with imported products in order to be prepared for further panic buying.
This was particularly evident in Germany, where retailers mainly filled their warehouses with various branded
products from Eastern Europe and Russia. This approach by a number of our key customers led to a
comparatively low demand for our products from those customers during the first half of 2021. In the second
quarter of 2021, sales recovered slowly in both our Consumer and Professionals business unit, but volatility in
sales volumes was still noticeable. Sales of our Professional business unit only rebounded gradually, in response
to the gradual removal of COVID-19 restrictions, with restaurants, cafés and hotels gradually allowed to
reopen across Europe. Sales volumes in our Consumer business unit returned to normal levels by the end of
the third quarter of 2021, and with schools, offices, restaurants and hotels reopening, sales volumes of our
Professional business unit also gradually started to recover, although they remained below pre-pandemic levels.

High infection numbers during parts of 2020 and 2021, as well as country-specific rules and regulations, such
as lockdowns and other COVID-19 restrictions, in response to the high infection numbers led to further
changes in shopping behavior by end-consumers. These behavioral changes added to the volatility in sales
volumes and impacted supply chains and distribution channels, creating additional challenges for us. In
particular, we observed a change in consumer purchasing behavior towards “one-stop shopping”in all regions,
which led to supermarkets temporarily taking market share from discounters and drugstores. Supermarkets
that offered an online shopping option also benefited. For example, German retailer and WEPA customer
Edeka entered into a new purchasing partnership with Dutch online supermarket group Picnic in 2020. The
COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the existing trend towards more online shopping. Examples of how
we responded to this trend include a collaboration with Amazon in Germany, with the first products from
Amazon’s “Essentials” range (partly produced by us) available to consumers since the fourth quarter of 2021.
In 2021, we also launched e-commerce cooperations with e-retailers Rohlik Group and Cleangang.

In addition to the unprecedented volatility of our sales and changes in shopping behavior during 2020 and
2021, the COVID-19 pandemic also created a number of other challenges for our Group. First and foremost,
we had to ensure the health and safety of our employees, while also meeting our delivery commitments to our
customers, which we successfully managed to achieve notwithstanding the special challenges posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic. In line with significant fluctuations of the incidence of COVID-19 infections in the
general population, fluctuating infection levels among our employees led to significant staff absences.
However, as these staff absences affected different production sites at different times and to different degrees,
we were largely able to compensate localized staff-shortages by shifting production to less affected production
sites due to our broad production network and geographic footprint, although this did create logistical
challenges.

As described above, our results of operations in 2021 were significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. As a result, the comparability of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020
and December 31, 2021, in particular, with the other periods under review and with future periods might be

limited. However, we believe that our business demonstrated resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, we managed to meet our delivery obligations to our customers and we
managed to preserve sufficient liquidity without the need for any additional capital measures. Although we
still felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with very volatile infection figures, our sales volumes and
margins in both our Consumer and Professional business units recovered strongly during 2022. See also “Risk
_Factors—We may be adversely affected by uncertainty and/or unfavorable economic and/or political conditions”._

With the COVID-19 pandemic now officially behind us, the shopping behavior of our end-customers has
again shifted, due to the ongoing cost of living crisis as well as worries about the growing climate crisis and
therefore increasing sustainability awareness and the ongoing war in Ukraine and worsening geopolitical
climate. See also “—Russia-Ukraine Conflict, Supply Chain Shortages and Cost Inflation” below. Specifically,
end-consumers appear to have become increasingly price aware during 2022 and 2023, which has allowed
discounters and drugstores to win back market share. The growth of the online business has also slowed
noticeably, although e-commerce remains an important future market for our Group.

**Russia-Ukraine Conflict, Supply Shortages and Cost Inflation**

In February 2022, Russia launched a military attack against Ukraine. In response, the United States, the EU,
the United Kingdom and other countries have been imposing increasingly stringent sanctions on a number of
Russian and Belarusian persons and entities, including, but not limited to, certain financial institutions, energy,
media, technology and defense companies, as well as individuals associated with the Russian President and
his government. The Russian Federation has responded with the imposition of countersanctions on so-called
“unfriendly” states (which include EU Member States). These developments have led to a high degree of
uncertainty in the global markets.

We have not had any operations in either Russia or Ukraine, except for some immaterial and sporadic
purchases of semi-finished good and sales of finished goods, which we quickly terminated following the start
of the Russian invasion in the Ukraine. However, the Russian war against Ukraine has created, or exacerbated,
significant challenges for our business. Steep further increases in energy prices, fears of gas supply shortages
and general supply shortages due to worldwide supply chain disruptions posed major challenges for Europe,
with the tissue industry particularly affected as an energy-intensive sector. In addition, sharply rising raw
material and transport prices as well as rising rates of inflation across Europe made significant, incremental
price increases for our finished and semi-finished products unavoidable during the course of 2022. See also
“Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Exposure to Fluctuations in Pulp and Recovered Paper
_Prices”, “—Exposure to Fluctuations in Energy Prices” and “—Exposure to Fluctuations in Freight/Logistics_
_Costs” below._

In responding to the unprecedent cost increases during the course of 2022, in particular with regard to energy
costs, we believe we benefited from our performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, which helped us to
further strengthen our long-standing reputation as a reliable, innovative and transparent partner with longstanding, strong and trusting relationships with our customers. We successfully shortened contract cycles
with our customers and took various measures to enhance the energy efficiency of our production to allow us
to respond more quickly to the ongoing volatility of our input costs.

With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic slowly receding during the course of 2022, the war in Ukraine
and the unprecedented energy price increases which followed quickly became the dominant drivers for our
business starting in the first quarter of 2022. Panic buying occurred again in the immediate aftermath of the
invasion of Ukraine, and the steep energy price increases continued in the second and third quarter of 2022,
especially after Russia almost completely stopped gas deliveries to Europe. The impact of these energy price
increases was compounded by production constraints, limited freight capacity, raw materials price increases,
and staff shortages due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. Most retailers therefore shifted their focus to
security of supply to avoid empty shelves. In response to the steep increases in the prices for our raw materials
and energy, in particular, we successfully implemented several rounds of significant, incremental sales price
increases for our products beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and throughout 2022, with the last round
of substantial sales price increases coming into effect at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2022, based on
peak pulp and energy prices during the third quarter of 2022. As before, we strove for transparency with our
customers by clearly communicating the development of our input costs and the outlook for the winter period.
As a result of our strong customer relationships, we succeeded in implementing the required price increases
without losing business or trust.

The extent and duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, resulting sanctions and any related market
disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial, particularly if current or new sanctions


-----

continue for an extended period of time or if geopolitical tensions result in expanded or prolonged military
operations. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly
unpredictable, it could have a further material adverse effect on European economies, including the markets in
which we operate.

While the Russian invasion of Ukraine created very significant challenges for our business, both our sales and
EBITDA increased significantly from €1,205.9 million and €93.1 million, respectively, in 2021, to
€1,636.4 million and €145.6 million, respectively, in 2022, and €1,865.1 million and €318.2 million, respectively,
in in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, as we successfully managed to pass increases in our
input costs through to our customers, as described above. As with our response to the challenges posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic (see “—COVID-19 Pandemic” above), we believe that the way in which we have
overcome the challenges caused, or exacerbated, by the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates the
resilience of our business. But see also “Risk Factors—We may be adversely affected by uncertainty and/or
_unfavorable economic and/or political conditions”._

**KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

**Revenue Drivers**

Our revenues are driven by demand from retailers (and their end customers) in our Consumer business unit
and by specialist distributors and wholesalers (and their end customers) in our Professional business unit.
Sales to our Consumer customers are driven by underlying demand for our products, which in recent years
has generally grown steadily and independently from the overall economic environment. Sales to our
Professional customers have some correlation to overall economic trends, although this is limited by our
exposure to customers in the government, health care and educational sectors. See “Key Factors Affecting the
_Comparability of Our Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” above, for the unprecedented disruption_
and volatility of our sales of both our Consumer and Professional business units caused by the COVID-19
pandemic during 2020, 2021 and parts of 2022.

The volumes we sell are determined by our relationships with our customers and competition from alternative
suppliers, which has been stable in most of our core markets. Although new players could enter the market or
existing players could add new capacity, given lead time requirements of 18 to 24 months, we believe we will
have good visibility on any new capacity being added. A change to overall capacity levels could lead to a
change in levels of competition, which would affect our results of operations.

In addition to general market factors, our revenues have also been, and will continue to be, affected by a
number of investments we have made in recent years and by the additional capital expenditures we intend to
incur in the short- to mid-term. See also “—Expansion Projects and Investment Program; Sustainable Capacity
_Management” above._

**Exposure to Fluctuations in Pulp and Recovered Paper Prices**

The main raw materials for the production of our products are pulp and recovered paper. Pulp is our largest
and recovered paper our third largest purchasing cost item, accounting for 34.8% (€379.4 million) and 9.4%
(€102.7 million), respectively, of our cost of materials in 2022. This compares to 32.1% (€229.3 million) and
12.8% (€91.6 million), respectively, of our cost of materials in 2021, and 36.3% (€246.3 million) and 10.8%
(€73.3 million), respectively, of our cost of materials in 2020. In the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023, pulp and recovered paper accounted for 38.3% (€297.2 million) and 7.2% (€56.3 million), respectively,
of our cost of materials. The prices for our raw materials, especially pulp and recovered paper, are affected by
various factors, in particular global supply and demand conditions, economic conditions in other paper
industry sectors as well as speculation, and can therefore be highly volatile. The market development for both
raw materials can be tracked through industry indices like “FOEX-PIX” for pulp (www.foex.fi) and Euwid in
particular for recovered paper. The PIX is a benchmark index and published weekly for the main pulp grades
NBSK (softwood) and BHKP (hardwood) on a gross price basis. The PIX is published both in U.S.$ and
Euro, although pulp prices are typically quoted in U.S.$ in the international markets and the euro value of the
PIX therefore merely reflects the relevant U.S.$ value of the PIX, as converted into Euros at the prevailing
exchange rate. When we agree prices for pulp and recovered paper with our suppliers, we typically negotiate
the relevant prices on a monthly basis. These prices are then tracked and published by the PIX and Euwid,
respectively. In order to maximize the specific rebates (i.e. the notional discounts from the relevant prices
published by the PIX and Euwid) negotiated with our suppliers, we continuously try to further optimize our
procurement processes and to fully leverage our purchasing power across the Wepa Group with our suppliers.
In recent years we introduced various ways of price determination in addition to the established traditional
“gross price less rebate”—pattern.


-----

On average, we use a mix of approximately 30% softwood and 70% hardwood-pulp-grades in our tissue
production, with this share varying depending on the intended characteristics of the end product. Pulp prices
can be volatile, but we regard the extreme volatility since 2020 as unprecedent. Steep price decreases during
the first half of 2020 were followed by even steeper and sustained price increases during most of 2021 and
2022, only to be followed by even faster decreases starting in the first quarter of 2023. See also “Key Factors
_Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” and “—Russia-Ukraine_
_Conflict, Supply Shortages and Cost Inflation” above. The average price per ton for pulp, based on PIX prices_
for a 30%/70% mix of softwood and hardwood pulp decreased from U.S.$895 in 2019 to U.S.$729 in 2020,
followed by steep increases to U.S.$1,070 in 2021 and U.S.$1,322 in 2022 and a decrease to U.S.$1,151 in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. In September 2023, the average price decreased to U.S.$ 908.
The equivalent prices per ton in Euro, the functional currency for the Wepa Group, also decreased from €798
in 2019 to €640 in 2020, followed by steep increases to €906 in 2021 and €1,260 in 2022 and a decrease to
€1,063 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. In September 2023, the average price decreased
to €846. While the overall trend was partly offset by a stronger euro during 2022, the euro had been weaker
than the US dollar in all the other years during the periods under review. During the same periods, the
availability and price per ton of the preferred recovered paper grade “Sorted Office Paper”(SOP, EN 643 2.06)
as reported by Euwid was even more volatile, as changes in office working (and printer) patterns led to low
collection rates of Sorted Office Paper, in particular, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating the secular
decline of the graphic printing and writing sector. At the margin, the availability of middle and lower grades
of recovered paper was also impacted by a tight pulp market. The average price per ton of Sorted Office Paper
decreased from €151 in 2019 to €129 in 2020, followed by a steep increase to €180 in 2021 and to €253 in 2022,
followed by a decrease to €156 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, dropping to a similar level
as in 2020 by September 2023.

During 2020, the most important factors influencing the pulp market were related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The demand for pulp dropped as increasingly stringent COVID-19 restrictions took effect across the globe,
especially in the printing and writing sector, and resulted in price levels for pulp at or even below marginal
costs. Prices remained stable throughout 2020 for BHKP, whereas the price for NBSK quickly lost some gains
achieved during the second quarter of 2020, to only recover modestly towards the end of 2020. By the end of
2020, softwood traded at a premium of approximately U.S.$150 over hardwood pulps. In comparison to the
fourth quarter of 2019, prices in U.S. dollars for NBSK were about 6% higher in the fourth quarter of 2020
and unchanged for BHKP, while the average prices per ton during 2020 were approximately 14% lower for
NBSK and approximately 21% lower for BHKP than the relevant average prices per ton during 2021. Demand
and supply of recovered paper were also negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the
significant drop in demand affecting large parts of the paper industry as well as an interruption of collection
activities. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the prices for recovered paper were at a similar level as during
the fourth quarter of 2019, but the full year average prices during 2020 were approximately 10% lower than
the fully year average prices during 2019.

After an unusual period of stable prices at comparatively low levels during most of 2020, the market turned at
the end of 2020 for softwood pulp, swiftly followed by the market for hardwood at the very beginning of 2021.
This kicked off a price rally that led to all-time-high prices within just seven months, after which both markets
plateaued. Only the price for softwood pulp decreased somewhat towards the end of 2021. The reasons for
these unprecedented price levels were multifold, but most were, in our view, directly or indirectly linked to the
COVID-19 pandemic. They included higher than expected demand in particular from the European printing
and writing sector, which was very hard hit during the first period of the pandemic and did not expect a
recovery in 2021, so that pulp contracts were adapted to the expected low capacity utilization. However, with
global supply chains disrupted and fewer goods imported from Asia, the European printing and writing
sector experienced an unexpectedly strong year in 2021. With global supply chains strained, demand for
market pulp therefore significantly exceeded availability, and for most of the year, softwood maintained its
premium of about U.S.$160 per ton over hardwood pulps. This premium decreased to U.S.$130 for a short
period at the end of 2021. In comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020, prices in U.S.$ for both NBSK and
BHKP were more than 50% higher in the fourth quarter of 2021, while in the full year average of 2021 was
approximately 42% higher for NBSK and approximately 49% higher for BHKP than 2020. Similarly, the
market for recovered paper took an unexpectedly strong upward turn during the entire year of 2021. Even
more severe for the lower grades, which were coming from extremely low, partly negative, price levels at the
beginning of 2020, our preferred white middle grades showed significant price increases during the course of
2021, as collection rates had not recovered from a COVID-19 pandemic-related drop and the scarce supply
met a strong demand from all sectors. By the fourth quarter of 2021, our average purchase price per ton for
recovered paper had increased by about 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, whereas the full year
average price per ton we paid during 2021 was approximately 30% higher than in 2020.


-----

By the beginning of 2022, the disruption of global supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had
improved the order books of the European paper industry on the back of lower imports from Asia, and the
related demand for pulp in Europe met a once again limited supply cause by, among other factors,
transportation issues. These COVID-19-related factors coincided with several additional extraordinary
developments, setting the stage for another unexpected and unprecedented rally in pulp prices during almost
the entire year in 2022. Those developments included a long-lasting strike at one major pulp producer in
Europe, the impact of the Russian war against Ukraine on cross-border wood trades and availability of freight
capacity and climate-related production losses on the Iberian peninsula. During the first nine month of 2022,
prices for softwood pulp increased by U.S. $236 or 19%, whereas prices for hardwood increased by the same
amount (21%) within just the first six months of 2022. By the end of 2022, prices for softwood pulp were
approximately 13% higher than by end 2021, and prices for hardwood pulp increased by approximately 21%.
The full year averages were about 17% higher for NBSK and 27% higher for BHKP. The availability of certain
recovered paper grades was another dominating factor throughout 2022, with the COVID-19 pandemic
resulting in changes in office working (and printing) patterns that led to low collection rates of, in particular,
Sorted Office Paper and accelerating the secular decline of the graphic printing and writing sector. At the
margin, availability of middle and better grades was also impacted by the tight pulp market. Nevertheless, the
prices for recovered paper initially remained stable, and in some cases even decreased slightly at the beginning
of 2022, following the steep increase in prices towards the end of 2021. However, beginning in the second
quarter of 2022, recovered paper prices increased sharply, peaking in July 2022, before collapsing again during
the second half of 2022, with some of the poor-quality grades even falling below the costs of collection. The
average prices for recovered paper fell by approximately 20% from the third to the fourth quarter of 2022,
with prices in the fourth quarter of 2022 approximately 11% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Nevertheless, average prices for recovered paper during the full year 2022 were still approximately 22% higher
than during 2021.

Market prices at the beginning of 2023 were still influenced by supply disruptions. However, pulp availability
started to improve significantly during the first quarter of 2023 as supply chain disruptions related to the
COVID-19 pandemic were resolved and additional pulp capacity hit the market. At the same time, demand
for pulp from the global, and specifically the European, paper industry deteriorated significantly. This quickly
led to pulp supply exceeding demand and, as a result, to a significant shift in market sentiment in the pulp
market. While prices for softwood pulp already started to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2022, prices for
hardwood pulp started to fall from record highs from February 2023 onwards. While the supply situation on
the market for softwood pulp was not as strong as for hardwood pulp, prices for softwood pulp were still
dragged down by the significant excess supply in the market for hardwood pulp. During the third quarter of
2023, demand for pulp from Asia slowly started to grow from low levels, which led to a reversal in the price
trend for pulp in the Asian market. However, pulp prices in Europe continued to decline during the entire
third quarter. By the end of the third quarter of 2023, prices for softwood pulp were approximately 19.8 %
lower than by the end of 2022, and prices for hardwood pulp decreased by approximately 40.6%. As with
pulp, weak demand for paper products also affected prices in the market for recovered paper. Even though
availability of recovered paper was not good with respect to absolute tons sold, it was still good enough to
exceed the demand for higher grades of recovered paper, which significantly impacted market prices. While
the impact on different grades of recovered paper varied based on varying market dynamics and timing, the
market for recovered paper generally experienced a significant downward correction during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 from the record levels seen during the summer of 2022. The average purchase
price per ton we paid for recovered paper during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was
approximately 30% lower than during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022.

Historically, we have only been partially successful in passing the full costs of increased raw material prices on
to our customers. Since many of our customer contracts do not provide for automatic price adjustments,
there is typically a time lag between the time of any increases in underlying raw material costs and the time at
which we are able to renegotiate the prices our customers pay for our finished tissue products. Our sales
volumes are mainly subject to framework agreements with our retail customers, which allow those customers
to place orders “on demand” at prices that are fixed for the duration of the agreement. Although these
agreements generally do not contain minimum purchase obligations, we are in regular dialogue with our
customers and normally have reasonable visibility over sales volumes for the upcoming year. See, however,
“Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” above for the
unprecedented volatility in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To allow us to respond more quickly
to the extraordinary and ongoing volatility of our input costs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war
in Ukraine, we negotiated significantly shorter contract cycles with many of our customers of approximately
3 to 4 months, compared to historic contract cycles of up to 12 to 18 months, although we have since extended
the duration of contracts again with certain of our customers to 3 to 6 months. With certain customers for


-----

which we are a “concept supplier”, in particular, we have also entered into longer-term agreements that contain
adaptive/index pricing mechanisms. See also “Business—Our Strategy—Partner of Choice for Our Customers”.

In order to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the price of pulp, our main raw material and largest purchasing
cost item, we have developed a specific hedging strategy which involves a multistage process designed to
separately address (i) fluctuations in the market price of pulp, as quoted in U.S. dollars as well as
(ii) fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the euro, our reporting currency and the
currency in which we generate most of our sales revenues.

Our Procurement department continuously monitors the market price development for pulp and, in close
coordination with our Treasury department and the newly introduced resilience management, typically tries
to lock in pulp prices (as quoted in U.S. dollars) with regard to up to two thirds of our projected pulp
requirements over a rolling 12 to 18-month period. We satisfy the balance of our pulp requirements at
prevailing market prices and by using spot opportunities.

Our Treasury department separately hedges our projected Group-wide U.S. dollar requirements, which
primarily relate to pulp purchases. Under the relevant internal Treasury guidelines, we try to lock in exchange
rates with regard to our projected U.S. dollar requirements on a rolling basis through a variety of different
hedging instruments, in particular through the use of forward contracts and options. In doing so, we take a
staggered approach, pursuant to which we hedge approximately 75% of our projected U.S. dollar requirements
over a rolling 12-month period (with up to 90% being hedged for the immediate short-term). We hedge a
lower percentage of our projected U.S. dollar requirements for periods more than 12 months in the future. We
satisfy the balance of our U.S. dollar requirements through the spot market.

Unlike for pulp, there are no derivative instruments available that would allow us to hedge our exposure to
fluctuations in the prices of the recovered paper grades we require. The only way to lock in recovered paper
prices is therefore via direct agreements with our recovered paper suppliers, which is regularly possible for
periods up to 3-4 months.

See also “Business—Our Strategy—Strong Commitment to Sustainability” below, on our efforts to strengthen
our operational and environmental resilience by investing in circular economy business models and
diversifying our fiber portfolio, including through new fiber product innovations based on miscanthus-based
and OCC-based tissue paper.

**Exposure to Fluctuations in Energy Prices**

Our production processes, in particular the production of de-inked pulp and the operation of our paper
machines, require large amounts of energy, in the form of electricity, natural gas and steam. Energy expenses
were our second largest procurement cost item in 2022 after the cost for pulp and amounted to €263.8 million,
or 24.2%, of our total cost of materials in 2022, €116.3 million, or 16.3%, in 2021, €76.8 million, or 11.3%, in
2020, and €172.7 million, or 22.2%, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

The key drivers of our energy expenses are fluctuations of the market prices for energy, as well as regulatory
decisions. Our total energy expenses have increased during recent years, primarily as a result of higher
production capacities and rising market prices for electricity and natural gas. However, the volatility and
sharp increases in energy prices we experienced during 2021 and 2022, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the war in Ukraine, were unprecedented.

In 2021, we experienced a previously unprecedented increase in energy market prices, a trend which accelerated
in the fourth quarter of 2021, i.e. even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In particular,
natural gas, power, carbon emission allowances, crude oil and coal showed extreme gains and reached all-time
highs. Based on increased demand, deployed gas storages and concerns about sufficient supplies for the winter
season, spot prices for gas reached peak levels just before the holiday season and more than doubled during
the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the start of the quarter, before falling back to their starting levels at
the end of 2021. Forward gas prices for supply in 2022 also doubled during the fourth quarter of 2021, before
dropping sharply at the end of the quarter to close approximately 50% above the price levels during the third
quarter of 2021, with markets expecting an improving supply situation for gas in the longer term. Prices for
carbon certificates also more than doubled during 2021. Market prices for electricity followed the trend for
gas and carbon and were additionally supported by concerns in relation to the reliability of the French nuclear
fleet as new security checks were announced by the responsible authorities. Electricity prices peaked just
before the Christmas holidays, with spot prices more than doubling compared to the start of the fourth
quarter of 2021, before falling again sharply at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Forward electricity


-----

prices for delivery in 2022 also dropped, but remained approximately 50% above electricity price levels at the
end of the third quarter of 2021.

Throughout 2022, global energy markets were strongly impacted by reduced supplies following the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, but other factors that impacted global energy prices in 2022 included the reopening of
China’s economy following the lifting of the rigid COVID-19 measures, rumors about OPEC’s exploration
strategy, general economic sluggishness and rising interest rates. Forward gas prices for delivery in 2023
reached a high of six times higher than January 2022 and in the fourth quarter of 2022 ended up approximately
50% higher than corresponding price in January 2022. Prices for carbon certificates in in the fourth quarter
2022 ended up at the same price levels they started at the beginning of 2022. Electricity prices followed the
trend for fuels and carbon with forward electricity prices for delivery in 2023 reaching a high of almost ten
times higher than in January 2023 and ending up slightly higher than corresponding prices at the beginning of
2022.

During the first half of 2023, prices for crude oil were volatile, but at levels comparable to those before the
Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, a combination of factors that included increasing demand, limited
global exploration, comparably low storage levels, hopes for a pause in the US Federal Reserve System`s (Fed)
interest rate hikes and fears about further OPEC+ exploration cuts led to a significant increase in crude oil
prices in the third quarter of 2023. Despite of significant reduced Norwegian pipeline gas flows due to
scheduled maintenance work overall gas supply was still comfortable. Sufficient LNG supplies and continued
subdued demand reduced supply risks for the winter season and resulted in gas storage levels which were well
above the regulatory requirements and the last five -years-average. While European CO2 prices increased in a
volatile market environment during the first quarter of 2023, prices remained broadly stable during the second
quarter of 2023 and declined during the third quarter, while remaining highly volatile. Electricity generation
was sufficient during the first nine months of 2023, and in combination with moderate weather conditions,
spot market prices for electricity declined during the first two quarters of 2023 and remained broadly stable
during the third quarter at normal volatility levels. As the outlook for industrial demand remains subdued
and the gas storage situation has further improved, forward prices for power came under significant pressure.
Prices for next year supply declined significantly especially for Germany and for France as expected availability
of French nuclear plants has improved. The Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel at the beginning of
October 2023 and the ongoing hostilities have raised concerns about a further escalation of the conflict and
lifted all energy market prices in the short term, although market prices for energy have already fallen again.
As the supply of oil and gas was not significantly impacted as of the date of this offering memorandum, price
levels were almost back to pre-conflict levels, although the risk of new price increases certainly remains high.

In particular, in our core market of Germany, energy prices have also been strongly impacted by regulatory
decisions related to the so-called “energy transition” (Energiewende). This revised energy policy focuses on
promoting the development of renewable energy sources, resulted in the complete cessation of the production
of nuclear power by early 2023 and will also lead to a gradual reduction of coal fired power generation to
reach the German carbon reduction targets. Similar policies are being implemented at an EU level. To mitigate
the impact of the significant upwards pressure on electricity prices for energy-intensive industries, the German
Government (as well as other national governments) adopted rules that provided for various businesses,
including the Wepa Group, to be reimbursed for certain infrastructure investment surcharges necessary for
the implementation of the “Energiewende”. As the relevant rules have already been modified several times in
the past we expect further modifications and challenging conditions to continue to benefit from current
accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks
_related to our Business—If the cost of key raw materials and energy increases, we may not be able to pass these_
_increased costs on to our customers in full”._

We attempt to limit our exposure to the volatility of electricity and gas prices through structurally adaptive
risk management measures as well as by covering parts of our projected energy requirements through fixed
future contracts. These contracts are entered into by different entities within the Wepa Group, mostly at the
local level, and have varying starting dates and durations. We usually take a staggered approach, pursuant to
which we hedge approximately 0% to 90% of our projected requirements over a 36-month period. In Italy, we
are part of an industrial syndicate which manages energy supply issues and the related regulatory issues for its
members. This includes locking in prices for a portion of projected energy requirements in coordination
between all syndicate members subject to market price developments. At our site in Giershagen, Germany,
approximately 33% of our electric power and almost 100% of our steam requirements for this site are provided
by Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH (“WKG”), a subsidiary of the Issuer operating a power plant which uses the
residual materials from our recycling processes in Arnsberg and Giershagen as a source of thermal energy.

**Exposure to Fluctuations in Freight/Logistics Costs**

Our production operations require us to coordinate and monitor complex logistics processes between each
step of our internal value chain and our production processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and
products. This includes the shipment of jumbo reels between production sites as well as the shipment of our
finished products to our customers. We meet our freight and logistics requirements mainly through the use of
external logistics companies. Due to the relatively large size and weight of our products compared to value,
freight and logistics expenses play an important role in our business, and fluctuations in freight prices can
have a significant impact on our profitability.

The continuous optimization of our logistics flows and freight costs has therefore been, and will continue to
be a key focus supply of our investment program. See “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results
_of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” above with regard to the special logistics challenges as well as limited_
availability of pallets and freight capacity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Exposure to Exchange Rate Fluctuations**

Given the growing geographic spread of our operations, we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange
rate fluctuations. We are particularly exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Polish zloty and the
British pound to the euro. For the first nine months ended September 30, 2023, 4.6% and 14.2% of our total
sales derived from sales in Polish zloty and British pounds, respectively. As a result of our recent investments
into a new paper machine and a new converting line at our production site in Piechowice, Poland as well as
our investments into our newest paper machine in Bridgend, United Kingdom, our exposure to both Polish
zloty and British pounds has increased further. Considering the expected growth rates of the British tissue
market as well as our plans to continue developing and optimizing our operations at our Bridgend site, we
expect our exposure in British pounds, in particular, to gradually increase over the coming years. See also
“—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment
_Program; Sustainable Capacity Management” above._

We proactively monitor and assess the development of the exchange rates of the Polish zloty and the British
pound against the euro, and we have implemented adaptive risk management measures with regard to our
related exchange rate risks. Currently, we target a staggered hedge ratio from 0.0% to 80.0% of our exposure
to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the Polish zloty derived from our projected PLN revenues
over a 30-month period. A similar policy is also applied to the hedging of exchange rate fluctuations between
the euro and the British pound. To track the effectiveness of our risk management we have implemented
several controlling and reporting instruments, which enable us to routinely analyze our overall hedging
strategy. We do not currently hedge our exposure related to the PLN-denominated intra-group loans to our
Polish subsidiary, but intend to regularly re-evaluate this policy based on an ongoing assessment of any further
volatility in the exchange rate of the Polish zloty against euro.

Even if we do take further hedging measures in the future, there can be no guarantee that such measures will
be effective. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Polish zloty, the British pound or other local currencies
against the euro have had, and may increasingly have in the future, a significant effect on our operations and
on our reported results in euro, and the comparability of our performance between financial periods can be
significantly affected by fluctuations in local currencies against the euro.

In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar can also have a significant
impact on our profitability. While the prices of some of our raw materials such as pulp and oil (which affect
our energy costs, freight costs and auxiliary costs such as packaging materials) are quoted in U.S. dollars in
international markets, we primarily generate our sales revenues in euros, Polish zloty and British pound.
Therefore, a weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to these currencies will generally have a positive impact
on our results, while a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these currencies will generally have a negative
impact on our results.

Assuming a hypothetical pulp price of U.S.$600 per ton and an exchange rate of U.S.$1.10 per €1.00, a
fluctuation in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and the euro by U.S.$0.01 would result in a price increase or
decrease of approximately €4.96 per ton of pulp. Given that we consumed approximately 572,000 tons of
pulp in 2022, each U.S.$0.01 in exchange rate movement would have had an impact on our purchasing costs
for pulp of approximately €2.84 million, assuming we had not hedged our exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations. For information on our U.S. dollar-related hedging measures, see “—Exposure to Fluctuations in
_Pulp and Recovered Paper Prices”._

**Expansion Projects and Investment Program; Sustainable Capacity Management**

Sharply rising raw material and freight costs and high energy prices not only pose a challenge for our Group,
but for our entire industry. We are therefore convinced that the continuous, incremental strategic development
of our asset base remains key to our continued success as a leading, cost efficient tissue producer in Europe.
This involves targeted expansion investments and sustainable capacity management measures intended to
drive further cost reductions, portfolio optimization, efficiency improvements and active working capital
management. To further strengthen our market position and competitiveness as the third largest producer in
the European tissue paper market and as part of our sustainable capacity management, we therefore
implemented a number of strategic capital expenditure projects between 2020 and 2023, notwithstanding the
special challenges we faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. This included the
decision to invest in two new paper machines at our sites in Piechowice, Poland and Bridgend, United
Kingdom as well as in new converting lines at our manufacturing sites in Piechowice, Swalmen, Bridgend,
Giershagen, Lille, Troyes, Leuna and Kriebstein. In total, our capital expenditures amounted to €95.5 million
in 2020, €123.8 million in 2021, €61.6 million in 2022 and €35.1 in the first nine months of 2023. These
amounts included (i) investments in our two newest paper machines in Piechowice, Poland and Bridgend,
United Kingdom of €41.5 million in 2020, €57.8 million in 2021, €20.8 million in 2022 and €1.7 million in the
first nine months of 2023, (ii) investments in new converting capacities and stock preparation projects of
€19.4 million in 2020, €49.7 million in 2021, €25.0 million in 2022 and €8.4 in the first nine months of 2023, as
well as (iii) maintenance capital expenditures of €34.7 million in 2020, €16.3 million in 2021, €15.7 million in
2022 and €25.0 in the first nine months of 2023.

We started up our new paper machine and two new converting lines at our plant in Piechowice, Poland at the
end of September 2021. The new paper machine, which can process pulp as well as up to 100% recovered fiber,
replaced an old crepe machine we dismantled in the autumn of 2020. With an average operating capacity of
approximately 34,000 tons per year, the new paper machine increased the output of our manufacturing site at
Piechowice to approximately 65,000 tons of raw paper per year, strengthening our Professional business unit
and its market base in Eastern Europe. In addition, we commissioned two new converting lines for paper
towels and toilet paper at our site at Piechowice. These investments led to further improvements in machine
efficiency, sustainability and cost reduction, with regard to energy, raw materials and maintenance. Our total
investments into the new paper machine and two converting lines at Piechowice amounted to a combined
total of €41.5 million between 2020 and 2022.

Our newest paper machine at Bridgend, United Kingdom, with state-of-the-art technology and a planned
annual production capacity of 65,000 tons, commenced production in June 2022, more than doubling our
tissue paper production capacity in the United Kingdom and creating more than 50 new jobs. Despite Brexit,
the United Kingdom remains an important growth market for us, and the investment in state-of-the-art
technology is an important part of our strategy for “future-proofing” our business. We believe that the
increased tissue paper production capacity and modern technology of our new paper machine will enable us
to meet the expectations of our customers with regard to product quality, sustainability, reliability and cost
leadership even better. With the startup of our new paper machine in Bridgend, United Kingdom, we
eliminated the need to purchase jumbo reels in the UK market. We believe this positions us well for potential
future growth of our business in the UK and generally significantly strengthens our competitive position in
the UK market, in addition to achieving significant savings in energy, raw material and maintenance costs. We
see a potential to establish a clear leadership platform for Private Label quality in the UK market and at the
same time the possibility to move the Group into the lowest quartile cost segment in the UK, making our
business cost competitive across all quality segments. Our total investment into the new paper machine at
Bridgend, United Kingdom, amounted to a combined total of €96.9 million complemented by a €14.9 million
investment into two new converting lines between 2020 and 2023.

To be the partner of choice for our customers, we may make additional investments to expand and strengthen
our regional footprint, either in the form of investment into new or expanded production facilities or
opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions. Due to the consolidation amongst European retail groups, it has become
even more important that we can supply our customers across their respective markets. We want to be able to
offer our customers customized solutions for their own brands in all markets they operate within, including
bespoke specifications, qualities and price mechanisms. We therefore continue to carefully assess potential
bolt-on acquisitions from time to time, not only to be able to match the pan-European footprints of our
customers, but also to potentially acquire attractive customer bases, to further broaden our portfolio and/or
to leverage our asset base. See also “Business—Strategy—Partner of Choice for our Customers”. To meet our
sustainability goals, including environmental protection, fiber diversification, increased competitiveness,
regulatory compliance, and to take advantage of sustainable growth opportunities, we further plan to develop
an investment roadmap to identify how we can “future proof” our business, for example, by (i) increasing our


-----

use of renewable energy and reducing our reliance on conventional sources of energy, in particular gas,
(ii) improving and securing our access to “future fibers” and/or (iii) by further integrating circular economy
aspects into our production processes and product life cycles. See also “Business—Continuous Striving for
_Efficiency through Cost and Technology Leadership” above. In this regard, we expect to benefit from proposed_
future investments outside the Group by our Parent in complementary business areas such as renewable
energy, alternative fibers and circular economy business models.

In an opportunistic transaction that allowed us to acquire additional hygiene paper volumes with existing
Wepa customers, we further acquired the former Victor Güthoff Group, including 55 employees, in
October 2020 and integrated the hygiene paper activities of the acquired business, which represented the vast
part of the activities of the Victor Güthoff Group, into our existing organization. We then rebranded the
remaining business activities of the former Victor Güthoff Group “WEPA Category Solutions” with a view
to potentially retaining them and diversifying our business by offering our customers a broader range of select
products in the cleaning, foil and packaging sector, such as wipes, cleaning cloths for glasses, biodegradable
waste bags and cling bags. However, we are currently in the process of disposing of some of these non-core
activities, in particular an aluminum foil business.

On June 1, 2023, we acquired a stock preparation unit (used for the preparation of de-inked pulp from
recovered paper) located in close proximity to our tissue paper manufacturing site in Kriebstein, Germany
from the insolvent Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH. In addition to the asset acquisition,
we also took on 40 employees from Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH. Our
manufacturing site in Kriebstein is our European competence center for folded products. By integrating the
newly acquired stock preparation into our operations at Kriebstein, we believe we have generated synergies
for our manufacturing sites at Kriebstein and Leuna (Germany) and Piechowice (Poland) with regard to
efficiency and cost savings, as well as increased flexibility for the Group. With this latest investment, we believe
we further strengthen our strategic orientation and focus on sustainability as well as our long-term competitive
position. The purchase price for this acquisition amounted to €3.6 million.

**KEY STATEMENT OF INCOME ITEMS**

The following is a description of certain line items in our consolidated results of operations.

**Sales**

Sales include income derived from the sale of finished products both in our Consumer business unit and in
our Professional business unit as well as income from the sale of semi-finished products such as jumbo reels
and de-inked pulp. We report sales as sales in Germany and foreign sales revenue, respectively, based on the
invoicing entity within the Wepa Group. As a result, this geographic split does not reflect the location of our
customers or the location of production. Sales also reflect sales reductions like bonuses, cash discounts to
customers or advertising subsidies.

**Increase or decrease of inventory of finished and semi-finished products**

Our increase or decrease of inventory of finished and semi-finished products records the change in stocks of
finished and semi-finished products at manufacturing cost. The manufacturing costs include direct material
and labor costs as well as material and production overheads allocated proportionally on the assumption of
normal utilization of production capacity.

**Other internally produced and capitalized assets**

Other internally produced and capitalized assets during the periods under review relate to the construction of
our newest paper machine at our manufacturing site in Bridgend, United Kingdom. In connection with the
implementation of this latest paper machine project, several employees from Wepa UK Ltd., from Wepa
entities other than Wepa UK Ltd. as well as external consultants assisted with the implementation of the
project, and we capitalized the related costs.

**Other operating income**

Other operating income consists of all income from business activities not already recognized under other
income items. Other operating income includes, among other items, income from the release of provisions,
income from insurance refunds from damage events and income from the disposal of assets. In addition,
other operating income includes income from other periods (e.g. reimbursements in relation to energy matters


-----

as well as an appreciation in value of current assets related to our spare part inventories) and income from
exchange rate differences.

**Costs of materials**

The costs of materials consist of cost of raw materials, supplies and purchased goods such as pulp and
recovered paper, costs of chemicals, costs for auxiliary material as well as pallet costs. It also includes
third-party service costs (including energy used, cost of waste disposal and maintenance) and purchased
goods.

**Personnel expense**

Personnel expense includes all expenses for wages and salaries (including bonuses) and other employment
benefits, contributions to pension plans and social security contributions. Personnel costs also include the
costs of redundancy and partial retirement agreements.

**Other operating expenses**

Other operating expenses primarily include freight costs, expenses for external labor and other third party
services, expenses from exchange rate differences, expenses for management services from Wepa SE, expenses
from other periods, IT cost, legal and auditing charges as well as expenses for insurance, mandatory
contributions to the German recycling scheme (Grüner Punkt), security services, rent and leasing. Other
operating expenses may also include extraordinary items that consist of business activities outside our core
business activities and which have an exceptional importance and/or result in exceptional amounts. Freight
costs consist primarily of transportation costs to our customers and company internal transfers of finished
and semi-finished goods, but also include warehouse costs.

**Amortization and depreciation**

We incur expense for amortization and depreciation of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
as a result of both scheduled depreciation and impairment losses on these assets. Amortization and
depreciation are usually charged on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the assets.

**Interest income/(expenses), net**

Interest income/(expenses), net includes income from loans under financial assets, other interest and similar
income, interest and similar expenses as well as income from disposal of financial assets and amortization of
financial assets. Interest and similar expenses primarily include interest expense and other financing costs
related to the Existing Notes, long-term loans, short-term bank liabilities, bank and bank guarantee provisions
and transaction costs for our ABS Program.

**Taxes**

Taxes comprise income taxes such as trade taxes, corporate taxes, foreign taxes and deferred taxes as well as
other taxes, such as taxes on substance (mainly real estate taxes in France and Italy) and energy taxes.

See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

**_Sales_**

Total sales increased by €228.7 million, or 19.8%, from €1,153.3 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 to €1,382.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This increase in
total sales was primarily attributable to the carry-over of incremental price increases which we negotiated with
our customers during the course of 2022, based on the substantial cost increases for input materials, especially
energy, during the course of 2022. See also “Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Exposure to
_Fluctuations in Pulp and Recovered Paper Prices”, “—Exposure to Fluctuations in Energy Prices” and_
“—Exposure to Fluctuations in Freight/Logistics Costs” above. During the first nine months ended
September 30, 2023, the average sales price of our finished products was approximately 21.2% higher
compared to the average sales price during the first nine months ended September 30, 2022, even though sales
prices did start to decline throughout 2023 following recent input price decreases, albeit with a significant
time lag. In addition, sales volumes of finished products increased by 17,000 tons, or 3.2%, from 524,000 tons
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to 541,000 tons in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023, due to a growth in customer demand in both our Consumer and Professional
business units. External sales volumes of semi-finished products decreased by about 14,000 tons, or 21%, from
67,000 tons in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to 53,000 tons in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023, primarily because of higher internal needs in converting of finished products and
a reduced demand for de-inked pulp from the graphic paper industry.

The following table sets forth our sales by geographic markets:

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, sales in Germany accounted for 34.9% of total sales,
therefore presenting a stable share compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022. Sales in
Germany increased by €79.7 million, or 19.8%, from €402.4 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 to €482.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. In addition, foreign
sales increased by €149.1 million, or 19.9%, from €750.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022 to €899.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Developments in Germany and
foreign sales markets both primarily relate to the continuation of higher average sales prices for our finished
products in 2023 based on price increases we negotiated in 2022 due to inflation in input costs, as described
above. In addition, sales volumes of finished products in Germany increased by 3.2%, or 6,000 tons, from
200,000 tons in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to 206,000 tons in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023, while foreign sales volumes increased by 4.1%, or 13,000 tons, from 324,000 tons
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to 337,000 tons in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023.

The following table sets forth the sales of our Consumer and Professional business units as well as our sales of
semi-finished products to third parties:

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, sales of our Consumer and Professional business units
as well as our sales of semi-finished products accounted for 80.5%, 13.9% and 5.7%, respectively, of total
sales, compared to 75.6%, 15.0% and 9.4%, respectively, of total sales in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022. Sales of our Consumer business unit increased by €239.9 million, or 27.5%, from
€872.1 million in in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €1,112.0 million in in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023, while sales of our Professional business unit increased by €18.3 million, or
10.6%, from €173.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €191.5 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and our sales of semi-finished products decreased by
€29.4 million, or 27.3%, from €108.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to
€78.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, for the reasons described above.

Our inventory of finished and semi-finished products decreased by €5.4 million in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023 compared to an increase of €53.5 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the decline in value of our finished
and semi-finished product inventories reflected deflation in the prices for input factors, whereas the volumes
of our inventories of both finished and semi-finished products changed only slightly in the normal course of
business. In contrast, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, we deliberately built up our stocks
of finished product to return to target levels after a demand peak toward the end of 2021. In addition, we
made a strategic decision in 2022 to reduce sales of semi-finished products to third parties to enable us to
increase our inventory of jumbo reels as a hedge against anticipated disruptions to production related to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the possibility of a gas embargo and gas shortages during the winter
period of 2022. Our finished and semi-finished inventories comprised positive valuation effects resulting from
inflated market prices in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022. Generally, our inventory levels are
influenced by both short-term factors, such as special promotion measures and inventory management


-----

measures taken by our key customers, and long-term factors, such as increases or decrease in sales as well as
expansion projects and our investment program.

ended September 30, 2022 to €15.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 mainly due to
a decrease in income from exchange rate differences of €9.5 million, or 78.7%, from €12.1 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €2.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023. This significant decrease more than offset increases of (i) income related to other periods by €2.0 million,
or 71.4% from €2.8 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €4.8 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, and (ii) income from release of provisions by €4.5 million,
from €0.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €4.6 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in income from exchange rate difference mainly related to
lower currency gains from PLN and GBP based business transactions and corresponds to a decrease in
expenses from currency exchange included in other operating expenses. Income related to other periods
increased mainly due to credit notes on energy in Germany, partly related to our acquisition of the stock
preparation unit of insolvent Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH, completed in June 2023.
In addition, income from value adjustment on receivables increased by €1.4 million, from €0.1 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €1.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023 due to reduced utilization of our ABS Program. Other operating income also comprises a regular income
from release of difference from capital consolidation of €1.6 million in the nine-month period ended 2021 and
2022 related to the integration of the former Greenfield plant of the French Arjowiggins Group in
Château-Thierry, France (now: WEPA Greenfield SAS) in March 2019.

Cost of materials decreased substantially by €23.5 million, or 2.9%, from €800.0 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022 (69.4% of sales, or 66.3% of total operating performance) to €776.5 million
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 (56.2% of sales, or 56.4% of total operating performance)
due to decreases in the market prices of our main input costs, especially for recovered paper and energy.

The decrease in the cost of raw materials, supplies and purchased goods by €4.6 million, or 0.89%, from
€567.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €562.9 million in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023, mainly resulted from a substantial decrease in our recovered paper costs by 29.0%
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022, following a significant decrease in the average price per ton for recovered paper in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023. This price decrease more than off-sets additional recovered paper
consumption mainly related to our asset acquisition of the stock preparation unit of Kübler & Niethammer
Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH, completed in June 2023. In addition, cost for finished and semi-finished


-----

trading goods decreased by €12.4 million and €9.4 million, respectively, in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. However, costs for pulp increased by € 26.7 million, or 9.9%, from €270.6 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €297.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
20223, and packaging costs also increased slightly by €2.6 million, or 3.9%, from €67.6 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €70.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023, the latter mainly as a result of our increased converting output. As a percentage of our total operating
performance, cost of raw materials, supplies and purchased goods decreased by 6.1%, as our sales remained
very strong due to a mostly stable sales pricing for our finished products during the first half year of 2023,
with downwards adjustments of the sales prices for our products (in response to decreases in the market prices
for our input materials that started in the fourth quarter of 2022) only becoming more substantial during the
third quarter of 2023.

The average pulp price per ton we paid in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 increased by
6.7%, from €627 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €669 in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023, mainly due to a substantial positive impact from pulp hedging in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2022, while an adverse impact from pulp hedging is included in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023, largely because of the built of provisions for impending losses on existing pulp
hedges, resulting in increasing pulp costs of €17.8 million. Meanwhile the average price for recovered paper
decreased by 30.4% from €263 per ton in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €183 per ton in
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, leading to a recovered paper cost decrease of €24.1 million.
See also “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Exposure to Fluctuations in Pulp and Recovered
_Paper Prices”above. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our consumption of pulp increased_
slightly by 3,000 tons compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to
additional pulp consumption as a result of the start-up of our newest paper machine in Bridgend, United
Kingdom in June 2022, which resulted in increased pulp costs of €2.0 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. Our consumption of recovered paper increased by 7,000 tons in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023, mainly related to our asset acquisition of the stock preparation unit of Kübler &
Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH. The higher consumption resulted in additional recovered paper
costs of €1.9 million.

Third-party service costs decreased by €18.9 million, or 8.1%, in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023, from €232.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €213.7 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in energy expenses by €26.6 million,
or 13.3%, from €199.3 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €172.7 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Cost for electricity decreased by €3.2 million, or 3.7%, from
€88.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €84.7 million in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023. Cost for gas decreased by €17.2 million, or 19.6%, from €87.7 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €70.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023, and cost for steam decreased by €9.8 million, or 44.6%, from €22.0 million in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2022 to €12.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. These
decreases in costs were partially offset by a €6.1 million increase in maintenance service cost to €25.6 million
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 and a €1.9 million increase in disposal cost in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to €13.5 million (primarily related to (i) a shift in our recovered
paper fiber mix towards more lower-grade fiber input and (ii) our asset acquisition of the stock preparation
unit of Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH) in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023.

-----

€3.6 million, or 11.2% increase in social security contributions and retirement and assistance costs. This
increase was primarily due to salary increases under collective bargaining arrangements and a moderate
growth in headcount, predominantly among factory workers, also related to our asset acquisition of the stock
preparation unit of the Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH June 2023. The increase in
salaries and wages of 12.5% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022, compared to an increase of 2.7% in the average number of employees from
3,775 employees in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to 3,877 employees in the nine-month

need in converting especially in Germany and France. The number of administrative employees increased by
35, or 3.4%, from 1,017 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to 1,052 in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023 mainly due to new positions in our strategic areas, e.g. eCommerce, Energy & Fiber

Other operating expenses slightly decreased overall by €2.7 million, or 1.4%, from €190.5 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €187.8 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in expenses from exchange rate differences of
€11.2 million, or 76.9%, from €14.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €3.3 million
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to transactions in Polish Złoty and British
Pounds, including both realized and unrealized exchange rate losses, the latter in relation to the conversion of
foreign currency balance sheet liabilities into the relevant reporting currency. The decrease in expenses from
exchange rate differences was largely offset by a corresponding decrease in income from exchange rate
differences during the same period as described under “other operating income” above. In addition, expenses
from other periods decreased by €1.5 million, or 33.8%, from €4.3 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 to €2.8 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Despite the higher
sales volume to our customers in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our cost of freight
decreased slightly by €0.6 million, from €94.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to


-----

€93.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 due to higher availability and lower prices
for truck transportation. Extraordinary expenses of €3.9 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 mainly related to the 2022 Cyber Attack and the successful refinancing of our ABS
Program. IT costs increased by €1.7 million, or 30.5%, from €5.7 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 to €7.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, mainly as a result of
our continuing focus on digitalization and automatization of operating processes, and legal and auditing
charges increased by €1.5 million, from €4.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to
€5.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in “others” of €8.8 million, or
31.8%, from €27.8 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €36.6 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, mainly reflects an increase of €1.3 million to €3.4 million in
other sales related expenses, an increase of €1.0 million to €2.7 million in advertisement cost, an increase of
€0.7 million to €1.5 million in travelling cost as well as expenses related to the celebration of our 75-year
corporate anniversary of €1.3 million.

Our EBITDA increased by €172.7 million, or 272.6%, from €63.4 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 (€67.3 million, if adjusted for the extraordinary expenses described under “other operating
expenses” above) to €236.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the
factors described above. Our EBITDA margin (i.e. EBITDA as a percentage of our total operating

nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €45.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023. This increase is primarily the result of a €1.9 million, or 4.6% increase in depreciation on tangible assets,
mainly as a result of our recent strategic investments, such as our new paper machines at our manufacturing
sites in Piechowice, Poland and Bridgend, United Kingdom, as well as our investment into several new
converting lines. For more detail, see “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—
_Expansion Projects and Investment Program; Sustainable Capacity Management” above. The decrease of_
€0.3 million of amortization on intangible assets from €3.0 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 to €2.7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was mainly due to
lower depreciation of goodwill.

the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to net interest expenses of €20.8 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher interest and similar expenses of
€7.4 million, or 40.4%, from €18.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €25.6 million
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, driven by higher interest expenses related to our ABS
Program and expenses from interest rate swaps.

The increase of interests and similar expenses was partly offset by a €4.1 million increase in other interests and
similar income, from €0.6 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €4.7 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, due to interest income from our interest rate swaps.

increased by €12.9 million, from €0.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to
€12.7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, and corporate taxes increased by
€18.1 million, from €4.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to €22.1 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, both driven by our improved operating result in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023. Deferred taxes changed from a deferred tax income of €2.6 million in 2022
to a deferred tax expense of €3.3 million in 2023, primarily due to tax loss carry-forwards in our French
subsidiary and accruals for impending losses from hedging.

Other taxes decreased by €0.4 million from €8.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022
to €8.0 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower energy tax and
non-income tax related to previous periods, partly compensated by higher real estate tax in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023.

**_Sales_**

Total sales increased significantly by €430.5 million, or 35.7%, from €1,205.9 million in 2021 to
€1,636.4 million in 2022. This significant increase in total sales was primarily attributable to multiple,
incremental price increases for our finished and semi-finished products we managed to negotiate with our
customers and implement in response to significant market-driven price increases for our main inputs,
especially energy prices. See also “Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Exposure to Fluctuations
_in Energy Prices”and “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Russia-Ukraine_
_Conflict, Supply Shortages and Cost Inflation” above. As a result, the average sales price of finished products_
increased by 34.4% in 2022 compared to 2021, the average sales price of jumbo reels increased by 66.0% and
the average sales price for de-inked pulp by 14.3%. Total sales volume of finished products increased by 26,000
tons or 3.8%, from 681,000 tons in 2021 to 707,000 tons in 2022, mainly due to a normalization in demand in
both our Consumer and Professional business units, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic slowly
receding during the course of 2022. See also “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of
_Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” above. However, sales in 2022 were also negatively impacted by volume_
losses of approximately 20,000 tons as a consequence of technical delivery issues caused by a 2022 Cyber
Attack. In addition, sales volumes of semi-finished products decreased by 37,000 tons or 32.2%, from 115,000
tons in 2021 to 78,000 tons in 2022, as we made a strategic decision to reduce sales of semi-finished products
to third parties to enable us to increase our inventory of jumbo reels as a hedge against anticipated disruptions
to production related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the possibility of a gas embargo and gas
shortages during the winter period of 2022.

In 2022, sales in Germany accounted for 35.1% of total sales compared to 33.4% of total sales in 2021. Sales
in Germany increased by €171.8 million, or 42.6%, from €403.2 million in 2021 to €574.9 million in 2022,
while foreign sales increased by €258.7 million, or 32.2%, from €802.7 million in 2021 to €1,061.4 million in
2022, both primarily due to the significant increases in the average sales prices for our finished and semifinished products as described above. In addition, sales volumes of finished products in Germany increased
by 19,000 tons or 7.6%, from 251,000 tons in 2021 to 270,000 tons in 2022, while foreign sales volumes
increased by 7,000 tons or 1.6%, from 430,000 tons in 2021 to 437,000 tons in 2022. Sales volumes for finished
products in Germany in 2021, especially in the first quarter of 2021, were particularly negatively impacted by
policies implemented at some retailers to pursue high stock levels and fill up their warehouses with various
branded products from Eastern Europe and Russia in the fourth quarter of 2020 in order to be prepared for
further anticipated panic buying triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The following table sets forth the sales of our Consumer and Professional business units as well as our sales of

In 2022, sales of our Consumer and Professional business units as well as our sales of semi-finished products
accounted for 79.8%, 14.6% and 5.6%, respectively, of total sales, compared to 79.3%, 13.0% and 7.6%,
respectively, of total sales in 2021. Sales of our Consumer business unit increased by €349.5 million, or 36.5%,
from €956.5 million in 2021 to €1,306.0 million in 2022, while sales of our Professional business unit increased
by €80.9 million, or 51.5%, from €157.2 million in 2021 to €238.1 million in 2022, both as a result to the price
increases we managed to implement during the course of 2022 and the rebound in demand with the declining
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, which had negatively impacted sales volumes in our Professional
business unit particularly hard in 2021. Our sales of semi-finished products increased slightly by €0.1 million,
or 0.1%, from €92.1 million in 2021 to €92.2 million in 2022, as price increases more than offset the impact of
the strategic decision to reduce sales of semi-finished products to third parties described above.

Our inventory of finished and semi-finished products increased significantly by €63.5 million in 2022,
compared to an increase of €1.9 million in 2021. In 2022, we built our finished product stocks back up to their
target levels after a demand peak at the end of 2021, and we further made a strategic decisions to increase our
stocks of semi-finished products as a hedge against anticipated disruptions to production related to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, as described above. In addition, the significant increase in our finished and
semi-finished inventories during 2022 also reflected the significant increase in the relevant market prices over
the course of 2022. Generally, our inventory levels are influenced by both short term factors, such as special
promotion measures and inventory management measures taken by our key customers, and long term factors,
such as increases or decrease in sales as well as expansion projects and our investment program.

Other operating income increased by €3.6 million, or 13.4%, from €27.1 million in 2021 to €30.7 million in
2022, primarily due to (i) an increase in income from exchange rate differences of €7.6 million, or 120.8%,
from €6.3 million in 2021 to €13.9 million in 2022, mainly relating to currency gains from Polish Złoty and
British Pounds based business transactions, while (ii) income from other periods decreased by €2.0 million, or
17.5%, from €11.6 million in 2021 to €9.6 million in 2022, and (iii) income from value adjustment on
receivables decreased by €0.9 million, from a positive contribution of €0.8 million in 2021 to a negative
contribution of €0.1 million due to bad debt allowances in 2022. Income from release of difference from
capital consolidation of €2.1 million in 2021 and 2022 relate to the integration of the former Greenfield plant
of the French Arjowiggins Group in Château-Thierry, France (since renamed to WEPA Greenfield SAS) in
March 2019. Income from other periods in 2022 included reimbursements in relation to energy matters, mainly
electricity price compensation in Germany.

Cost of materials increased substantially by €376.7 million, or 52.7%, from €714.1 million in 2021 (59.2% of
sales, or 59.1% of total operating performance) to €1,090.8 million in 2022 (66.7% of sales, or 64.2% of total
operating performance). This cost increase was primarily related to market price inflation especially with
regard to our raw materials and energy. The increase in the cost of raw materials, supplies and purchased
goods by €225.9 million, or 40.9%, from €552.2 million in 2021 to €778.1 million in 2022, mainly resulted
from an increase in our pulp costs by 65.4% in 2022 compared to 2021, following (i) a significant increase in
the average price per ton for pulp in 2022 as well as (ii) additional pulp consumption due to the start-up of our
newest paper machine at our manufacturing site at Bridgend, United Kingdom, in May 2022. In addition,
costs for recovered paper increased by €11.1 million, or 12.1%, from €91.6 million in 2021 to €102.7 million in
2022, and packaging costs increased by €24.3 million, or 35.3%, from €68.8 million in 2021 to €93.1 million in
2022. The cost of raw materials, supplies and purchased goods increased substantially by 40.9% in 2022
compared to 2021, due to significant increases in the average price per ton for pulp and recovered paper. The
average pulp price per ton we paid in 2022 increased by 32.3%, from €487 in 2021 to €644 in 2022, mainly due
to inflated market prices for pulp, resulting in increasing pulp costs of €80.4 million, while the average price
for recovered paper increased by 26.6% from €205 per ton in 2021 to €260 per ton in 2022, leading to a


-----

recovered paper cost increase of €24.3 million. See also “Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—
_Exposure to Fluctuations in Pulp and Recovered Paper Prices” above._

In 2022, our consumption of pulp increased by 60,000 tons compared to 2021, primarily due to additional
pulp consumption as a result of the start-up of our newest paper machine at our manufacturing site at
Bridgend, United Kingdom, in May 2022, which resulted in increased pulp costs of €38.6 million in 2022. By
contrast, our consumption of recovered paper decreased by 51,000 tons in 2022 mainly due to reduced
production for external sale of our semi-finished product de-inked pulp. The lower consumption resulted in
reduced recovered paper costs of €13.3 million.

Third party service costs increased substantially by €150.8 million, or 93.1% in 2022, primarily due to an
increase of energy expenses by €147.5 million, or 126.7%, from €116.3 million in 2021 to €263.8 million in
2022 as a result of the significant market price increases for electricity and gas seen during 2022. Cost for
electricity increased by €59.8 million, or 105.7% from €56.5 million in 2021 to €116.3 million in 2022, cost for
gas by €70.1 million, or 152.7% from €45.9 million in 2021 to €116.0 million in 2022 and cost for steam by
€14.8 million, or 108.5% from €13.7 million in 2021 to €28.5 million in 2022. As a percentage of our total
operating performance, cost of purchased services increased by 5.0%, as increases in the sales prices for our
finished products largely compensated the significant increases in energy market price during the period.

Personnel expense in 2022 increased by €17.3 million, or 7.9%, from €217.4 million in 2021 to €234.6 million
in 2022, reflecting a €15.3 million, or 8.7% increase in salaries and wages from €175.2 million in 2021 to
€190.5 million on 2022 and a €2.0 million, or 4.7%, increase in social security contributions and retirement
and assistance costs from €42.2 million in 2021 to €44.2 million in 2022. The 8.7% increase in salaries and
wages in 2022 compares to an increase of only 1.1% in the average number of employees from 3,742 employees
in 2021 to 3,785 employees in 2022 and was primarily the result of annual salary and wage increases at elevated
levels as a result of high general inflation numbers.

site in Bridgend, United Kingdom in May 2022, whereas the growth in the number of our administrative
employees occurred across different locations and included the hiring of new employees in new business areas
such as e-commerce, communications and sustainability as well as new employees in areas such as IT, finance
and production.

Other operating expenses increased by €49.1 million, or 23.3%, from €210.8 million in 2021 to €259.9 million
in 2022. This increase was primarily due to an increase of freight costs by €15.5 million, or 13.9%, from
€111.5 million in 2021 to €127.0 million in 2022, mainly resulting from higher diesel prices, a higher market
demand for truck transportation and an increase in the sales of our finished products. Cost of third party
services increased by €1.8 million, or 12.0%, from €15.4 million in 2021 to €17.2 million in 2022, primarily
reflecting higher external personnel expenses in the areas of production, warehousing and internal logistics.
Expenses from exchange rate differences increased by €12.0 million, from €3.5 million in 2021 to €15.5 million
in 2022, primarily related to transactions in Polish Złoty and British Pounds, both including realized and
unrealized exchange rate losses, the latter in relation to the conversion of foreign currency balance sheet
liabilities into the relevant reporting currency. However, the increase in expenses from exchange rate differences
was largely offset by a corresponding income from exchange rate difference during the same period as
described under “other operating income” above. Expenses from other periods also increased by €2.4 million,
or 122.8%, from €2.0 million in 2021 to €4.4 million in 2022, mainly related to energy and valuation impacts
on spare part stocks related to other periods. Insurance expenses increased by €1.3 million, or 25.6%, from
€5.1 million in 2021 to €6.4 million in 2022 and intercompany other expenses increased by €2.2 million, or
23.0%, from €9.4 million in 2021 to €11.6 million in 2022, mainly as a result of higher management services
rendered by our parent WEPA SE. Other operating expenses in 2022 also include €3.8 million of extraordinary
expenses, mainly due to extraordinary expenses in relation to the 2022 Cyber Attack and expenses related to
a successful refinancing of our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and our ABS Program we completed in
2022. The increase in “others” of €10.5 million, from €34.1 million in 2021 to €44.6 million in 2022, among
other items, reflects (i) an increase in expenses for repair and spare parts of vehicles of €0.9 million, or 40.8%,
from €2.2 million in 2021 to €3.1 million in 2022, (ii) an increase in maintenance expenses on buildings of
€1.3 million, or 171.3%, from €0.8 million in 2021 to €2.1 million in 2022 and (iii) an increase in contract
penalties of €1.5 million, or 120.6%, from €1.3 million in 2021 to €2.8 million in 2022.

See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

Our EBITDA increased by €52.5 million, or 56.4%, from €93.1 million in 2021 to €145.6 million in 2022, as a
result of the factors described above. Our EBITDA margin (i.e. EBITDA as a percentage of our total
operating performance) in 2022 was 8.6% compared to an EBITDA margin of 7.7% in 2021.

Amortization and depreciation expenses increased by €3.4 million, or 5.9%, from €58.1 million in 2021 to
€61.5 million in 2022. This increase was mainly driven by a €1.9 million, or 3.6%, increase in depreciation on
tangible assets, primarily as a result of our recent strategic investments, such as our new paper machines at
our manufacturing sites in Piechowice, Poland and Bridgend, United Kingdom, as well as our investment into
several new converting lines. For more detail, see “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of
Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program; Sustainable Capacity Management” above. In
addition, amortization on intangible assets increased by €1.5 million, or 35.5%, from €4.2 million in 2021 to
€5.7 million in 2022, mainly related to the depreciation of goodwill in connection with our acquisition of the
former Victor Güthoff Group (now WEPA Category Solutions) in October 2020.

Our interest income/(expenses), net increased by €7.9 million, or 45.0%, from net expenses of €17.5 million in
2021 to net expenses of €25.3 million in 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher interest and similar
expenses of €6.5 million, or 33.7%, from €19.5 million in 2021 to €26.0 million in 2022, driven by a higher
utilization of our ABS Program and interest expenses related to a cross currency swap.

Trade taxes increased by €1.1 million, or 129.7%, from €0.9 million in 2021 to €2.0 million in 2022 and
corporate taxes increased by €7.4 million, from €1.3 million in 2021 to €8.7 million in 2022, both driven by our
improved operating result in 2022. Deferred taxes changed from a deferred tax expense of €7.0 million in 2021
to a deferred tax income of €1.9 million in 2022 primarily resulting from exchange rate effects on receivables /
liabilities in our subsidiaries in Poland and the UK, accruals for impending losses from hedging.

Other taxes increased by €1.1 million, or 10.6%, from €10.6 million in 2021 to €11.7 million in 2022, primarily
due to additional energy tax and non-income tax related to previous periods in 2022.

**_Sales_**

Total sales decreased by €48.4 million, or 3.9%, from €1,254.3 million in 2020 to €1,205.9 million in 2021.
During the same period, sales volumes of finished products decreased by 60,000 tons or 8.1%, from 741,000
tons in 2020 to 681,000 tons in 2021, mainly due to lower demand for finished products, especially in the first
quarter of 2021, as some retailers, in particular in Germany, had pursued a policy of high stock levels and
filled up their warehouses with various branded products from Eastern Europe and Russia in the fourth
quarter of 2020 in order to be prepared for further panic buying. See “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability
_of our Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic”above. In addition, due to steep decreases in raw material_
prices in 2020, we faced strong pressure from our customers to reduce the prices for our products in almost all
regions, which resulted in price reductions in the third quarter of 2020. As a result, the average sales prices of
our finished products was 0.7% lower in 2021, compared to 2020. Sales of semi-finished products, on the
other hand, increased by 35,000 tons or 44.5%, from 80,000 tons in 2020 to 115,000 tons in 2021. Non-tissue
sales also increased in 2021, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the former Victor Güthoff Group (now
WEPA Category Solutions) in October 2020. See “Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—
_Expansion Projects and Investment Program; Sustainable Capacity Management”._

In 2021, sales in Germany accounted for 33.4% of total sales compared to 40.2% of total sales in 2020. Sales
in Germany decreased by €100.5 million, or 20.0%, from €503.7 million in 2020 to €403.2 million in 2021,
whilst the foreign sales increased by €52.1 million, or 6.9%, from €750.6 million in 2020 to €802.7 million in
2021. The decrease in sales in Germany resulted primarily from decreases in volume of finished products as
described above, whereas the increase in foreign sales in 2021 was mainly driven by higher finished product
sales in France as well as increased sales of semi-finished products.

The following table sets forth the sales of our Consumer and Professional business units as well as our sales of
semi-finished products to third parties:

accounted for 79,3%, 13.0% and 7.6%, respectively, of total sales, compared to 80.1%, 14.9% and 4.9%,
respectively, of total sales in 2020. Sales of our Consumer business unit decreased by €48.3 million, or 4.8%,
from €1,004.8 million in 2020 to €956.5 million in 2021, for the reasons described above. Sales of our
Professional business unit decreased by €30.3 million, or 16.2%, from €187.5 million in 2020 to €157.2 million
in 2021, as our Professional business unit was especially hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the
closure of hotels, restaurants, schools and other public spaces. Our sales of our semi-finished products
increased by €30.2 million, or 48.7%, from €62.0 million in 2020 to €92.1 million in 2021.

Our inventory of finished and semi-finished products increased by €1.9 million in 2021, compared to a
decrease of €5.7 million in 2020, mainly driven by a higher stock level of semi-finished products. Our inventory
levels are generally influenced by both short term factors, such as special promotion measures and inventory
management measures taken by our key customers, and long term factors, such as increases or decreases in
sales as well as expansion projects and our investment program.

Other operating income decreased by €1.2 million, or 4.2%, from €28.3 million in 2020 to €27.1 million in
2021, primarily due to (i) a decrease of €6.7 million, or 51.3% in income from exchange rate differences, from
€13.0 million in 2020 to €6.3 million in 2021, with relate to currency gains from PLN and GBP based business
transactions, (ii) a decrease in income from release of provisions of €0.9 million, or 22.6%, from €4.1 million
in 2020 to €3.2 million in 2021 and (iii) a decrease in income from release of difference from capital
consolidation of €1.9 million, or 47.8%, from €4.1 million in 2020 to €2.1 million in 2021. Income from release
of difference from capital consolidation in 2020 and 2021 mainly related to the acquisition of WEPA
Greenfield SAS, covering expenses for initial underperformance of the newly acquired entity by an elevated
release of difference from capital consolidation in 2020. These decreases where only partially off-set by (i) a
significant increase in income from other periods of €5.9 million, or 103.4%, from €5.7 million in 2020 to
€11.6 million in 2021. Income from other periods in 2021, in particular, included reimbursements in relation
to energy matters as well as an appreciation in value of current assets related to our spare part inventories.
Other income also increased by €2.1 million from €0.8 million in 2020 to €2.9 million in 2021, including as a
result of income from insurance claims.

Cost of materials increased by €34.8 million, or 5.1%, from €679.3 million in 2020 (54.2% of sales, or 54.4% of
total operating performance) to €714.1 million in 2021 (59.2% of sales, or 59.1% of total operating
performance). This increase was primarily the result of a €34.2 million, or 26.7% increase in the costs of third
party services, from €127.8 million in 2020 to €161.9 million in 2021, mainly due to a 51.5% increase in energy
costs in 2021 compared to 2020. Hedging measures taken in 2021 as well as the consumption of low priced
raw material stocks purchased in 2020 largely offset the market-driven increases in energy costs. See also “Key
_Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Exposure to Fluctuations in Energy Prices”._

Costs of raw materials, supplies and purchased goods overall increased by €0.7 million, or 0.1%, in 2021 as
(i) the increase in recovered paper and pulp market prices was widely compensated by hedging measures as
well as the consumption of low priced raw material stocks purchased in 2020 and (ii) an increase in purchase
costs for trading goods, mainly driven by the acquisition of the Victor Güthoff Group (now: WEPA Category
Solutions), was more than offset by reduced external sourcing of jumbo reels. The average pulp price per ton
we paid in 2021 increased by 7.7%, from €452 in 2020 to €487 in 2021, mainly due to market price increases,
which was largely offset by our hedging in 2021, while the average price for recovered paper increased by
31.7% from €156 per ton in 2020 to €205 per ton in 2021, due to strong market price increases for all grades,
reinforced by lower availability of recovered paper. See also “Key Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—Exposure to Fluctuations in Pulp and Recovered Paper Prices” above. Despite the increase in the_
average pulp price per ton we paid in 2021 compared to 2020, our pulp costs decreased by €17.0 million in
2021 due to the release of accruals for impending losses from pulp hedging positions we established in prior
periods. Our consumption of pulp decreased slightly by 1,000 tons from 513,000 tons in 2020 to 512,000 tons
in 2021. In addition, our consumption of recovered paper decreased by 24,000 tons from 470,000 tons in 2020
to 446,000 tons in 2021, driven by lower paper making output in 2021.

Personnel expense in 2021 decreased slightly by €0.8 million, or 0.3%, from €218.1 million in 2020 to
€217.4 million in 2021, reflecting a €1.9 million, or 1.1% decrease in salaries and wages, from €177.1 million in
2020 to €175.2 million in 2021, and a €1.2 million, or 2.8% increase in social security contributions and
retirement and assistance costs from €41.2 million in 2020 to €42.3 million in 2021. The decrease in salaries
and wages was primarily driven by shift reductions in the production of finished products and the release of
bonus provisions due to the non-payment of performance bonuses, which was partly offset by the 2.8%
increase in social security contributions and retirement and assistance costs due to additional personnel costs
as a result of the acquisition of WEPA Category Solutions and higher expenses for social contribution and
pension funds. The average number of employees increased slightly, with 3,741 employees in 2020 and 3,742
employees in 2021.

The number of factory workers decreased by 48 or 1.7%, from 2,794 in 2020 to 2,746 in 2021, mainly due to
fewer temporary factory workers as a result of shift reductions in the production of finished products. The
average number of administrative employees, on the other hand, increased by 49 or 5.2%, from 947 in 2020 to
996 in 2021, mainly due to the acquisition WEPA Category Solutions in October 2020.

Other operating expenses increased slightly by €0.8 million, or 0.4%, from €209.9 million in 2020 to
€210.8 million in 2021, primarily due to a €9.2 million, or 9.0%, increase in the cost of freight from
€102.3 million in 2020 to €111.5 million in 2021 as a result of (i) increased transportation of semi-finished
products to customers, as well as (ii) internal transportation between our manufacturing sites, (iii) higher
costs for external warehouses, and (iv) additional transportation costs following the acquisition of the Victor


-----

Güthoff Group (now: Wepa Category Solutions). In addition, intercompany other expenses increased by
€1.6 million, or 20.0%, from €7.9 million in 2020 to €9.4 million in 2021, mainly as a result of higher
management expenses for WEPA SE. IT costs increased by €1.3 million, or 17.8%, from €7.1 million in 2020
to €8.4 million in 2021, mainly as a result of our continuing focus on digitalization and automatization of
operating processes, and insurance expenses increased by €0.8 million, or 19.8%, from €4.3 million in 2020 to
€5.1 million in 2021. In addition, “others” also increased by €4.1 million, or 13.5% from €30.0 million in 2020
to €34.1 million in 2021, partly due to (i) higher expenses for IT licenses, (ii) higher expenses for print
preparation and marketing as well as (iii) additional other operating expenses related to the Victor Güthoff
Group (now: Wepa Category Solutions) we acquired in October 2020.

These increases were largely offset by significant decreases in expenses from exchange rate differences, expenses
from other periods, other distribution related costs and extraordinary expenses. Expenses from exchange rate
differences decreased by €11.1 million, or 76.1%, from €14.6 million in 2020 to €3.5 million in 2021. These
expenses primarily relate to business transactions in Polish Złoty and British Pounds and include both realized
and unrealized exchange rate losses, the latter in relation to the conversion of foreign currency balance sheet
liabilities into the relevant reporting currency. Expenses from other periods also decreased by €0.8 million, or
30.0%, from €2.8 million in 2020 to €2.0 million in 2021. These expenses include several smaller expense items,
such as mandatory contributions related to the German national packaging recycling scheme “Grüner Punkt”
as well as consultancy and maintenance expenses attributable to the period of 2020. In addition, we recorded
significant extraordinary expenses of €4.3 million in 2020 in connection with portfolio and cost optimization
measures we implemented in Italy as well as refinancing expenses related to the tap offering of €50 million of
our Existing Fixed Rate Notes in the first quarter of 2020.

(1) EBITDA means the total operating performance, plus other internally produced and capitalized assets, plus other operating income,
minus the cost of materials, minus personnel expense, minus other operating expenses. EBITDA is not a German GAAP measure.
See “Presentation of Financial Information”.

Our EBITDA decreased by €77.1 million, or 45.3%, from €170.1 million in 2020 to €93.1 million in 2021.
Based on low raw material price levels in 2020, our sales prices under tenders that matured in the first half
2021 decreased substantially, while market prices, in particular for raw materials and energy as well as costs
for transportation increased significantly, leading to a significant reduction of our EBITDA margin. Our
EBITDA margin (i.e. EBITDA as a percentage of our total operating performance) in 2021 was 7.7%

Amortization and depreciation expenses decreased by €5.0 million, or 7.9%, from €63.0 million in 2020 to
€58.1 million in 2021, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation on tangible assets by €4.6 million, or 7.8%,
from €58.5 million in 2020 to €53.9 million in 2021, mainly driven by extraordinary depreciation expenses in
2020 of our former crepe-producing paper machine and converting lines located at our site in Piechowice,
Poland, which we disassembled following a decision to exit the crepe business in 2020. Amortization on
intangible assets also decreased by €0.4 million, or 8.2%, from €4.6 million in 2020 to €4.2 million in 2021. The
position also comprises additional amortization and depreciation expenses related to the former Victor
Güthoff Group (since renamed Wepa Category Solutions), which we acquired in October 2020.

Our interest income/(expenses), net decreased by €3.1 million, or 15.2%, from net expenses of €20.6 million in
2020 to net expenses of €17.5 million in 2021. The decrease was mainly driven by (i) an increase in interest and
similar income of €1.8 million, from €0.1 million in 2020 to €2.0 million in 2021 and (ii) a decrease in interest
and similar expenses of €1.2 million, from €20.6 million in 2020 to €19.5 million in 2021. The increase in
interest and similar income was due to interest income from a cross currency swap, while the decrease in
interest and similar expenses resulted from the valuation impact from provisions for anticipated losses related
to interest rate swaps.

Total taxes decreased by €12.2 million, or 38.1%, from €32.1 million in 2020 to €19.9 million in 2021, primarily
due to lower income taxes mainly related to the result development as well as reduced other taxes, mainly real
estate taxes. Trade taxes decreased by €7.1 million, or 88.9%, from €8.0 million in 2020 to €0.9 million in 2021
and corporate taxes decreased by €12.0 million, or 90.2%, from €13.2 million in 2020 to €1.3 million in 2021,
primarily due to reduced earnings. This was partly offset by higher deferred taxes of €10.1 million, from
deferred tax income of €3.1 million in 2020 to deferred tax expenses of €7.0 million in 2021, primarily relating
to lower deferred tax assets on other provisions and increased deferred tax liabilities on tangible fixed assets
as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, partly compensated by (i) the foreign currency
effects from changes in the exchange rate of Polish Złoty and British Pounds to euro, (ii) a change in tax rates
applied in the United Kingdom, (iii) higher release of accruals for impending losses and tax credits as well as
(iv) several balance sheet items as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.

Other taxes decreased by €2.7 million, or 20.1%, from €13.3 million in 2020 to €10.6 million in 2021, mainly
due to lower real estate and energy related tax expenses.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITALIZATION**

**Overview**

Our primary sources of financing are cash generated from our operating activities, the Existing Notes,
borrowings under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, our ABS Program and bank loans of individual


-----

subsidiaries. We utilize cash primarily for debt and tax servicing requirements, the purchase of raw materials,
freight and energy, working capital, personnel expenses and capital expenditures.

Our ability to generate cash from our operating activities depends on our operating performance, which is in
turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed under “Risk Factors”. In
addition, we will only be able to draw the full commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
if, among other things, we meet the financial covenants set out in the facility agreement relating thereto. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility”.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, together with the proceeds from
the Offering, capacity under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, our ABS Program, bank loans of
individual subsidiaries and cash and cash equivalents, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and
debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating
activities or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to
pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. Our ability to generate cash
from operating activities depends on our future operating performance, which, in turn, depends to some
extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See
“Risk Factors”.

If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources (including borrowings under our
current or any future credit facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our
liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell certain of our assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the Notes and any future debt may limit our ability to
pursue any of these alternatives.

However, we believe that our short- to medium-term hedging measures, our ability to preserve cash in the
mid-term through the adaptation of the amount of our controlled capital expenditures, a stable financing
structure and long term improvements to our profitability and cash generation put us in a strong financial
position and give us significant flexibility to weather and/or adapt to challenges that may face us or our
industry as a whole (e.g. rapid increases in energy costs or raw material prices or increased competition).

The following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and for

_Cash flow from operating activities_

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, cash flow from operating activities increased by
€123.3 million, or 512.9%, from €24.0 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2022 to
€147.4 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the
€172.7 million, or 272.6%, EBITDA increase, from €63.4 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 to €236.0 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, mainly driven by
our ability to maintain higher sales pricing for our finished products at prices negotiated toward the end of
2022, based on the then-peak market prices for our input factors, while the market prices for our input factors
decreased significantly in 2023. However, the change in inventories, trade receivables and other assets of
€64.6 million, from an increase of €111.6 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2022 to a
further increase €46.9 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 created a negative impact
on the cash flow from operating activities, mainly driven by an increase in on-balance trade receivables due to
a reduced utilization of our ABS Program, partly offset by a reduction in gross trade receivables. In addition,
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our inventory levels of raw and auxiliary materials
increased due to pulp volumes purchased at low-priced spot market for consumption in the following period,
partly offset by reduced stocks of semi-finished products. Furthermore, the change in trade payables and
other liabilities of €(68.8) million, from an increase of €34.5 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 to a decrease of €34.3 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 had a
negative impact on our cash flow from operating activities driven by lower trade payables, mainly due to
deflation effects and lower liabilities to shareholders. This was partly compensated by the increase in provisions
of €12.0 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, mainly related to tax, anticipated losses,
personnel and energy. Our cash flow from operating activities in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023 included income tax payments of €9.6 million compared to income tax payments of €5.1 million in the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2022.

In 2022, cash flow from operating activities decreased significantly by €80.4 million, or 51.4%, from
€156.3 million in 2021 to €75.9 million in 2022. The EBITDA contribution increased by €52.5 million, or
56.4% from €93.1 million in 2021 to €145.6 million in 2022, as we managed to successfully negotiate significant
consecutive increases for our finished and semi-finished products with our customers in response to increasing
market cost levels for our raw materials, packaging material, transportation as well as the tremendous price
hike in energy. We further succeeded in shortening contract cycles with our customers and took various
measures to enhance the energy efficiency of our production to allow us to respond more quickly to the
ongoing volatility of our input costs. However, the increase in inventories, trade receivables and other assets
of €196.7 million, from a decrease of €64.5 million in 2021 to an increase of €132.2 million in 2022 created a
negative impact on the cash flow from operating activities, mainly driven by the build-up of finished product
stocks to return to target levels after a demand peak end of 2021, as described above. In addition, trade
receivables were on a significantly elevated level due to a stronger demand and materialization of sales price
increases, though partly compensated by a higher utilization of our ABS Program. This was partly
compensated by the change in provisions of €61.5 million from a decrease of €22.8 million in 2021 to an
increase of €38.7 million in 2022 mainly due to increased provisions for energy, personnel and anticipated
losses. Furthermore the change in increase in trade payables and other liabilities of €3.3 million, from
€36.9 million in 2021 to €40.1 million in 2022 had a positive impact on the cash flow from operating activities,
driven by higher trade payables, mainly due to inflation effects, and higher other liabilities, related to our ABS
Program and higher liabilities to shareholders.

In 2021, our cash flow from operating activities increased by €84.4 million, or 117.3%, from €71.9 million in
2020 to €156.3 million in 2021. This increase was primarily driven by a change of €116.4 million in inventories,
trade receivables and other assets from decrease of €51.9 million in 2020 to an increase of €64.5 million in
2021 primarily due to lower receivables mainly caused by a higher utilization of the ABS Program to interim
finance capital expenditures projects which were part of our strategic investment program approved in 2020,
such as two new paper machines located at our manufacturing sites in Piechowice and Bridgend as well as the
investment in new converting lines at sites in Bridgend, Troyes, Lille, Giershagen, Leuna, Kriebstein,
Piechowice and Swalmen. Furthermore, cash flow from operating activities benefited from a change in trade
payables and other liabilities of €66.3 million, from a decrease of €29.4 million in 2020 to an increase of
€36.9 million in 2021. These increases were partly offset by a €77.1 million, or 45.3% decrease in EBITDA,
from €170.1 million in 2020 to €93.1 million in 2021, mainly driven by a decrease in net sales of €48.4 million,
or 3.9%, from €1,254.3 million in 2020 to €1,205.9 million in 2021 mainly due to lower demand for finished
products especially in the first quarter of 2021 as consequence of high stocks at our customers resulting from
stronger purchase in the fourth quarter of 2020 and ongoing regulations in the public sector due to the
COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher material costs which increased from 54.2% of sales in 2020 to 59.2% of


-----

sales in 2021. The increase in percentage cost of material in relation of sales revenue resulted from strong and
sudden market price increases especially for our raw materials, energy and transportation costs while, based
on tender maturities applied in 2020 and early 2021, our selling prices adapted to the higher input costs with
delay. In addition, a €30.2 million change in provisions from an increase of €7.4 million in 2020 to a decrease
of €22.8 million in 2021 as well as a €4.3 million decrease in expenses for extraordinary items, from €4.3 million
in 2020 to nil in 2021, which related to our exit from crepe paper production in 2020, had a negative impact on
cash flow from operating activities.

As highlighted in the preceding paragraphs, cash flow from operating activities is significantly affected by
changes in trade working capital. As a result, our cash flow from operating activities can be significantly
affected by changes in raw material prices or an increase or decrease of sales volumes as those factors affect
the amount of inventories, trade receivables and trade payables. The following table sets forth our trade
working capital as of the dates indicated:

(1) Trade Working Capital (unaudited; not a German GAAP measure) we define as trade receivables plus inventories, minus trade
payables.

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our Trade Working Capital increased by €89.9 million,
or 31.3%, from €287.5 million as of September 30, 2022 to €377.4 million as of September 30, 2023, primarily
due to an increase in our inventory of raw materials, from €159.8 million as of September 30, 2022 to
€193.5 million as of September 30, 2023, which was driven by high-volume purchases of raw materials from
the spot market in the third quarter of 2023, mainly to take advantage of lower market prices as well as to
procure additional raw materials required for our newly acquired stock preparation unit in Kriebstein. In
addition, inventories of finished products slightly increased related to higher customer demand levels. Overall,
our inventories in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 comprise significant effects from deflation
on input materials. Our inventory levels are generally influenced by both short term factors, such as special
promotion measures and inventory management measures taken by our key customers, and long term factors,
such as increases or decreases in sales volumes as well as expansion projects. The significant increase of our
trade receivables by €25.1 million to €144.2 million as of September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from a lower
utilization of our ABS Program, partly compensated by a reduction in gross trade receivables due to the,
though delayed, adaptations of our sales prices to the lower market price levels for our input factors. The
€27.5 million decrease in trade payables, partly related to lower raw material and energy prices, from
€143.7 million as of September 30, 2022 to €116.2 million as of September 30, 2023, also increased our Trade
Working Capital.

In 2022, our Trade Working Capital increased by €112.9 million, or 55.7%, from €202.7 million as of
December 31, 2021 to €315.6 million as of December 31, 2022. This increase is primarily attributable to an
increase in inventories by €87.6 million, or 35.6%, from €246.1 million as of December 31, 2021 to
€333.6 million as of December 31, 2022, as a result of a build-up of finished product stocks to return to target
levels after a demand peak end of 2021 and a strategic decision to reduce sales of semi-finished products to
third parties to enable us to increase our inventory of jumbo reels as a hedge against anticipated disruptions
to production related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as described above. In addition, our finished and
semi-finished inventories comprised positive valuation effects resulting from inflated market prices. The
increase in inventories of raw and other materials as at December 31, 2022 was also mainly driven by inflation.
Further, trade receivables increased by €41.2 million, or 50.8%, from €81.1 million as of December 31, 2021 to
€122.3 million as of December 31, 2022, mainly as a result of the significant sales price increases we achieved
for our products in 2022, which was partly compensated by a higher utilization of our ABS Program. The
increase in trade receivables and inventories was only partially offset by an increase of our trade payables by


-----

€15.9 million, from €124.4 million as of December 31, 2021 to €140.3 million as of December 31, 2022,
primarily as a result of higher purchase costs for our input factors.

In 2021, our Trade Working Capital decreased by €109.3 million, or 35.0%, from €312.0 million as of
December 31, 2020 to €202.7 million as of December 31, 2021. Trade receivables decreased by €61.9 million,
from €143.0 million as of December 31, 2020 to €81.1 million as of December 31, 2021, driven by a higher
drawdown under our ABS facility in order to interim finance capital expenditure projects which were part of
our strategic investment program approved in 2020. The decrease of inventories by €13.2 million, from
€259.3 million as of December 31, 2020 to €246.1 million as of December 31, 2021, was mainly driven by the
consumption of raw material stocks purchased at high volume from spot market in 2020. Trade payables
increased by €34.2 million, or 37.9%, from €90.2 million as of December 31, 2020 to €124.4 million as of
December 31, 2021 in the normal course of business, thus following the price development on our main input
factors.

_Cash flow from investing activities_

Cash flow from investing activities generally consists of cash outflows for investments in tangible and
intangible assets, payments to acquire entities included in the basis of consolidation, payments to acquire
long term financial assets as well as cash inflows from the disposal of fixed assets and financial assets, interest
and dividends received.

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our cash outflow from investing activities decreased by
€22.8 million, or 41.0%, from €55.7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 to
€32.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The significantly higher cash outflows
from investment activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to capital
expenditures related to our strategic investment activities under our sustainable capacity management program
as described in more detail under “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations—
_Expansion Projects and Investment Program; Sustainable Capacity Management” above. In addition, low_
project investment activities especially during the first half-year 2023 were due to cautious investment
approvals in the prior year to preserve liquidity in response to the difficult operating environment and
performance.

In 2022, our cash outflow from investing activities decreased by €61.8 million, or 50.4%, from €122.6 million
in 2021 to €60.8 million in 2022. Cash outflows from investing activities in 2022 related primarily to our
standard maintenance investments, investments in energy efficiency (“Bluetec”) and the completion of our
strategic investment program initiated in 2020. In 2021, our cash outflow from investing activities increased
by €28.5 million, or 30.2%, from €94.1 million in 2020 to €122.6 million in 2021. This increase was primarily
due to higher strategic investment activities. While we reduced non-critical maintenance expenditure to
preserve liquidity in response to the difficult operating environment and performance, we resumed certain
strategic investment projects which included two new paper machines located at our manufacturing sites in
Piechowice and Bridgend as well as the investment in new converting lines at sites in Bridgend, Troyes, Lille,
Giershagen, Leuna, Kriebstein, Piechowice and Swalmen.

For more information about our capital expenditures, see also “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of our
_Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program; Sustainable Capacity Management”_
above “ and “—Capital Expenditures” below.

_Free cash flow_

We define “free cash flow” as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing
activities. Free cash flow comprises the cash surplus or deficit after expenditure on investments and taxes but
before net cash used in/provided by financing activities and before taking into account cash proceeds and
payments relating to shareholders’ equity and financial liabilities. The reasons for changes in the free cash
flow are therefore the same as explained above. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, our free
cash flow increased significantly by €146.1 million from a cash outflow of €31.6 million in the nine month
period ended September 30, 2022, to a cash inflow of €114.5 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023. In 2022, our free cash flow decreased by €18.6 million from a cash inflow of €33.7 million
in 2021 to a cash inflow of €15.2 million for 2022. In 2021, our free cash flow increased by €55.9 million or
from a cash outflow of €22.2 million in 2020 to a cash inflow of €33.7 million in 2021.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, cash outflows from financing activities increased by
€17.8 million, or 113.4%, from a cash outflow of €15.7 million in the nine month period ended 2022 to a cash


-----

outflow of €33.5 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher
interests paid and the regular dividend payment to the Parent.

In 2022, cash outflows for financing activities decreased by €12.9 million, or 33.3%, from a cash outflow of
€38.8 million in 2021 to a cash outflow of €25.9 million in 2022. The cash outflow from financing activities in
2022 was primarily driven by interest paid as well as repayments of loans and the repayment of a long-term
bank loan related to the original financing of a gas turbine by Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH, extraordinary
payments related to the 2022 Cyber Attack and the refinancing of our revolving credit facility as well as our
ABS Program.

In 2021, cash flow from financing activities decreased by €54.3 million, from net cash inflows of €15.5 million
in 2020 to net cash outflows of €38.8 million in 2021. The net cash inflows in 2020 primarily related to the
proceeds from a €50 million tap offering of our Existing Notes in January 2020, which were only partly offset
by dividends paid to the Parent as well as repayments of loans and the repayment of a long-term bank loan
related to the original financing of a gas turbine by Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH.

_Capital Expenditures_

We primarily finance our maintenance capital expenditures with cash flow from operations. From time to
time, we also finance our expansion capital expenditures through borrowings. The following table sets forth
our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as well as the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2023:

(1) Includes only payments to acquire intangible and tangible fixed assets, such as the acquisition of the stock preparation unit of
Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH in June 2023.

In response to industry-wide challenges such as sharply rising raw material and freight costs and high energy
prices, we continued to implement our original “Perform & Transform Strategy” adopted in 2019,
notwithstanding the special challenges imposed on us by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
We believe that the continuous, step-by-step strategic development of our asset base remains key to our
continued success as a leading, cost efficient tissue producer in Europe. This involves investments in sustainable
capacity management measures intended to drive further cost reductions, portfolio optimization, efficiency
improvements and working capital reductions.

As part of this sustainable capacity management and to further strengthen our market position and
competitiveness as the third largest producer in the European tissue paper market, we initiated a number of
strategic investment projects in 2020. These included the decision to invest in two new paper machines at our
sites in Piechowice and Bridgend as well as in new converting lines at our manufacturing sites in Piechowice,
Swalmen, Bridgend, Giershagen, Lille, Troyes, Leuna and Kriebstein. On June 1, 2023, we completed the
integration of the stock preparation unit (for the preparation of de-ink pulp from recovered paper) that we
had acquired by way of an asset purchase from the neighboring and insolvent Kübler & Niethammer
Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH into our tissue paper manufacturing site in Kriebstein, Germany.

In total, our capital expenditures amounted to €95.5 million in 2020, €123.8 million in 2021, €61.6 million in
2022 and €35.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. These amounts included (i) investments in our two
newest paper machines in Piechowice, Poland and Bridgend, United Kingdom of €41.5 million in 2020,
€57.8 million in 2021, €20.8 million in 2022 and €1.7 million in the first nine months of 2023, (ii) investments
in new converting capacities and stock preparation projects of €19.4 million in 2020, €49.7 million in 2021,
€25.0 million in 2022 and €8.4 million in the first nine months of 2023, as well as (iii) maintenance capital
expenditures of €34.7 million in 2020, €16.3 million in 2021, €15.7 million in 2022 and €25.0 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, our capital
expenditures amounted to €40.9 million and our maintenance capital expenditures to €29.0 million.

For more detail about our sustainable capacity management program and our main investment projects
between 2020 and September 30, 2023, see “Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of
_Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program; Sustainable Capacity Management” above._

**_Liquidity management and cash pooling_**

While we intend to primarily meet our liquidity requirements with cash generated from our operating
activities, we expect to have sufficient capacity available under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and
under our ABS Program to be able to meet any additional operating requirements. Upon completion of the
Offering and after giving effect to the transactions described under “Use of Proceeds”, we expect to have
undrawn capacity of €146.4 million under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. While we do not expect
there to be any outstanding drawings under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date,
we expect to have used an amount of €3.6 million under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility in the
form of payment guarantees provided pursuant to an ancillary facility. In addition, we expect to have the
ability to sell certain additional receivables under the ABS Program.

To manage our liquidity, we maintain a largely centralized cash management system, which includes all our
subsidiaries. In particular, liquidity plans are prepared with the group budget on a monthly rolling period for
a current fiscal year in which the expected cash receipts and payments for the specified time period are set off
against each other. We prepare 12-week liquidity plans on a weekly rolling basis and include a deviation
analysis. For the purposes of improved cash management, we have implemented a group-wide, central cash
pooling system. This system comprises several cash pooling agreements with different banks. The balances
resulting from the daily settlement of accounts are subject to interest at the margin applicable under our
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility from time to time. The general policy on subsidiary cash balances is to
transfer these to the accounts of the Issuer. This takes place daily for all participating entities.

**OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS**

The following discussion describes our material off-balance sheet arrangements, which consist of our ABS
Program, as well as operating leases and guarantee lines.

**ABS Program**

We optimize our liquidity by selling a portion of our trade receivables as part of an off balance asset backed
securities (ABS) program. Based on an agreement we originally entered into with Commerzbank AG, LBBW
and Raiffeisenbank International AG in 2018, and which we amended and extended in 2022 with
Commerzbank AG, DZ Bank and Raiffeisenbank International AG, for a 5 year term, we sell our trade
receivables to a special purpose vehicle (named Belvedere Financing) on a non-recourse basis in return for an
immediate cash payment. In order to cover the credit risk, we are paid the nominal amount of the sold
receivables minus pre agreed reserve amounts, a purchase price discount and transaction costs, which are
booked to the income statement. Trade receivables are sold on a revolving basis with a maximum aggregate
transaction volume of up to €220 million, currently committed with €184 million. The reduction down to a
level of €184 million was undertaken for cost control reasons. Within a time horizon of 120 days, the volume
can be increased again to € 220 million. As of September 30, 2023, we had €145.0 million of receivables
financed under our ABS Program.

**Operating leases**

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had operating leases in an aggregate amount of €13.1 million. As
of December 31, 2022, the future minimum lease payments under our existing operating leases were as follows:

**As of December 31, 2022**

**(€ in thousands)**
Minimum lease payments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6,236 6,416 446

**Guarantee lines**

As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have underwritten guarantees in the amount of €4.3 million
outstanding as ancillary utilizations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, we have
bilateral guarantee lines with (i) DZ Bank in the amount of €10.0 million, currently only partially utilized in
the form of a guarantee of €6.6 million and (ii) Euler Hermes AG in the amount of €5.0 million, also only
partially utilized in the form of a guarantee of PLN 148,560.00. As of the date of this offering memorandum,
no payments have been made pursuant to such guarantees.

provides for up to €150.0 million of committed credit and €20.0 million of unsecured money market instruments
(Geldmarktinstrumente). See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility”and “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Bilateral Loans”. We do not intend to have any outstanding cash amounts under the Super Senior Revolving Credit_
Facility and/or the unsecured money market instrument on the Issue Date.
(4) Bilateral loans and other bank liabilities represent repayment and payment obligations under a loan of Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH, as
borrower, from Volksbank Sauerland in the amount of €61,875.00. For more detail about the bilateral loan, see “Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Bilateral Loans”._
(5) Total Debt excludes off balance ABS liabilities. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”.

**QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**

We are exposed to a number of different market risks arising from our normal business activities.

Based on our assets, liabilities and pending and planned transactions, we are particularly exposed to risks
arising from changes in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as credit risks, such as the
risk of default by counterparties. Furthermore, solvency must be assured at all times (liquidity risk). The
objective of risk management is to use appropriate measures to control these risks where they affect our cash
flows. Derivative financial instruments are used only for hedging purposes. They are not used for trading or
speculative purposes. Exchange effects resulting from the translation of financial statements in foreign
currencies into our reporting currency are not hedged. The guidelines for risk hedging and their
implementation are defined and continuously monitored by our Group Risk Management.

**Raw material price risks**

Raw material price risks result primarily from fluctuations in the prices of pulp and recovered paper. Due to
the fact that fluctuations in the prices of raw materials often cannot be passed on to customers fully and/or in
a timely manner, partial hedging is undertaken with commodity derivative instruments. Currently, these consist
mainly of pulp forward exchange contracts, from which we receive payments or we transfer payments to that
depend on the development of the pulp stock price, and are therefore protected against price increases with
respect to the hedged raw material.

**Energy price risks**

Energy price risks result primarily from fluctuations in global energy prices and regulatory risks in Germany
and other markets in which we operate.

**Currency risk**

We primarily generate our sales in euro. Currency risk arises mainly on trade receivables and payable in foreign
currencies, on planned future sales revenue in foreign currency, and on existing and planned future contracts
for the supply of raw material where the purchase price is in a foreign currency. In addition, we currently
finance several of our foreign subsidiaries, including our Polish subsidiary Wepa Piechowice Sp. z o.o. and our


-----

English subsidiary Wepa UK Ltd. Throughout the years 2020, 2021 and 2022, there were currency risks
mainly in the exchange rates of the U.S. dollar, British pound and Polish zloty relative to the euro.

**Interest rate risk**

Currently, interest rate risks arise mainly on interest bearing liabilities that are denominated in euro. The ratio
of fixed interest and variable interest liabilities is constantly monitored by Group Risk Management. We
primarily manage interest rate risk through interest rate swaps or interest rate options.

Following completion of the Offering and the Transactions, we expect that our exposure to interest rate
fluctuations will relate primarily to drawings under our €150 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
and to receivables financing under our ABS Program.

**Credit risks**

Credit risks arise mainly on trade receivables, bank balances and derivative financial instruments. In view of
our broadly diversified customer list, which extends over various regions, the impact of credit risk on trade
accounts receivable is limited. Further, almost all of our trade accounts receivable are credit insured for nearly
their full face value under credit insurance we purchase in connection with our ABS Program.

To minimize the credit risks from the operational business activity, transactions with external customers are
only entered into after an internal credit check and a credit approval process. Based on the internal credit
check, a limit for a maximum credit risk per customer is set.

**SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, assumptions and estimates have been made which affect
the amounts and presentation of the assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position,
income and expenses, and contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could
result in outcomes that may require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of our assets and liabilities
in future periods.

By “significant”, we mean that the following accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results and require management’s subjective judgments, often as a result of the need
to estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We discuss the impact and risks associated
with these significant accounting policies on our business operations throughout this discussion and analysis
where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. You should note that the preparation of
our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period.

All assumptions and estimates are made according to the best of management’s knowledge and belief in order
to present a true and fair view of our net assets, financial position and results of operations. Since the actual
values may, in individual cases, differ from the assumptions and estimates that were made, these are
continuously reviewed. Adjustments to the estimates that are relevant for the financial statements are made in
the period in which the change occurs, provided that the change relates only to this period. If the change
relates not only to the reporting period but also to subsequent periods, the change is taken into account both
in the period of the change and in the subsequent periods.

**Capital Consolidation**

Capital consolidation is undertaken by offsetting the acquisition costs of the investment against the group’s
share of newly measured equity in the consolidated subsidiaries at the time of the first consolidation and in
accordance with section 301, paragraph 1 of the German Commercial Code. Reportable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries are reflected at their fair value regardless of the level of the minority
share. Hidden reserves and charges in existence at the time of the initial consolidation were disclosed and
accounted for in accordance with the underlying Assets and Liabilities.

Remaining asset differences (goodwill) are capitalized and amortized or, if necessary, written off. Remaining
differences on the Liabilities side (negative goodwill) are treated in accordance with section 309, paragraph 2
of the German Commercial Code respectively German Accounting Standard GAS 23.

Goodwill amounted to €14.4 million and negative goodwill amounted to €18.3 million as of December 31,
2022.


-----

**Currency Translation**

The assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements are converted at the prevailing exchange
rates on the relevant reporting date, equity items at historic exchange rates and expenses and income at the
average annual exchange rate during the relevant period. Resulting conversion differences are stated without
affecting our operating result under the item “Difference in equity from currency translation” in equity. As a
matter of principle, exchange rate changes in the case of intra Group receivables and liabilities are recorded
without an effect on our operating result.

**Fixed Assets**

Intangible Fixed Assets acquired against payment are capitalized at acquisition cost and, if subject to wear
and tear, amortized over their estimated useful life using the straight line method.

Goodwill from capital consolidation is amortized using the straight line method over a period of 10 years
according to section 309 (1) in conjunction with section 253 (3) of the German Commercial Code. Current
developments are reflected by extraordinary depreciation, if necessary.

Tangible Fixed Assets are valued at acquisition cost, taking into account ordinary straight-line depreciation.
Extraordinary depreciation is taken into consideration in the case of a permanent impairment. Additions
during the Fiscal year are depreciated pro rata temporis applying the straight line method.

**Valuation of Inventories**

Raw materials, supplies and merchandise as well as spare parts are valued at the lower of acquisition cost or
market price. Semi-finished and predominantly finished products are measured at production cost, these
include in addition to direct manufacturing and material costs also appropriate portions of production,
material and administration overhead costs. Interest on debt is not included in production costs. Some
companies within the Group currently value the production cost using the reverse costing method by
deducting any upcoming direct selling costs and distribution overhead costs as well as the profit margin from
the net sales price. Inventory risks are taken into account by considering appropriate valuation allowances.

**Receivables and other assets**

Receivables and other assets are valued at the lower of the nominal value or the fair value as at the balance
sheet date. Appropriate bad debt allowances are provided for receivables that are jeopardized by specific risks,
the general credit risk is covered by a general allowance.

Several companies of the Wepa group sell a portion of their trade receivables as part of an off balance asset
backed securities (ABS) program to a special purpose vehicle (named Belvedere Financing S.A.) on a nonrecourse basis in return for an immediate cash payment. In order to cover the credit risk, we are paid the
nominal amount of the sold receivables minus pre agreed reserve amounts. A portion of the pre agreed reserve
amounts (so called “default reserve”), the purchase price discount and transaction costs are recorded as
expenses in our income statement. For a detailed description of our ABS Program, see “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—ABS Program”._

**Pension provisions**

Pension provisions for vested and current pension obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit
method based on the “Richttafeln 2018 G” (Generation Mortality Tables) of Professor Dr. Klaus Heubeck.
They are calculated in accordance with Section 253(1) sentence 2 and Section 253(2) of the German
Commercial Code (in similar application of IAS 19). Calculations are based on an Interest Rate of 1.78% as
of December 31, 2022 (prior year: 1.89%).

Anticipated salary and pension increases are reflected at a rate of 2.0% (prior year: 2.0%) and 2.0% (prior
year: 2.0%), respectively. A fluctuation rate of 0.0% (prior year: 0.0%) was used.

**Tax and Other Provisions**

Tax and other provisions are considered for all identifiable risks and uncertain liabilities. They have to be
assessed at the amount which is required to be paid according to a reasonable commercial assessment, taking
into account price and cost increases. Provisions with a remaining maturity of more than one year are
discounted with the average market interest rate for the past seven years corresponding to their residual
maturity.


-----

For the determination of deferred taxes caused by temporary or quasi permanent differences between the
commercial and the tax based valuation of assets and liabilities or caused by tax loss carryforwards and tax
credits, the amounts of the highly probable future tax charges or tax reductions are calculated using the
company individual tax rates at the time the differences will be effective, these amounts are not discounted.
The capitalization of deferred taxes in the Financial Statements of the consolidated companies was applied in
accordance with the existing disclosure option under Section 274(1) of the German Commercial Code. On
differences resulting from consolidation measures deferred taxes are accounted for in application of
section 306 paragraph 1 of the German commercial Code. As at December 31, 2022 the deferred tax assets
and tax liabilities are offset against each other and the surplus is disclosed as deferred tax liabilities.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate, currency and commodity risks associated
with realized, pending and planned underlying transactions.

Under German GAAP, the realized and pending underlying transactions can be recorded as valuation units
with the related hedging transactions, either as a micro hedge or as a portfolio hedge. The same applies to
planned transactions underlying a macro or portfolio hedge. Under German GAAP, valuation units are valued
individually as per the relevant balance sheet date.

We use the following valuation methods and assumptions in calculating the market value of our derivative
financial instruments:

Currency forwards and currency swaps are valued at the forward exchange rate as of the relevant balance
sheet date. Options are valued using the Black Scholes or Binomial Models depending on their structure.
Instruments designed to hedge interest rate and commodity risks are valued by discounting future cash flows.
Discounting is based on customary market interest rates over the remaining term of the instruments. Swap
amounts from these hedging instruments are recorded against profit and loss at the time of payment or when
accrued at the relevant balance sheet date.

According to German GAAP, a negative valuation result of the relevant hedging transaction leads to a
provision for contingent losses, provided that no valuation unit has been created, while a positive valuation
result is not taken into account.

**SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GERMAN GAAP AND IFRS**

Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum have been prepared
on the basis of German GAAP, which differ in certain respects from IFRS. The following paragraphs
summarize certain significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS as of December 31, 2022.

The organizations that promulgate IFRS have ongoing projects that could have a significant impact on future
comparisons of German GAAP and IFRS. This description is not intended to provide a comprehensive
listing of all such differences specifically related to us or the industry in which we operate. IFRS are generally
more restrictive and more comprehensive than German GAAP regarding recognition and measurement of
transactions, account classification and presentation and disclosure requirements. We have not attempted to
identify all disclosure, presentation or classification differences that would affect the manner in which
transactions and events are presented in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

We have not prepared audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that the differences described below would, in fact, be the accounting principles creating
the greatest material differences between our consolidated financial statements prepared under German
GAAP and under IFRS. In addition, we cannot estimate the net effect that applying IFRS would have on our
results of operations or our financial position, or any part of them, in any of the presentations of financial
information in this offering memorandum. The effect of such differences may be material and, in particular, it
may be that the total shareholders’ equity (capital deficit) and net income prepared on the basis of IFRS
would be materially different due to these differences.

**Financial Statement Presentation**

Under IFRS, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on a current/non-current distinction of assets and
liabilities. IFRS requires the presentation of assets and liabilities in order of liquidity only when a liquidity
presentation provides information that is reliable and is more relevant than a current/non-current presentation.
Under German GAAP, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on the liquidity of the assets and


-----

liabilities. This results, for example, in the different presentation of financial assets and liabilities and deferred
taxes in the statement of financial position under IFRS and German GAAP.

Unlike IFRS, German GAAP does not require the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income
and it is very common (but not required) that the income statement under the German GAAP will be prepared
using the “nature of expense”method and not the “cost of sales”method, which is generally used in the IFRS
financial statements. In addition, the disclosures required in the explanatory notes to the financial statements
are far more extensive under IFRS than under German GAAP.

**Consolidation Principles**

Under IFRS, an entity (investor) is required to consolidate another entity (investee), depending on whether it
controls the investee. An investor controls an investee when it has a power over an investee, is exposed, or has
rights to the variable returns from its involvement and due to his power can influence the amount of these
variable returns. The consolidation conclusions under IFRS will not differ significantly from the German
GAAP regulations for the most straightforward entities. However, some differences may arise where there are
complex group structures or where specific entities have been established. Investors that are most likely
affected have their involvements, for example, in with the following entities:

- Entities with a dominant investor without a majority of the voting or similar rights and where the rest of
voting rights belongs to the widely dispersed shareholders (de facto control);

- Structured entities (formerly “special purpose entities”) where voting or similar rights are not the
dominant means to determine the power.

Under German GAAP, an investor is required to consolidate the investee if an investor holds the majority of
voting rights, enjoys the right to appoint or dismiss the majority of the management and supervisory board
members, enjoys the right to exercise a controlling influence on financial and operating policies or in substance
obtains the majority of risks and rewards of an investee that has a narrow, well defined purpose (“special
purpose entity”).

**Business Combination**

Under IFRS 3 acquisition related cost (transaction cost) that incurs to effect a business combination are
accounted as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.

Acquisition related costs are not part of the consideration transferred to the seller in return for the business;
they are not part of the fair value of the acquired business; they do not represent an asset of the acquirer.
Acquisition related costs represent services that have been rendered to and consumed by the acquirer. As
such, IFRS 3 states that they are accounted for as an expense when the acquirer consumes the related service.

Under German GAAP certain cost which have been incurred after the decision to acquire an entity qualify for
capitalization and form part of the acquisition cost (e.g. due diligence cost, consultancy cost for valuation
reports). All expenses incurred prior to the decision making have to be expensed as incurred.

Costs related to the issuance of financial liabilities are expensed as incurred. Optionally, interest like expenses
are capitalized and amortized over the term of the debt.

For purchase price allocation all identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries are
reflected at their fair value regardless of the level of minority share.

Under IFRS 3, goodwill acquired in a business combination, must be allocated to a cash generating unit
(CGU) or group(s) of CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows
that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

Under German GAAP goodwill is allocated to the respective business unit to which it refers.

Under IFRS goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and if there is an indication that
goodwill may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGU is compared with its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is defined as
the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of an
asset or CGU is less than its carrying amount, an entity should reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable
amount. The reduction is an impairment loss. For assets carried on the depreciated historical cost basis the
impairment loss should be recognized in profit or loss immediately. For assets that are carried at revalued


-----

amounts an impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. The loss is first set against any revaluation
surplus relating to the asset in other comprehensive income to the extent of the surplus and the remaining
balance of the loss (if any) is then treated as an expense in profit or loss.

Under German GAAP goodwill is amortized over its economic life. Goodwill should be reviewed for
impairment and its remaining useful life once a year. Goodwill is impaired if its carrying amount exceeds its
fair value.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Under IFRS, the recorded acquisition cost of property, plant and equipment includes appropriate
dismantling, removal and restoration costs. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset are capitalized as part of the
cost of that asset. Overhead costs, such as general and administrative costs and expenses for social services,
voluntary social benefits and company pensions are not part of the production cost. Under IFRS, individual
items within property, plant and equipment are frequently composed of different component parts with
varying useful lives or consumption patterns. These parts are individually replaced during the useful life of an
asset. Under IFRS, each such part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant
in relation to the total cost of the item is recognized and depreciated separately (component approach). Costs
of required and regular major inspections are capitalized and depreciated if it is probable that future economic
benefits associated with the item will flow to the reporting entity and the cost of the item can be measured
reliably. After initial recognition IFRS further offers an option to value items of property, plant and equipment
at either the (lower) cost of the item less any accumulated depreciation and impairment or at its fair value at
the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment.

Under German GAAP, property, plant and equipment is initially valued at purchase or production cost, the
latter may include general and administrative costs and expenses for social services, voluntary social benefits
and company pensions. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a
qualifying asset must be capitalized. The component approach is not specifically contemplated by German
GAAP rules, but its use for balance sheet purposes is generally permitted. Costs of regular major inspections
are recognized in the income statement as incurred. A revaluation model is not permitted. Costs of
demolishing or restoring an item of property, plant and equipment do not qualify for capitalization but are
required to be reported as provision over the item’s useful life. After initial recognition, property, plant and
equipment are accounted for at cost less any accumulated depreciation.

**Impairment of Assets**

Under IFRS, an impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less cost
of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset unless the asset
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.

Under German GAAP, an impairment loss for non-current assets must only be recorded if a permanent
impairment in value is anticipated. The concept of cash generating units is not applicable under German
GAAP, and the impairment loss is determined on an item by item basis. An impairment loss is to be recognized
when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.

**Provisions, Other Liabilities and Contingencies**

Some provisions in the financial statements under German GAAP will be required to be reported as other
liabilities in accordance with IFRS. Under IFRS, provisions are recognized if an enterprise has a present
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable (i.e., more likely than not to occur) that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. In cases where the outflow of economic resources is expected to occur, an obligation will be
reported as a liability. The discount rate used to determine the amount of any provisions is determined by
reference to a pre-tax interest rate for a risk-free obligation that matches the maturity of the liability to which
the provision relates.

Under German GAAP, the criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingencies are less detailed and
prescriptive than under IFRS. Accordingly, there is greater flexibility under German GAAP to record
provisions for onerous contracts and restructuring expenses. In addition, German GAAP estimates are
typically made in a more conservative manner. The recognition of a provision with a probability lower than
50% is possible. German GAAP requires the recording of provisions for deferred maintenance that is expected


-----

to be performed within three months after the end of the reporting period, uncertain liabilities and expected
losses from executory contracts. Long term provisions (i.e., with a maturity of more than one year) are
discounted using a maturity matched average market interest rate for the preceding seven years as published
by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).

**Valuation of Assets and Liabilities; Currency Translation**

Under IFRS, initial recognition and subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities—if qualified
as financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss—is required at its fair value. Foreign
currency receivables and liabilities are measured at fair value.

Under German GAAP, current financial assets are required to be recorded at acquisition cost and financial
liabilities are required to be recorded at repayment cost. Current receivables and liabilities in foreign currency
are measured at fair value. The valuation of non-current currency receivables and liabilities with a maturity
more than one year has to be in line with lower of cost or market principle and higher carrying amount at the
balance sheet date respectively.

**Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings; Prepaid Expenses**

Under IFRS, all interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of the
consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing
loans and borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Under German GAAP, interest bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at their repayment amounts.
Transaction costs, except for costs to be paid to the finance providers, are expensed as incurred. Only
equivalent to interest transaction costs paid to finance providers are deferred as prepaid expenses and
amortized on a straight line basis to interest expense.

**Sales, Trade Receivables**

Under German GAAP, the definition of “sales” includes all revenue derived from the regular business
activities of the reporting entity.

Under IFRS, “revenue from certain ancillary business activities is recorded as “other operating income”,
rather than “sales”.

Under German GAAP, valuation allowances for losses on individual trade receivables must be recorded. In
addition, a general provision for doubtful accounts—reflecting the general default risk of receivables—has to
be recorded.

Under IFRS, the recording of such a general provision for doubtful allowances would be prohibited.

**Leasing**

Under IFRS 16 all rent and leasing contracts are accounted on-balance as financial leases. The lessee has a
right-of-use asset and a respective lease liability.

The right-of-use asset is a lessee’s right to use an asset over the life of a lease. The asset is calculated as the
initial amount of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made to the lessor before the lease commencement
date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, minus any lease incentives received.

The amortization period for the right-of-use asset is beginning from the lease commencement date until the
earlier of the end of the lease term or the end of the useful life of the asset. An exception is when it is
reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise an option to purchase the asset, in which case the amortization
period is through the end of the asset’s useful life.

If a right-of-use asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment is immediately recorded, thereby reducing
the carrying amount of the asset. Its subsequent measurement is calculated as the carrying amount
immediately after the impairment transaction, minus any subsequent accumulated amortization.

At the termination of a lease, the right-of-use asset and associated lease liability are removed from the books
of the lessee. The difference between the two amounts is accounted for as a profit or loss at that time.

Under German GAAP, accounting for leases is mainly driven by tax regulations, so the lease contracts in
Germany typically consider such rules in order to avoid capitalization at the lessee level. These rules differ
from the IFRS rules in several respects.


-----

**Provisions for Pensions**

Under IFRS, provisions for defined benefit pension obligations are accounted for under the projected unit
credit method. The defined benefit obligation is measured using various actuarial assumptions, including
assumptions as to future compensation and benefits levels. Under IFRS, the discount rate reflects the long
term view of the plan and not current rates that could be used to settle the pension obligation. This discount
rate is derived at the reporting date based on then current capital market conditions. Under one of the options
provided by IFRS, remeasurement gains and losses that result from changes in actuarial assumptions
(including changes in mortality tables) or actual experience that differs from the underlying assumptions do
not require recognition of gains and losses as components of net pension cost of the period in which they
arise. Rather they are recognized in other comprehensive income, which will never be reclassified in profit or
loss in the future.

Pension reserves under German GAAP are also be accounted for under the projected unit credit method since
the enactment of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act in 2009. Under German GAAP, the
discount rate used represents a maturity matched ten year average market derived interest rate. Alternatively
provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be discounted at an interest rate with a 15 year maturity
at the respective balance sheet date. The interest rates to be applied are published by the Federal Bank of
Germany. In addition, German GAAP requires recognition of the remeasurement gain or losses in profit and
loss and not as other comprehensive income as required under IFRS.

**Deferred Taxes**

Deferred tax assets (DTA) and deferred tax liabilities (DTL) are the income taxes recoverable or payable in
future years. They are mainly based on the taxable or deductible temporary differences between the carrying
amount of an asset or liability and the respective tax base. Due to the IFRS accounting principles, the carrying
amount of an asset or liability can differ from the amount under German GAAP. Accordingly the respective
deferred tax assets and liabilities change as well.

Under German GAAP, net DTL must be recognized in full, while the recognition of net DTA is optional.
Unlike German GAAP, IFRS does not provide an option to capitalize net DTA and, therefore, both net DTA
and net DTL have to be recognized in the respective period.

Under IFRS, DTA shall also be recognized for tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profit will be available. Under German GAAP, the capitalization of DTA for loss carryforward
shall only be taken into consideration if the tax benefit from the tax loss carryforward can be expected to be
recovered within the next five years.

**Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging**

Under IFRS, derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value
(mark to market). Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to
the income statement, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognized in other
comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss for the period when the forecast transaction being
hedged occurs. Under IFRS, the criteria to be met to qualify for hedge accounting are quite strict. This
includes stringent documentation requirements.

Under German GAAP, there is more flexibility to include forecast transactions in hedge accounting. Further,
there is no need to separately account for fair values of derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting (net hedge presentation method).

**EUROPEAN TISSUE MARKET**

Germany is the biggest Western European market for tissue products and comprised approximately 21% of
the Western European market with a demand of 1,467,000 tons in 2021. The Western European market
experienced a growth of 0.7% per annum in tissue consumption between 2011 and 2021 on average. The
demand for tissue products in the region is expected to grow broadly in line with historical growth levels
between 2021 and 2031 according to the RISI Report estimates. This increasing demand is expected to be
driven by population growth, demographic changes, development in tissue quality (e.g., the shift from two-ply
to three or four-ply products and softer toilet tissue despite of reduced fiber quantity per sheet), new product
specifications, limited substitution of products and increases in product penetration levels.

We also compete in the Eastern European market for tissue products with a sizeable presence in Poland which
is the second biggest market in the region and comprised approximately 25.6% of the Eastern European
market with a demand of 634,000 tons in 2021. The Eastern European market registered a growth of
approximately 5% per annum in tissue consumption between 2011 and 2021 on average. According to the
RISI Report, the demand for tissue products in the Eastern European market is expected to grow continually
at a higher average annual rate between 2021 and 2031 (+2.8% p.a.), but will not continue to outgrow Western
Europe between 2021 and 2031 as it has done in past with a 1.1% expected growth rate during the same time
period. Still, the higher demand is expected to be driven by economic growth, population developments,
increasing urbanization, the penetration of Western European retailers into the Eastern European retail
market and the increase of per capita consumption levels closer to average Western European levels, partly
driven by the expansion of Western European retailers in Eastern Europe.

In Western Europe, average per capita consumption increased from 12.2 kg in 1998 to 15.9 kg in 2021, which,
however, was still approximately 10 kg less than the per capita consumption in North America. Austria led the
region with a per capita consumption of 20.0 kg while Germany experienced a per capita consumption of
17.4 kg in 2021. In Eastern Europe, average per capita consumption increased from 1.7 kg in 1998 to 7.6 kg in
2021, which, however, was still significantly less than the levels in Western Europe and North America.

The European tissue market can be divided into two main market segments: the Consumer (or at-home)
segment which represented approximately 75% of total European demand of 9,312,000 tons in 2021 and the
AfH segment, which constituted approximately 25% of the 2021 demand.

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the Consumer and the AfH segments differently, specifically at the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Whereas the Consumer segment benefited from strong sales
due to panic hoarding of household necessities incl. toilet paper and tissue products, the AfH segment was
negatively impacted by the lockdowns, home-office working and limited public / recreational traffic.
Meanwhile the observed changes normalized again to pre-crisis behavior.

**CONSUMER SEGMENT**

The Consumer segment accounted for approximately 74% of tissue consumption in Western Europe in 2021.
The upgrading of product quality has helped the Consumer segment to grow further, among others, through
the shift towards three and four-ply toilet tissue in Central European countries such as Germany, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Austria. The Consumer segment experienced an average annual growth of 1.0% in
demand during 2011 and 2021 and is expected to grow by an annual growth rate of 0.9% between 2021 and
2031 according to the RISI Report. Toilet tissue is the biggest end-market product within the Consumer
segment followed by toweling, which represented approximately 64% and 23%, respectively, of the total
consumption in the segment in Western Europe in 2021.

In Eastern Europe, the Consumer segment accounted for approximately 79% of tissue consumption in 2021.
The segment experienced an average annual growth of 4.8% in demand during 2011 and 2021 and is expected
to grow at a lower average annual growth rate of 2.4% between 2021 and 2031 according to the RISI Report.
Toilet tissue dominates the Consumer segment, accounting for 72% of total consumption in 2021.

**AWAY-FROM-HOME (AFH) SEGMENT**

Unlike the Consumer segment, AfH products are not delivered to the end customer via larger retailers, but via
typically smaller, regional distributors specialized in professional hygiene solutions. These distributors serve
end customers such as industrial companies, hotels, restaurants, health care providers and other customers
with public washrooms.


-----

The AfH segment accounted for the remaining 26% of tissue consumption in Western Europe in 2021. The
AfH segment experienced an average annual growth of 0.1% in demand between 2011 and 2021 and is
expected to grow at an average annual growth rate of 1.9% between 2021 and 2031 according to the RISI
Report. Hand towels represent the biggest end-market product within the AfH segment and represented 46%
of total consumption within the segment in 2021.

In Eastern Europe, the AfH segment accounted for approximately 21% of tissue consumption in 2021. The
segment registered an average annual growth of 4.0% in demand during 2011 and 2021 and is expected to
grow at an average annual growth rate of 4.1% between 2021 and 2031, according to the RISI Report. Toweling
dominated consumption within the AfH segment and accounted for 38% of total consumption in 2021.

**PRIVATE LABEL VS. BRANDED**


The tissue industry is further classified between private label and branded products. Private label tissue
products are marketed and sold through retail stores under retailers’ in-house labels. The share of private
label products has shown continued growth in most European countries with currently approximately 71.5%
of total volume in tissue products being sold under private labels across main Western European consumer
tissue markets in 2022. This is partly driven by the continued expansion of European retailers, especially
discounters. Germany has one of the highest shares of private label products as compared to branded products
in Europe, with 78.2% share in 2022. However, given that the share of retailer labels is so high in Germany, the
share of private labels declined in the recent four years, as some of the main players such as Essity and Sofidel
have made strong efforts to increase sales of their branded products. In general, the private label sector has
proven to be more resilient than branded products during economic downturns.

Differences exist between countries in their mix of private label versus branded tissue products due to the
concentration (and in effect, negotiating power) of retailers, the position of discounters in the distribution
chain, the traditional market dominance of a few brand owners, product margins and pricing decisions, the
level of brand advertising and consumer attitudes.

In Western Europe, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Greece have the highest share of private
label products as compared to branded products (all around 80%), while Finland, Norway, Sweden and Italy
have a significantly higher share of branded products. The average Western European volume share of private
labels increased from 54.6% in 2004 to around 71.5% in 2022 when considering all consumer tissue product
categories. The chart below shows the development of private labels in recent years.

Switzerland, Denmark, Finland and Norway

In Eastern Europe, private label shares are already at a rather high level in the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Hungary, and Poland. This is understandable as retailing is well concentrated in the hands of international
chains. The private label share seems to be particularly high in kitchen towels, which resembles the situation in
Western Europe. The private label share of Poland by volume for toilet tissue, kitchen rolls, facial tissue and
table napkins in 2022 was 78.5%, 76.6%, 78.0% and 47.2% respectively, according to the RISI Report.


**COMPETITION**

Private label tissue manufacturers compete by way of tender procedures conducted by the respective retailers
on, currently, a three to six months basis. Tissue manufacturers with the best tenders would typically be
invited to a subsequent round of negotiations where prices are further discussed and ultimately agreed.


-----

**Western Europe**

In Western Europe, the top five players account for approximately 60% of the tissue product market (across
at-home, away-from-home, private label and branded products) in 2022. Essity continues to be the largest
Western European tissue supplier with a production capacity share of approximately 26.1% according to the
RISI Report. Wepa currently ranks third in Western Europe with a capacity share of approximately 10.2%
according to RISI.

There has been an ongoing consolidation process in the Western European tissue industry and the industry
has experienced several ownership changes since 2007. The degree of overall consolidation increased until
2012 but has since declined due to some mill closures and divestments to other investors. Notable transactions
include SCA’s (now Essity) acquisition of Georgia-Pacific’s European tissue business in 2012, which created a
clear market leader; Sofidel’s acquisition of LPC Group of the United Kingdom in 2010, which strengthened
Sofidel’s position in the UK market and provided access to the Nordic region and SCA’s (now Essity)
acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s entire European tissue operations in 2007. Similarly, we acquired most of
the assets of Kartogroup in 2009. In 2015, we acquired the former Lucart S.p.a. plant in Troyes, France. The
takeover of Van Houtum with a production site in Swalmen, the Netherlands followed in 2017. In 2018, we
acquired the remaining 50% share in the former joint venture Northwood & Wepa with a production plant in
Bridgend. In the second quarter of 2020, Italian Cartiere Carrara acquired Ideal Cart in Sermoneta from
Carind Goup. It also had acquired the converting assets under the name Carind and another converter CRC
at the beginning of 2020. In the second half of 2020, Kimberly-Clark announced its plan to sell its Swiss
paper mill in Niederbipp. The Queck family took over the mill with an annual capacity of 50,000 tons, which
now continues to operate as Tela GmbH after the transaction. In Germany, JUNG INV became the sole
owner of the Reisholz tissue mill following the self-administration phase of Hakle GmbH in late 2022 and
Hakle’s trademark rights were sold to Sofidel. In April 2023, Essity announced the strategic review of its stake
in Vinda, the listed Asian hygiene company, and its European Consumer Tissue Private Label business (the
latter with sales of approximately SEK 9.8 billion in 2022). Meanwhile Essity announced in December 2023
that it had concluded its strategic review and intended to maintain its European Consumer Tissue Private
Label business.

**Eastern Europe**

Abris Capital is currently the largest supplier of tissue products in Eastern Europe with an approximate 9.4%
share of production capacity. Hayat Kimya and Industrie Cartarie Tronchetti (ICT) are currently the second
and third largest suppliers of tissue products in Eastern Europe, each with a market share of 6.9%.

Unlike Western Europe, the Eastern European market is relatively fragmented with even the largest producer
controlling less than 10% of the region’s capacity. The top five manufacturers (Abris Capital, Hayat Kimya,
ICT, SHP Group and Metsä Tissue) have a combined market share of approximately 35%.

Between 2011 and 2021, Western European tissue production grew by about 397,000 tons. During the same
period, production in Italy, Germany and Portugal increased substantially with further investments in the


-----

area, resulting in these three countries accounting for the highest production increases, followed by France
and Spain. The total installed tissue production capacity in Western Europe by the end of 2022 was
8.05 million tons. Western Europe was a small net exporter in 2012–2013, but became a net importer thereafter,
largely due to the collapse in exports to Russia. The increase in production capacity coupled with the
weakening of the Russian ruble exchange rate had contributed to the reduced importing needs in Russia. It is
assumed that the region will remain a marginal net importer in the coming years. As a result, the average
capacity utilization rate is expected to remain low at 85-86% in 2023–2026.

**Eastern Europe**


Eastern European tissue production grew from 1.1 million tons in 2006 to 3.02 million tons in 2022,
representing about 5% of global consumption, according to the RISI Report. The increase took place mainly
in Russia, followed by Poland, Romania and Hungary. Eastern Europe exported more tissue than it imported
until the mid-1990s, with Western Europe as the main destination. Eastern Europe eventually became a net
importer of tissue products due to the increasing demand for imports of high-quality products. However, new
capacities in Russia, Romania and Poland dampened this trend and by 2017 regional trade was balanced and
had remained in a balanced corridor through the years until 2020 before net imports increased again in 2021.
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in extra demand, but also delayed projects. As a result, capacity utilization
improved to almost 87% in 2020, but it returned to normal levels of 84% in 2021 and 82% in 2022. The impact
of new production capacities that have recently begun operations or are expected to begin operations in 2024
is expected to affect capacity utilization rates in the coming years. Therefore, operating rates are expected to
remain below 85% until 2025 even if there will be no additional projects.

**RAW MATERIAL MARKET**

**Pulp**


Pulp is one of the principal raw materials required to manufacture tissue paper and is traded on the
international market. Even though wood is the dominating source of fiber, pulp can also be produced from
“non-wood-plants. Wood pulp is classified according to the type of wood used (hardwood or softwood), the
manner in which it is processed (chemical or mechanical process), whether it is bleached, and how it is
bleached. Non-wood-pulps do not assume a significant role in Europe, but are used extensively in other
regions, particularly in China. Tissue paper can also be manufactured from recycled fiber.

Bleached chemical pulp (“BCP”), more commonly known as “white pulp” includes all bleached kraft and
sulphite pulp. Its end-uses are primarily printing and writing papers and tissue. There are several subgrades
used to define specific pulp qualities and this can be commonly split into two categories i.e., Bleached
Softwood Kraft Pulp (“BSKP”) and Bleached Hardwood Kraft Pulp (“BSKP”). Northern Bleached
Softwood Kraft (“NBSK”), otherwise known as BSKP-northern is part of the bleached softwood kraft family
produced exclusively from softwood trees in Canada and the Nordic countries. BSKP is a more generic
nomenclature for other short fiber hardwood species. Bleached Eucalyptus Kraft pulp (“BEKP”) is the
benchmark grade of short fiber chemical pulp exported globally. End products made from long-fiber BSKP
are considerably stronger than short-fiber BEKP since an increase in fiber length translates into more interfiber bonding which implies greater strength of the fibrous network materials.

In recent years, the tissue industry has responded to market price developments for the major pulp grades by
gradually changing the mix of different grades, provided that the quality of the paper grade was not affected
by these technical changes. As shown below, hardwood grades are usually cheaper than softwood grades, so
we have increased the hardwood share in our virgin fiber furnish to approximately 70%, whereas in 2009, it
was less than 50%. This behavior can also be observed in other parts of the industry and the supplier base has


-----

reacted by adding more hardwood production capacity to the market. However, it is important to note that
not only the price but also the availability of pulp grades is a factor.

Our products come in a variety of materials including pure pulp paper, recycled paper, and hybrid solutions
(combination of pure pulp and recycle fibers). With the increasing focus on sustainability and circular
economy, there is a heightened focus on recycled paper-based, recycled fibers and alternative virgin fibers as
raw materials. We have set the goal of reducing our environmental footprint relating to fiber raw materials by
25% by using at least 60% recovered fibers and virgin fiber alternatives by 2030. Although there is an ongoing
effort of diversifying our raw material portfolio, there is still a high reliance on traditional cellulose virgin
fibers in the short to medium term.

According to Hawkins Wright (“Outlook for Market Pulp”, August 2023), the BCP shipments were
60.5 million tons in 2022 and are forecasted to increase by 0.9 million tons over the course of 2022 and 2023.
Market pulp demand remains resilient with the continued growth in tissue and hygiene sectors despite the
secular decline in printing & writing industry (“P&W”). In 2022, tissue has become the largest end user of
bleached chemical pulp, accounting for 43% of global BCP shipments and expected to reach 45% of the
supply by end of 2023, from a share of 33% in 2012. Hawkins Wright forecasted a continued growth in global
tissue production of around 2.5-3% over the forecast period, which marks a key driver to BCP demand. As
consumer preference for high quality tissue grows, most of the growth has been in virgin fiber content tissue.

Based on Hawkins Wright estimates, the tissue industry will account for around 46% of global BCP sales by
2027, approximately 30 million tons, offsetting a 2.4 million tons contraction in the P&W sector to 10 million
tons, which is equivalent to around 15% of the market.

Along with the ever-increasing demand for paper in emerging markets, especially Asia, the global production
capacity for market pulp has grown significantly. Those capacity additions have been closely adjusted to the
market growth, so no major oversupply was observed in the past years, even though that had been expected by
the leading analysts at certain stages. Changing dynamics of demand growth and contraction in different
parts of the world, combined with overarching effects such as the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the resulting global supply chain disruptions, are causing undersupply even at times when the market should
be well balanced.

The supply-demand ratio declined to 85% in 2022 and is projected to further decrease to around 82% and 83%
in 2023 and 2024 respectively. Due to insufficient investments in softwood mills, the sector is highly susceptible
to unexpected mechanical shutdowns. This vulnerability is expected to come into focus over the upcoming
period as lead producers are pressured by the tough market conditions to cut back on maintenance capital
expenditure. The softwood industry is also facing challenges from a fiber supply perspective, particularly in
Western Canada, where operating efficiencies have been undermined by indefinite shutdowns or permanent
closures of mills and lines over the course of 2022-2023, causing the ratio to decline before the market
rebalances by the end of 2024. According to Hawkins Wright (“Outlook for Market Pulp”, October 2023),
two out of three NBSK grade mill closures in 2023 are attributed to Canada, following West Fraser’s
announcement to close Hinton’s BSKP grade mill in Canada in the fourth quarter of 2022.

The BHKP ratio is shown fluctuating within a range of 87-88%, as many pulp production projects are expected
to be realized throughout 2023-2026. This will drive prices below marginal cost and stimulate some capacity
closure or additional demand through substitution.

Although the supply-demand ratio is closely correlated with prices, the threshold that constitutes a balanced
market has fallen in recent years as logistical constraints and unforeseen mechanical outages have regularly
increased. This was particularly evident during the supply-side stress during 2021 and 2022, when prices rose
even though the ratio stood at 88-89% and market conditions were actually much tighter than the implied
headline ratio.

As illustrated in the graph above, the weak capacity growth during 2020 and 2021 was followed by supply
chain constraints caused by major production disruptions, i.e. various mill closures and conversions to
unbleached or dissolving pulp, offsetting any growth. Market pulp capacity growth has rebuilt pace in 2022
and is expected to continue to accelerate during 2024, backed by the normalization of the supply chain.
Although capacity growth has resumed, supply side vulnerability could be a prolonged issue with project
delays and ongoing logistical problems, not to mention that there have been more recent outages attributed to
extreme weather events. However, Hawkins Wright’s forecast believes that the growing occurrence of supplyside issues and the current pricing dynamics will lead to a quicker restoration of a balanced BCP market up to
90-91%.

**RAW MATERIAL PRICES**


With market pulp being the key raw material for tissue, the price development of market pulp has a
considerable influence on the manufacturing costs of tissue paper. However, changes in pulp prices can only
pass through with a certain time lag, considering the duration of supply agreements for tissue products. After
pulp markets have recently shown significant relief from their all-time-highs during 2023, we expect that the
market will find a new balance on higher than current price levels.

After approximately a year of price erosion and a leveling out in August, prices for both the benchmark pulp
grades started to move up in September 2023 despite the precarious condition of the European pulp market.
The situation on the NBSK market is not particularly defined, with sources noting that upticks in Chinese
market were responsible for driving price momentum in Europe as end-use markets in Europe remain weak.
While the upward trend is also observed in BEKP prices, pulp sellers were experiencing additional volume
requests from customers and hence were prepared to supply to regions with higher returns.

While pulp prices started to increase in September, there is general a mixed outlook for paper market in
Europe going into Q4 with points of concern surrounding demand recovery and developments in China.

**RECOVERED PAPER**

Recovered paper is the alternative raw material to virgin fiber in manufacturing tissue paper and is a globally
traded commodity. The use of recovered paper in the production of tissue presents several advantages,
including typically lower costs and sustainability aspects. Even though a world market does exist, the
international trading activity is prone to exchange rates, local supply and demand relationships and quality
requirements. Import restriction of untreated recovered paper into Asia and particularly China have caused
significant oversupply in certain paper grades in the rest of the world and a change in trade patterns. This,
however, predominantly concerns low grade recovered paper that is typically still not commonly used in tissue
production, but also influenced better grades and secured their availability in their homelands.

Through acquisitions, we have strategically developed the segment of recovered paper-based tissue. In addition
to Germany, we obtained a meaningful position as a consumer of recovered paper in the Netherlands and
France. Still Germany is the most important source of recyclable material, the price differences for comparable
paper grades are limited in the rest of Europe. The graph below illustrates the price development of the main
recovered paper grades between 2017 and 2023. Again, the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting the paper
markets severely. It changed the consumption patterns, soon followed by an adaptation of production, and
interrupted the collection of fresh recovered paper. Consequently, the markets were undersupplied and reacted
with a price rally, only to collapse again shortly after. By now, prices for better grades have normalized,
however they have massively decreased in availability. Lower grades are currently recovering from a period of
prices that were touching the cost of collection at times or even negative prices. There is ample availability of
lower grades and is availability is expected to exceed that of the traditionally preferred paper grades for tissue
making. This development also supports our sustainability strategy that led to the introduction of tissue
paper that is produced from such lower grades.

**BUSINESS**

**OUR COMPANY**

We are a leading European, family-owned producer and supplier of tissue products with a market share (by
production volumes) of 8.1% in Europe and 10.2% in Western Europe, both according to RISI. Based on our
Internal Private Label Mapping 2022, we believe we are the leading private label consumer tissue paper
producer in our core markets of Germany, the BeNeLux region, France and Italy with a market share, by
volume, between approximately 17-32% in these markets. In addition, we believe we are the second largest
private label consumer tissue paper producer in the UK and the third largest in Poland. We are convinced we
differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our strong and future-oriented commitment to the
European tissue paper business, with a clear focus on sustainability, product innovation and continuous
strategic investments in our asset base.

Headquartered in Arnsberg, Germany, we offer a full range of folded and rolled tissue products such as toilet
paper, kitchen towels, handkerchiefs, hand towels, facial tissues, napkins, industrial paper rolls and paper
towels as well as semi-finished products (i.e. jumbo reels and de-inked pulp). We produce our tissue products
on 22 paper machines and over 80 converting lines. Our fourteen production sites are located strategically
across Europe in Germany, Italy, France, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and we had an
average of 3,785 employees in 2022. Our production capacities make us the third largest producer of tissue
products (by volume) in the European tissue market, a market exhibiting resilient demand characteristics with
low product substitution risk. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have an installed tissue paper
production capacity of 850,000 tons and an installed tissue paper converting capacity of 847,000 tons to
convert tissue paper into tissue products. Approximately 48% of our production capacity and 45% of our
converting capacity is located in Germany, our core market and Europe’s largest tissue market. We also own
technologically advanced facilities for the production of de-inked pulp from recovered paper, with an annual
capacity of more than 390,000 tons. Due to this and our long-standing focus on sustainable products and
production, we believe we are the largest producer of tissue products from recovered paper and hybrid
products in Europe, with total sales of €1,636.4 million in 2022. In the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2023, we sold 724,000 tons of finished tissue products, 35,000 tons of de-inked pulp and 29,000
tons of jumbo reels across Europe, which generated €1,865.1 million and €318.2 million of sales and EBITDA,
respectively, in such period.

We operate our business primarily through our two business units Consumer and Professional. In our
Consumer business unit, we are a private-label specialist for European retailers, selling our tissue products
branded under our retail customers’ own labels. Our Professional business unit with the brands BlackSatino
and Satino by WEPA stands for sustainable and professional hygiene solutions for large commercial and
institutional customers, served through leading distributors. In addition to our two core business units, and in
line with our vision to be the most sustainable, best-in-class partner for personal and professional hygiene
solutions, we have recently set up a “New Business Areas” business unit, focusing on the expansion of our
product and service portfolio, in particular through innovation, e-commerce and circular economy.

Our Consumer business unit, which represented 85% of our sales from finished products in our financial year
2022 and 86% of our sales from finished products in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023,
offers a full range of consumer tissue products: toilet paper, kitchen towels, facial tissues, handkerchiefs and
napkins. While the key focus of our Consumer business unit is on the private label sector, we also market some
products under our own brands such as Mach m!t…, Comprami, Perla and Scala. Our Professional business
unit, which has a more regional focus within Central Europe and Poland, focuses on tissue products for large
commercial and institutional customers, such as government agencies, hotels, restaurants, private enterprises,
hospitals and other healthcare providers. It offers a broad range of tissue products with a focus on our own
brands Satino by WEPA and BlackSatino, including toilet paper and paper towels, industrial rolls, kitchen
rolls as well as accessories like comprehensive dispenser systems for washrooms. In addition to the brand
business, our Professional business unit offers also private label and unbranded products. In both
business units, we also generate revenues from the sale of semi-finished products, such as de-inked pulp and
jumbo reels, with the amount of such sales varying and primarily depending on our own internal demand.

**OUR STRENGTHS**

We believe that we benefit from the following strengths.

**_Leading Market Positions in Attractive and Resilient End-Markets_**

We are the third largest producer by volume of tissue products in Western Europe, having increased our
market share in Europe from 6.9% in 2015 to 8.1% in 2022 according to RISI. In addition, we believe we are
the largest producer of private label consumer tissue products across our core markets, by volume. For
example, in our home market Germany, which is also our biggest market, we are the largest private label
consumer tissue producer, holding a market share of 28.5% by volume, and we also believe we hold leading
market positions in private label consumer tissue production in each of our other core markets France (first
by capacity, holding a market share of 32.9%), the BeNeLux region (first by capacity, holding a market share
of 27.6%), Italy (first by capacity, holding a market share of 16.8%), the United Kingdom (second by capacity,


-----

holding a market share of 22.1%) and Poland (third by capacity, holding a market share of 16.9%), all based
on our Internal Private Label Mapping 2022. With regard to sustainable tissue products, we believe we are the
largest producer of tissue products from recovered paper and hybrid products in Europe, with total volumes
of approximately 294,000 tons in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023. Above all, we believe
that our significant existing scale, purchasing power, geographic coverage and strategically well-positioned
production sites give us a competitive advantage over smaller players and enhance our ability to compete with
other leading players in these markets more effectively. Additionally, we believe our competitive position
profits from our clear and future-oriented commitment to the European private label segment in the Consumer
business unit, focusing on long-term strategic customer relations, providing supply reliability, product
innovations and improvement potential for our customers’ sustainability footprint.

Our core tissue products benefit from utility-like consumer demand, high penetration rates, low substitution
risk and resilient demand characteristics. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a generally
increased awareness of hygiene and, as a result, demand for tissue products. Tissue consumption has seen
stable growth rates in Western Europe and strong growth rates in Eastern Europe. According to RISI,
consumption of tissue products in Western Europe grew by an average of 0.7% per annum and in Eastern
Europe by an average of 4.6% per annum between 2011 and 2021, to 6.8 million tons and 2.5 million tons of
tissue, respectively, in 2021. Demand for our core consumer tissue products increased by an average of 1.0%
per annum between 2011 and 2021 in Western Europe and by an average of 4.8% per annum in Eastern
Europe. For the period between 2021 and 2031, RISI expects the average growth rate of tissue consumption in
Western Europe to increase to 1.1% per annum, with growth rates in Eastern Europe expected to continue to
exceed rates in Western Europe, primarily due to the still significantly lower per capital consumption of tissue
paper in many Eastern European countries. We believe that demographic changes, increased urbanization,
higher product penetration levels, developments in tissue quality as well as increased pressure on our customers
to meet their self-imposed sustainability goals (where they are widely dependent on suppliers to provide
sustainably sourced raw materials due to the nature of the retail business model) will continue to underpin
demand growth for our products.

Unlike many of our competitors who serve both the branded and the private label sectors, our Consumer
business unit focuses on the key private label sector. Both in 2022 and the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2023, 97% of the sales of the Consumer business unit related to private label sales. The private
label sector represented 78.2% (by volume) of the overall German tissue market in 2022, according to RISI,
and also accounts for the majority of the overall tissue market in many other European markets in which we
operate. The overall market share of private label tissue products, by volume, relative to branded products, has
increased in Western Europe from 64.4% in 2015 to 71.5% in 2022, according to RISI. This increase has been
driven by the expansion of discount retailers, who primarily sell private label goods, an increased share of
private label tissue products being sold by non-discount retailers as well as by consumers substituting higherpriced branded products with lower-priced private label products of comparable quality.

We believe that our focus on the private label sector, combined with our significant existing scale and
purchasing power, our European network of fourteen strategically located production sites, our recent
investments into expanding and optimizing our production capabilities as well as our high quality and
sustainable products make us an attractive partner for large retailers (our key customers) across Europe and
positions us well to solidify our market leading positioning in the Consumer business, while capturing further
growth opportunities in this attractive and generally resilient market.

Our Professional business unit, which focuses on sales to large commercial and institutional customers, such
as government agencies, hotels, restaurants, private enterprises, hospitals and other healthcare providers,
generated €229.1 million in sales or 15.5% of our total sales from finished products in 2022. We believe that we
have a market share of 6% in the away-from-home segment in Western Europe. While tissue consumption in


-----

this segment has not yet reached pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, demand has started to recover, with a further
positive development and a positive outlook predicted by RISI. For the period from 2021 to 2026, RISI
expects the average growth rate of away-from-home tissue consumption in Western Europe to be 2.5% per
annum, and 1.3% per annum between 2026 and 2031, and therefore to exceed the expected growth rates in the
consumer tissue business. We believe that, with our strong existing Professional platform, combined with our
focus on sustainable products and our recent product innovations such as fibers from old corrugated board
(“OCC”) and miscanthus grass, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth of the away-from-home
tissue market and the market trend that customers request more sustainable products to meet their own
sustainability targets.

**_Strong and Long-Standing and Well-Diversified Customer Relationships_**

We have strong and long-standing customer relationships, with some of our key customer relationships dating
back more than 40 years, and the relationships with many of our top ten customers (by volume) in 2022
existing for more than 20 years. We have historically grown mostly with our large German customers as they
have expanded across Europe, but we have also significantly diversified our client base over the last decade
both by acquiring businesses with an existing customer-base in several of the markets in which we operate
today and by successfully entering into new relationships with key customers in our markets.

Our growing geographic coverage, our production and supply chain excellence as well as our significant
investments into expanding and optimizing our production capacities, have allowed us to gain new customers
and to strengthen the relationship with existing customers. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we
supply approximately 460 customers across our Consumer and Professional business units and we have welldiversified customer relationships. In our Consumer business unit, our customers include Aldi, dm, Edeka,
Lidl, Müller, Netto and REWE in Germany, Auchan, Carrefour, Casino, Intermarché and Leclerc in France,
Esselunga and Eurospin in Italy, Biedronka in Poland, Aldi, Coop and Tesco in the United Kingdom and
Colruyt and Superunie in the BeNeLux region. In addition, we supply IKEA worldwide with napkins. Our
Professional business unit serves leading distributors in the professional hygiene sector, such as GVS eG,
igefa, Abena, Metro Cash & Carry, CWS and MTS, cash & carry wholesalers as well as distributors for office
supplies.

As a result of our significant volume growth over the last decade, we have been able to further diversify our
customer base and the relative portion of our sales to our long-standing largest customer Lidl has decreased
to 16% of our total sales in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to historic levels of
25% in 2012. Overall, we achieved this diversification without losing significant volumes from any of our key
customers.

**Top 10 Customers Q3 LTM 2023**

Tesco 7%


Others 48%


Rewe 5%

Edeka 5%

In addition to diversification in our customer base, we are also diversified from a geographical perspective.
While our total sales of finished products in the DACH region amounted to 39% in the twelve-month period
ended September 30, 2023, France, the BeNeLux region, the UK, Italy and Poland each accounted for 17%,
14%, 14%, 7% and 5%, respectively, during such period. We believe that our geographic diversification is and
has been an advantage compared to other, more regional competitors, particularly during the COVID-19
pandemic and the 2022 energy crisis. During these crises, we were able to balance our production across our
European mills, avoiding the need to outsource production externally.

We believe our performance and reliability throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and periods marked by
extreme energy price peaks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at times forced certain other
market participants to reduce or suspend product deliveries, has further strengthened our reputation. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to demonstrate to our customers that we are a reliable, innovative and
transparent partner, ensuring both supply security and solid quality standards, while certain of our
competitors were not able to comply with their contractual supply commitments. At the same time, in light of
the significant supply chain issues in the market and tissue producers suffering from high energy costs, our
customers increasingly realized the value of long-term and fair arrangements with reliable and resilient
suppliers. We closely partnered with many of our customers to mitigate the negative consequences of the
energy crisis on various stakeholders, including our customers and their end consumers. As part of this
process, for many of our customers, we have been able to shorten the price cycles from previously one year to
periods of three to six months, allowing for a faster pass through of input cost increases to our customers.

In addition, we also believe that our ability to supply high quality, cost efficient and innovative products has
enabled us to benefit from a continuing trend among major retailers to consolidate their supplier bases and
work with larger partners that have the required scale, competencies and capacity to supply them efficiently
with a consistent quality across their markets and with partners that can enable them to execute their
sustainability strategy. In many instances, we are operating as a fundamental part of the supply chains of our
key customers, by improving their inventory management, security of supply and customer service. As part of
our new “concept supplier” strategy, and as further described under “—Our Strategy—Partner of Choice for
_Our Customers”, we offer the relevant customers cross-functional collaboration and to closely align our_
strategic plans with their strategic priorities, in particular in relation to the introduction and development of
new sustainable and/or innovative products, customer brands and value-added services.

**_Innovation Leader with a long-standing Focus on Sustainable Products and Production_**

As early as 1983, we began producing recycled tissue paper and subsequently started to invest significantly in
facilities for the recycling of recovered paper and in developing recycled tissue products. In 2010, we were the
first tissue producer in Europe to launch a range of high quality “hybrid” toilet paper and kitchen towels
based on fresh fiber, but with a minimum of 30% of recycled fiber content added to the raw material mix.
Over the years, we have gained significant additional expertise in recycled and hybrid products, be it from
improved quality (i.e. brightness, softness), different input fibers, including most recently OCC, and flexible
hybrid grades with different fiber shares of different fresh fibers like pulp or from miscanthus grass. Today, we
believe we are the leading producer of tissue products from recovered paper and hybrid products in Europe by
volume. Our leading market position in the field of recycled and hybrid tissue products is supported by our
well-invested asset base for the recycling of recovered paper in Arnsberg, Giershagen, Mainz and Kriebstein,
Germany, Swalmen, the Netherlands, Piechowice, Poland and Château-Thierry, France, with a total annual
stock preparation capacity of more than 390,000 tons of de-inked pulp.

In addition to our strong focus on recovered paper for the production of tissue paper, we have also become an
innovation leader for sustainable tissue products and operations. Driven by an increasing dependency of our
retail customers on their suppliers to meet their own sustainability goals and following a continuously
increasing end-consumer demand in products from sustainable fibers, we have focused on the development of
new sustainable tissue products as part of our 4+1 sustainability strategy, as further described under “—Our
_Strategy—Strong Commitment to Sustainability”. For example, we have successfully launched tissue products_
made from OCC, a fiber which can be reused multiple times before becoming tissue fiber, which in most cases
is also the end-use, and which has, as a recycled fiber, a reduced ecological footprint of 70% compared to pure
pulp. Due to steadily shrinking availability of high bright graphic paper for recycling purposes, products


-----

made from OCC have a significant potential for further growth. We have also launched a new fiber production
based on miscanthus grass. Miscanthus grass can be grown on fields that are no longer suitable for agriculture
due to exhausted soil. It can grow on those fields for several years, resulting in a better environmental footprint
compared to wood plantations. Our current test line for the production of miscanthus grass-based fibers has
a capacity of 350 tons per annum. In light of the significant potential of such fiber and the fact that we are
already successfully distributing our first miscanthus-based products, we have recently started the construction
of a production line with an annual production capacity of 8,000 tons. The ramp-up of this production line is
expected for 2025.

As a result of our long-standing focus on sustainable tissue products and operations, we believe we are
particularly well-positioned to benefit from demand trends for more sustainable products. In the twelvemonth period ended September 30, 2023, approximately 50% of the finished products produced by us
consisted of recycled or hybrid tissue products, with 22.2% of our finished products being recycled paperbased products (of which 0.6%, or approximately 4,700 tons, related to our new OCC-based products in the
first year of introduction) and 25.4% being hybrid paper products. We further sold 35,000 tons of de-inked
pulp in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023. In addition to the clear benefits of recycled and
hybrid tissue products from an ecological and sustainability perspective, we believe that our strength and
expertise in recycled and (in particular) hybrid tissue products give us significant commercial advantages. It
allows us to diversify our product portfolio, helps us balance fluctuations in the price of raw materials (i.e.
soften the impact of price increases for fresh fiber) and opens up opportunities to improve our margins as well
as our customers´ margins for value added by incorporating recycled fiber into higher quality/value products
(i.e. by convincing customers to partially substitute lower quality recycled tissue products with hybrid or OCC
products). Our efforts producing recycled and hybrid tissue products have been validated with various ecolabels and certifications for our products, such as the EU Ecolabel, the “Blue Angel” (“Blauer Engel”) label in
Germany, the European Eco Label and the Nordic Swan for Europe. Furthermore, we were also awarded with
a Silver Star award in EcoVadis’s sustainability rating, our miscanthus-based product line BlackSatino
GreenGrow has been awarded with the Purus Innovation Award 2023 and our Satino PureSoft products,
made from OCC, have been awarded with the German Bundespreis Ecodesign 2023 award.

**_Efficient Production via Well-Invested and Strategically Located Asset Base_**

We operate fourteen production sites, including one focused solely on raw-material production (de-inked
pulp), strategically located across Europe in Germany, Italy, France, Poland, the Netherlands and the UK.
This network largely mirrors the footprint of our key pan-European customers and thus enables us to supply
our customers in a timely, cost-effective manner. Mainly due to disproportionally high freight costs relative to
the value of products shipped, it is not economical for participants in our industry to supply customers more
than a certain distance from a particular production site. The alignment of our production sites with the
geographic footprint of our major customers is therefore an important competitive advantage. In addition,
our geographic footprint enables us to reduce delivery times and, typically, to guarantee delivery to our
customers within a short and competitive time from the receipt of an order. Our geographic footprint also
permits us to optimize our inventories by shortening the supply chain which, in turn, lowers our storage and
transportation costs. It further allows us to align our individual production sites with the preferences of endcustomers in specific regions, which improves our product offering, service quality, reliability and efficiency.
During the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the energy crisis as a consequence of the Russian invasion in
Ukraine, our European footprint provided us with the necessary degree of flexibility to continue our
production at the required level and serve our customers’ needs.

We are convinced that the continuous strategic development of our asset base remains key to our continued
success as a leading, cost efficient tissue producer in Europe. To further strengthen our market position and
competitiveness, we implemented a number of strategic capital expenditure projects between 2020 and 2023,
notwithstanding the special challenges we faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian
invasion of Ukraine. In that period, we invested a total of €316 million into our business. This includes an
investment of €122 million in two new, highly efficient paper machines at our production sites in Piechowice,
Poland and Bridgend, UK. We also successfully completed a pan-European investment project which included
11 new converting lines for our plants in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK. Additionally,
we have taken strategic measures to allow a fast shift to different energy sources such as liquified natural gas
and oil in the event of a gas shortage. As part of our project “Bluetec”, we have developed alternative energy
sources for the paper drying process in paper machines, such as electricity, steam or thermal oil instead of
direct gas firing, and have installed 2.9MW of solar capacity on the roofs of our facilities at our production
sites in Swalmen, the Netherlands, and Salanetti, Italy, with further installations planned at other production
sites, including an extension of the existing solar capacity in Salanetti, Italy.


-----

With our latest acquisition of a stock preparation unit (used for the preparation of de-inked pulp from
recovered paper) located in close proximity to our tissue paper manufacturing site in Kriebstein, Germany,
which we acquired from the insolvent Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH in June 2023, we
believe we have generated synergies for our manufacturing sites in Kriebstein and Leuna, Germany and
Piechowice, Poland with regard to efficiency and cost savings, as well as increased flexibility for the Group.
With the addition of the former Kübler & Niethammer stock preparation unit to our de-inked pulp capacities,
we have increased our stock preparation capacity by 43,500 tons p.a. and thereby widely balanced our
integrated internal production of de-inked pulp with our actual demand for recycled tissue. This gives us the
opportunity to further focus our specialized de-inked pulp mill in Château-Thierry on differentiated fiber
production from circular economy and offer alternative and more sustainable fibers either to third parties or
to further grow our sustainable product portfolio. This includes a broader co-operation approach, e.g., the
most recent joint venture for production of biogas from recycled paper scrap in Château-Thierry as a first
step.

**_Strong and Proven Financial Track Record, providing Stability even in very Challenging Market Environments_**

Over the last years, we have significantly strengthened our financial resilience. In particular, we have
(i) substantially diversified our customer base and expanded our product portfolio, (ii) reduced or exited
unprofitable business lines (e.g. the crepe business), customer relationships and markets, (iii) expanded our
geographic footprint in new and/or attractive target markets, (iv) significantly reduced our reliance on fresh
fiber as our main raw material (e.g. by continuing to develop our hybrid products) and focused on innovations
around using more recycled- or alternative fiber tissue products (such as fibers from OCC and fibers made
from miscanthus grass) and (v) continued to significantly invest in further optimizing and expanding our
asset base, including targeted expansion investments and sustainable capacity management measures intended
to drive further cost reductions, portfolio optimization and efficiency improvements and working capital
reductions such as our 2 new, highly efficient paper machines and our 11 new converting lines. In addition to
these measures, we have successfully carried on our continuous improvement process, a systematic and
ongoing program to continuously improve our profitability and cash position. We have also continued to
refine our adaptive and balanced risk management strategy, which, among other things, relies on adaptive
and rolling hedging measures designed to limit our exposure to short- to mid-term fluctuations in the price of
pulp, exchange rates and energy prices, our ability to preserve cash in the mid-term through the adaptation of
the amount of our capital expenditures and a stable financing structure.

The measures taken have allowed us to successfully navigate the significant economic challenges imposed on
us and our industry between 2020 to 2022, including labor shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, supply
chain disruptions resulting in record high price levels for pulp in Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine as
well as the resulting energy crisis with energy prices increasing as high as 15x higher than at the beginning of
2020. Despite these multiple market-driven crises within a short time period, we believe our performance
during such challenging times has helped us to further strengthen our long-standing reputation as a reliable,
innovative and transparent partner with enduring, strong and trusted relationships with our customers,
allowing us to become even more resilient. We successfully shortened contract cycles with our customers and
succeeded in implementing required price increases without losing business or trust. In addition, we
implemented further measures to reduce volatility, such as a rolling 18 months forecasting on a monthly basis
which is harmonized to the pricing strategy and broader sourcing of energy and materials. We also introduced
the function of a business resilience manager to proactively manage volatility by collaborating crossfunctionally across our Group. As a result, we believe we can adapt more quickly and more proactively to
changing price levels and seasonality (i.e. energy pricing during summer vs. winter periods). For additional
measures we plan to adopt as part of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 to guide our business within
potential future volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (“VUCA”) market environments, see also “—Our
_Strategy—Focus on Strong Profitability and Financial Resilience” and “—Our Strategy—Continuous Striving_
_for Efficiency through Cost and Technology Leadership”._

We believe that due to the positive impact of the various measures and developments described above, we have
emerged from the market-driven challenges of this multi-crisis period significantly stronger than before. While
the Russian invasion of Ukraine created very significant challenges for our business, both our sales and
EBITDA increased significantly from €1,205.9 million and €93.1 million, respectively, in 2021, to
€1,636.4 million and €145.6 million, respectively, in 2022. In the twelve-month period ended September 30,
2023, we reported sales and EBITDA of €1,865.1 million and €318.2 million, respectively. Our EBITDA
margin (i.e., EBITDA as a percentage of our total operating performance for the period) amounted to 17.0%
in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, compared to 8.6% in the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2022 and 7.7% in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, reflecting our ability to


-----

pass-through cost increases to our customers with continued momentum. In addition, we had a free cash flow
(adjusted by ABS Program) of €200 million in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, while our
Net Debt was reduced to €503 million with a corresponding Net Debt Ratio of 1.6x as of September 30, 2023.

**_Experienced Management and Committed Family Shareholders_**

Our company was founded in 1948 by Paul Krengel, and even today, our Group continues to be 100% owned
by members of the Krengel family. We believe that the strong personal and financial commitment from our
family shareholders ensures prudent investment strategies, a focus on stability and long-term value generation.
Martin Krengel, in particular, has overseen the growth of the business through his role as our Chief Executive
Officer and has been involved in the business since 1985.

The strong personal and financial commitment of our family shareholders is augmented by a strong and
highly-experienced management team with extensive industry experience. In response to the increasing size
and complexity of the Group as well as the industry we are operating in, we have successfully structured our
organization in a matrix with clear business unit and functional responsibilities and have expanded both the
size of our Management Board and our highly experienced senior management team in recent years. Our
Chief Executive Officer Martin Krengel and our long-term Chief Financial Officer Ralph Dihlmann, who
has been with the Group since 2014, have been joined by Andreas Krengel as member of our management
board in 2021. With a degree in business economics and previously serving as our Chief Strategy Officer,
Andreas Krengel is now responsible as Chief Executive Officer for both our Professional business unit and
our recently set up new business unit “New Business Areas”. Andreas Krengel’s management role in our
Professional business unit, his appointment to our Management Board and his management positions in our
family shareholders’ holding entities serve the goal of securing our future as a successful family-owned
business into the next generation.

Also in 2021, the Management Board was joined by Harm Bergmann-Kramer. Having graduated in
engineering, Harm Bergmann-Kramer has held various international management positions across the paper
industry for 19 years prior to taking over responsibility as our Chief Operating Officer. The latest addition to
our Management Board has been Menno Oosterhoff who joined us in 2022. With a degree in business
administration, Menno Oosterhoff has 24 years of extensive sales experience across the international
consumer goods industry and assumed the role as Chief Executive Officer for our Consumer business unit.

**OUR STRATEGY**

We want to be recognized by our customers as the partner of choice for hygiene paper in Europe and become
the market leader in sustainability with a strong culture and a strong focus on performance in everything we
do. To achieve this goal, we developed our “Perform & Transform Strategy 2026”, which builds on the original
“Perform & Transform” strategy we developed for the period from 2020 until 2023.

The key elements of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026, as further described below, are (i) a focus on
strong profitability and financial resilience, (ii) a continuous striving for efficiency, through cost and
technology leadership, (iii) the goal to become the partner of choice for our customers for hygiene paper by
building on our reputation as a strong and reliable supplier and by differentiating ourselves as a “concept
supplier”, (iv) a strong commitment to sustainability, as well as (v) our efforts to promote employee
engagement and performance through the establishment of a “performance with care” culture across our
organization and by becoming the “best place to work” for our employees.

**_Focus on Strong Profitability and Financial Resilience_**

A key element of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 is our goal to achieve a high degree of financial
resilience and strategic flexibility through (i) improvements to our ability to monitor, manage and improve
our margins, (ii) development of digital management tools supporting fast and proactive analytics, resilience
management and increased adaptivity of our supply chain, and (iii) an increased focus on optimizing how we
fund our operations. In particular, we have been putting a higher focus on proactive resilience management
and on digitizing and consistently cascading our decision-making processes to enable us to actively shape and
guide our business within VUCA market environments. This includes investments in forward-looking
management and forecasting tools, adaptive pricing and hedging measures as well as adaptive supply chain
measures. To strengthen our resilience in VUCA environments, we are also investing into diversifying and
broadening our production, supply chain and raw materials footprint. We have taken various measures
intended to strengthen our resilience and stabilize our gross margins at adequate levels, including the
development and introduction of product innovations (see also “—Strong Commitment to Sustainability”
below), efforts to differentiate and position ourselves as a “concept supplier” (see also “—Partner of Choice


-----

_for our Customers” below), the continuous development and improvement of our balanced risk management_
strategy and the introduction of more sophisticated contract and pricing structures that are better suited to
VUCA environments. On a case-by-case basis, this may include price balancing mechanisms and adaptive/
index pricing in longer-term agreements or the conclusion of shorter term, fixed price contracts. We have
introduced cash conversion as a key performance indicator to increase the awareness among our various
stakeholders of our cash generation capabilities, and we are also being more deliberate and proactive in
managing our inventories, treating working capital as an investment and inventory management as part of
our overall resilience management.

In all our decision-making, we recognize that a stable finance structure is critical to our long-term success.
This does not only include the ability to generate free cash flows sufficient to cover our regular maintenance
capital expenditures and other ongoing expenses, but also means that we must be able to further make
significant, controlled and “through-the-cycle” investments into long-term improvements of our regional,
technical and sustainability footprint. To ensure our continued ability to weather and/or adapt to future
VUCA environments (such as rapid and/or sustained increases in pulp, recycled paper or energy prices), we
plan to further enhance our proactive performance management, including requirements on more sustainable
margins based on expected input cost and additional services to ensure resilience, and to further enhance our
ability to preserve cash in the mid-term by adapting our discretionary capital expenditures.

Our focus on strong profitability will also cover measures related to our strategic portfolio management and
further efficiency improvements. We will continue to pursue our long-term strategy of gradually expanding
our customer base as well as our product portfolio and regional footprint as part of a continuous and
deliberate portfolio management process. Active portfolio management as (i) a continuous improvement
process, (ii) supplemented by customer-oriented innovations, (iii) supported by bolt-on acquisitions and
(iv) through regional organic growth has allowed us to significantly expand our business and to reduce our
dependence on any particular individual customers, products or regions, all while continuously working on
further efficiency improvements.

**_Continuous Striving for Efficiency through Cost and Technology Leadership_**

As our product offering mainly consists of commodity-like products, with market participants traditionally
focused primarily on price, a continuous focus on working efficiently and controlling costs (i.e. the ability to
continue to find ways to “do more with less”) has always been crucial to our ability to remain competitive and
to continue to operate in our industry. As part of the original Perform & Transform strategy we developed for
the strategic period from 2020 until 2023, we already set ourselves the goal to become the most efficient
company in the European tissue industry and initiated several related, group-wide initiatives. These include
initiatives aimed at achieving savings and efficiency improvements in the areas of fiber, energy and logistics.
With our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026, we continue to emphasize our goal to become the most efficient
and competitive company in our industry, through both cost and technology leadership, building on our
investments in our modern asset base over the last decade.

Building on a structure that we believe is already lean to begin with, we plan to continuously strive to achieve
cost leadership though additional efficiency improvements as part of our long-standing continuous
improvement program. As part of this program, we are executing numerous optimization initiatives in
different areas such as production, supply chain, sales, procurement and shared services. We further plan to
continue our other efficiency programs (such as our manufacturing excellence (“ManEx”) program) and
strategic operational programs (such as our Bluetec program). The aim of our long-standing ManEx program,
for example, is to continuously and sustainably improve our knowledge, our structures and our processes
within our organization by using benchmarking and by identifying and adopting best practices. We believe
there is still significant potential for us to “do more” with our existing asset base (including a potential
significant increase in the notional production capacity of our existing assets) through further standardization,
optimization and simplification of our production and manufacturing processes and a further simplification
of our product groups. With our “Bluetec”program, we aim to diversify our energy mix by increasing our use
of renewable energy (such as solar power, biomass and wind power) and to further reduce our reliance on
conventional sources of energy, in particular gas, thereby “future proofing” our business. For example, we
have already installed 2.9MW of solar capacity on the roofs of our facilities at our production sites in Salanetti,
Italy and Swalmen, the Netherlands, with plans to install additional solar capacity on the roofs of our facilities
at our production sites in Leuna, Müschede, Giershagen and Salanetti. However, in this regard, we also expect
to benefit from proposed future investments outside the Group by our Parent in complementary business
areas such as renewable energy, alternative fibers and circular economy business models, which we expect will
allow us to preserve capital and focus our own capital expenditures, efforts and other resources on further


-----

expanding and improving our asset base that is more directly related to our core tissue business. See also
“—Strong Commitment to Sustainability” and “Sustainability” below.

The second element of our drive for efficiency and competitiveness is technology leadership. This is because
we view technology leadership as a crucial enabler of efficiency-based cost leadership. We therefore not only
continuously strive to further optimize the capacity and the utilization of our paper machines and converting
lines as part of our ManEx program and other operational efficiency programs, but we also plan to continue
to improve and upgrade our asset base. In some cases, this may include replacing less efficient older equipment
with more efficient modern equipment, but we also have a dedicated program aimed at identifying and
implementing technology improvement projects (drawing either on our own internal resources and technical
expertise or working in tandem with external partners) in which we are either a first adopter of a particular
industry in our industry or even the inventor of new technology.

To achieve the full benefits of all these projects and initiatives, we believe it is crucial that we can deliver them
on time, on budget and on target, and we have therefore been putting a very strong emphasis on excellence in
project management and project execution and invested in enhanced project management and project
execution capabilities.

**_Partner of Choice for Our Customers_**

A further key element of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 is our goal to become the partner of choice
for our customers for hygiene paper by building on our reputation as a strong and reliable supplier and by
differentiating ourselves as a “concept supplier”. With competition in our markets traditionally focused
primarily on price, we have always viewed our ability to deliver our products at the right cost and with the
right level of service, quality and reliability as a basic, yet crucial requirement to be able to remain competitive
in our industry. We therefore strive to maintain and further strengthen our long-standing reputation as a
reliable, innovative and transparent partner with enduring, strong and trusted relationships with our
customers. In many cases, we are already fully embedded in the supply chains of our customers. We believe
our performance and reliability throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and periods marked by extreme energy
price peaks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which at times forced certain other market participants
to reduce or suspend product deliveries, has further strengthened our reputation. We also believe that the
COVID-19 pandemic and recent market volatility have led to an important shift in how we are perceived,
especially by our larger customers, i.e. not just as a (theoretically replaceable) supplier of commodity-like
products, but as a critical supply chain partner. Furthermore, we believe we are now the only remaining
company with a clear focus on the private label tissue market and with the scale, capabilities and pan-European
footprint necessary to be able to supply our larger customers across multiple markets.

Building on this reputation and market position, we have invested significant time, effort and other resources
in recent years to move beyond the status of a mere supplier of tissue products. Specifically, one of our key
strategic goals for 2026 is to generate more than 50% of our sales, by volume, from costumers for which we act
as a “concept supplier”. As a “concept supplier”, we offer the relevant customers cross-functional
collaboration and to closely align our strategic plans with their strategic priorities, in particular in relation to
the introduction and development of new sustainable and/or innovative products, customer brands and
value-added services. In the first nine months of 2023, we generated approximately 15% of our sales, by
volume, from costumers for which we act as a “concept supplier”, and we believe that that the added value we
are providing as a “concept supplier” allows us and the relevant customers to generate both higher and more
stable margins in relation to such sales. We can offer the relevant customers unique and tailored solutions and,
in some cases have created and implemented joint business plans with individual customers. The relevant
customers can, but do not have to, opt into a range of additional, value-added services, including support
with product and packaging innovations, robust supply chain management and optimization, joint
forecasting, combined truck loading, category management, sustainability and circular solutions and tailored
price balancing mechanisms and adaptive/index pricing in longer-term agreements. For example, we can offer
customers of our Professional business unit that want to be able to offer their customers sustainable tissue
solutions our own range of sustainable brands as well as product innovations, and we collaborate with our
customers on circular solutions such as hand towel return services. At the same time, there is an increasing
recognition among many of our customers that the only way they can meet their self-imposed sustainability
goals is to collaborate with more sophisticated suppliers that can deliver the required improvements (e.g. with
regard to reduced CO2 footprints and/or increased recycling contents of particular products) in a way that is
“audit proof” and satisfies relevant third party verifiers. We have invested significantly in the relevant
value-adding capabilities, capabilities that many of our smaller competitors, in particular, and/or competitors
that are mere “converters” with no tissue paper production of their own simply lack. See also “—Strong
_Commitment to Sustainability” and “Sustainability” below._


-----

To be the partner of choice for our customers, we may further make additional investments to expand and
strengthen our regional footprint, either in the form of investment into new or expanded production facilities
or opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions. Following the consolidation amongst European retail groups, it has
become even more important that we can supply our customers across their respective markets. We want to be
able to offer our customers bespoke concepts for their own brands in all markets in which they operate,
including bespoke specifications, qualities and price mechanisms. We therefore continue to carefully assess
potential bolt-on acquisitions from time to time, not only to be able to match the pan-European footprints of
our customers, but also to potentially acquire attractive customer bases, to further broaden our portfolio
and/or to leverage our asset base.

**_Strong Commitment to Sustainability_**

We believe we are already an innovation leader with our long-standing focus on sustainable products and
production. See also “Our Strengths—Innovation Leader with a Long-standing Focus on Sustainable Products
_and Production”above and “Sustainability”below. Our strong commitment to sustainability, our aspiration to_
act sustainably in everything we do and our goal to be the most sustainable tissue producer are therefore
further key elements of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026.

We believe that sustainability is part of our DNA and that our authentic and genuine approach to
sustainability, based on decades of innovation leadership, in particular with regard to recycled and hybrid
tissue products, will serve us well as a key differentiator from many of our competitors. In order to build on
this key strength, we developed our “4+1 Strategy”which defines our sustainability goals in four distinct areas
into which we have divided our sustainability efforts: (i) future fibers, (ii) sustainable production,
(iii) sustainable products and (iv) portfolio extension through innovation. The guiding principle for all of
these goals and for how we want to operate as a business is a strong value foundation (i.e. the “+1”in our “4+1
Strategy”) that encourages responsible conduct as an employer, social commitment, compliance and product
safety.

_Future fibers._ We have long been convinced that recycled paper is the most sensible raw material, from a
sustainability perspective, for tissue products because (i) recycled tissue products have a significantly lower
ecological footprint than comparable pure pulp tissue products, and (ii) the fiber used in the production of
tissue products, in most cases, is irretrievably lost after the use of the product. At the same time, our
technologically advanced production capabilities allow us to produce recycled and hybrid tissue products of a
quality and brightness that is comparable to that of tissue products produced with virgin pulp. However, in
part due to digitalization and a change in working patters, high-quality recovered paper grades, such as office
paper, are becoming increasingly scarce in the market. We are therefore investing significantly in new
technologies, new processes and innovative products that use lower grades of recovered paper, such as OCC.
In addition, we have been investing into alternative virgin fibers (i.e. alternatives to wood-based virgin fibers)
for tissue such as fibers from miscanthus grass cultivated in Europe on fallow land. These alternative types of
fibers not only have significantly improved ecological footprints compared to pulp, but they also help us
diversify our fiber mix. Our ultimate goal is to create a fiber portfolio which addresses a broad range of
sustainability requirements, such as CO2 reduction, biodiversity, land use, waste avoidance and reduced
transportation requirements. In 2022, for example, we launched two new fiber innovations: (i) Black Satino
GreenGrow, a miscanthus-based tissue paper, and (ii) our Satino PureSoft Sortiment, based on OCC-based
tissue paper. According to the German Federal Environmental Agency, the OCC-based tissue paper
constitutes the biggest innovation in the paper segment in the last decade.

_Sustainable production and operational efficiency._ With regard to operational efficiency, we plan to
significantly reduce our CO2 and water footprint and to follow a zero-waste approach, with the goal to become
CO2 neutral by 2040. We strive to reach CO2 neutrality with a balanced mix of investments into our own
sustainable energy production, such as solar, wind and biogas, as well as through relevant power purchase
agreements with third parties, which may include power purchase agreement with our Parent or other affiliates
as described below. Our climate targets are flanked by continuous efficiency improvements and the increasing
use of renewable energy. See also “—Continuous Striving for Efficiency through Cost and Technology
_Leadership” above._

_Sustainable hygiene paper portfolio._ Regarding our goal to offer the most sustainable hygiene paper portfolio,
we have evaluated our hygiene paper portfolio based different sustainability criteria. We plan to use the results
of this evaluation to identify options for the sustainable further development of our portfolio, and to
transparently communicate with customers on how to make their product range more environmentally
friendly. These efforts also include innovative packaging solutions. Among other things, we have set ourselves


-----

a target to use recycled material for 60% of our packaging material by 2025 and save 8,000 tons of primary
plastics in our packaging every year.

_Portfolio extension through innovation._ We are expanding our existing product portfolio with the goal of
leadership in sustainable hygiene solutions in Europe. We believe that only ecologically and socially sustainable
innovations and business models allow for robust economic profitability in the long-term. We are therefore
committed to sustainability in the expansion of our product portfolio and in the area of research and
development. In 2022, we introduced a mandatory sustainability assessment for all our investments. This
assessment takes into account the environmental and social added value for society and for our company, and
includes an analysis of potential environmental, social and governance risks.

To meet our sustainability goals, including environmental protection, fiber diversification, increased
competitiveness, regulatory compliance, and to take advantage of sustainable growth opportunities, we further
plan to develop an investment roadmap to identify how we can “future proof” our business, for example, by
(i) increasing our use of renewable energy and reducing our reliance on conventional sources of energy, in
particular gas, (ii) improving and securing our access to “future fibers” and/or (iii) by further integrating
circular economy aspects into our production processes and product life cycles. See also “—Continuous
_Striving for Efficiency through Cost and Technology Leadership” above. In this regard, we expect to benefit_
from proposed future investments outside the Group by our Parent in complementary business areas such as
renewable energy, alternative fibers and circular economy business models. As these activities and business
areas mostly fall outside our core expertise as a tissue producer and involve different skill sets, expertise,
funding models and investment horizons, developing and/or integrating them into our organization would
potentially create significant challenges and might therefore distract us from our core business. We may
therefore conclude that it is preferable for all our stakeholders that any potential significant future investments
in those areas to be make outside the Group by our Parent or other affiliates. This approach would allow us to
potentially gain contractual exposure (e.g. via power purchase agreements) and preferential access (albeit only
through related party agreements on an arm’s length basis) to these important complementary businesses
areas, while allowing us to preserve capital and focus our own capital expenditures, efforts and other resources
on further expanding and improving our asset base that is more directly related to our core tissue business. As
part of such an approach, we may conclude that it is in the best interest of the Group to sell (on arm’s length
terms) WEPA Greenfield S.A.S. and its dry de-inked pulp production site in Château-Thierry, France to our
Parent. Acquired in March 2019 in an opportunistic transaction, our de-inked pulp production in ChâteauThierry is not integrated into any of our tissue paper production sites and our only business that relies on
third party sales of semi-finished products. A sale to our Parent or another affiliate might therefore allow us to
free up capital to reinvest into our core business, while preserving preferential access to the de-inked pulp
produced at the site.

**_Establish our Performance with Care Culture and Offering the Best Place to Work_**

The final element of our Perform & Transform Strategy 2026 consists of our efforts to promote employee
engagement and performance through the establishment of a “performance with care” culture across our
organization and by becoming the “best place to work”for our employees. We believe that we can only achieve
our other strategic goals if our employees across our organization work focused and with passion and take
ownership of their decisions and actions. As a family-owned company, we are highly committed to enable and
challenge our people with care. While the “performance” element remains key to our overall success and our
strategic goals, we also believe that caring for our employees is crucial to our continued success. We want to
facilitate high operating performance while fostering a care culture, including through the use of professional
steering and management tools. We believe that the tools we have implemented will help our employees to
prioritize, help us to build teams based on the strength of individuals and support life-long learning. Through
our WEPA Academy we aim to provide a platform that ensures that each employee gets the opportunity to
gain the skills necessary to master his/her role and to deliver on his/her goals.

The success of our business depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified management
personnel and skilled workers in the long term. We compete with a large number of other companies when
recruiting qualified employees. In all Western European markets in which we operate, there is an increasing
shortage of qualified personnel, especially workers with technical or engineering skills. As part of the “Best
Place to Work” element of our strategy, we aim to tackle these challenges by creating an attractive working
environment. This leveraging the potential benefits of digitalization in supporting our employees in their
personal learning and growth. In particular, we aim to offer interesting and purposeful work to our employees,
build learning and development into our daily work routines and to make our employees engage and identify
with our Group’s mission. We believe that this approach is yielding tangible benefits for our business. For
example, encouraging and enabling our employees to “upskill”, work in different positions and/or learn to


-----

operate different equipment may not only make work more interesting and improve job satisfaction, but may
give us more flexibility to deploy those employees in different areas of our organization in response to changes
in our operations, to cover absences by other employees or for other reasons. By capitalizing on the potential
benefits of digitalization, we want to create a workplace that provides our employees with a level of flexibility
to choose where and how they do their work. We also want for our employees to be supported, not replaced,
by digitalization and developments in the area of artificial intelligence.

**HISTORY**

We were founded in 1948 by Paul Krengel as a wholesaler of wrapping, gift wrapping and cupboard lining
paper. Five years later, we expanded our product range by installing our first automatic converting machine
for the production of hygiene paper products, such as toilet paper. In 1958, we started our own tissue paper
production with our first paper machine, and since then, we have continuously invested in the development of
our production sites. By the end of the 1980s, we were increasingly focusing on recovered paper and had
become one of the leading producers of recycled tissue products.

In 1990, shortly after German reunification, we commenced operations in the former East Germany, initially
as a 50/50 joint venture until we bought out our joint venture partner in 2001. In 2004, we installed one of the
then-fastest state-of-the-art kitchen towel converting lines in Europe at our production site in Giershagen. In
2006, we continued to grow by acquiring a tissue paper production and converting site in Mainz, Germany,
from Kimberly Clark and the Polish tissue producer Fabryka Papieru Piechowice SA with a production site in
Piechowice, Poland.

In 2009, we acquired the majority of the assets of the former Kartogroup, an Italian tissue company. By
adding production sites in Italy, France and Germany, the acquisition allowed us to create a production
network across Europe that more closely matched the geographic footprint of our key customers and to
improve our supply chain and logistics. Further, our expanded geographic footprint strengthened our sales
position and the loyalty of our fast-growing European customers. In addition to entering the Italian market,
we also gained new customers, particularly in the BeNeLux region, France and Eastern Europe, expanded
into napkin products and increased our purchasing power.

In 2014, we acquired the co-generation power plant located adjacent to our site in Giershagen, Germany,
which provides 36% of our electric power and 100% of our steam requirements in 2018 for such site by using
the residual materials from our recycling processes in Arnsberg and Giershagen as a source of thermal energy.
In addition, we acquired a 50% stake in Northwood & Wepa, a 50:50 joint venture originally established in
2013 by members of the Krengel family (the owners of the WEPA Group) and members of the Fecher family
(the owners of Northwood Paper) in the United Kingdom. At the production site in Bridgend, United
Kingdom private label toilet paper and kitchen towels are produced for the UK and Irish markets.

In 2015, we acquired the fully-integrated former Lucart plant in Troyes, France, which allowed us to
significantly strengthen our market position in the French private label market, to further optimize logistics
and freight costs and to further increase our production flexibility by significantly increasing our paper
production and converting capacity in France. The same year, we also successfully commenced operations of
new paper machines in Lille, France and Giershagen, Germany which further strengthened our
competitiveness as the third largest producer in the European tissue product market.

In 2017, we acquired the Dutch AfH specialist and family business Van Houtum (now: Wepa Nederland B.V.)
in Swalmen, the Netherlands. Van Houtum had established a leading position with the former Satino Black
brand in the market for sustainable product solutions. Through the takeover we significantly increased our
sales volumes in the Professional business, both with the brands Satino by WEPA and BlackSatino as well as
with customer-specific solutions under commercial brands.

In 2018, we acquired the remaining 50% stake in our former joint venture Northwood & Wepa (now Wepa
UK Ltd). The entity was subsequently renamed Wepa UK Ltd. By taking over the joint venture, we
significantly expanded our position in the UK market which we believe has an above the average growth
potential.

In 2019, we took over the de-inked pulp production site in Château-Thierry, France. The production site,
which was operated under the name “Greenfield” was sold as part of an insolvency procedure of the French
Arjowiggins Group. The plant is solely focused on the production of de-inked pulp from recovered paper.
Due to its state-of-the art technology, it enables us to produce significantly drier de-inked pulp compared to
the de-inked pulp produced at our other facilities, resulting in significantly better transportation and storage
characteristics of the produced de-inked pulp. With the increased capacity and competence in the processing


-----

of recovered paper we also strengthened our position as a market leader in the field of recycled papers, while
at the same time helping us to secure our long-term supply with de-inked pulp.

In 2020, we integrated the former Victor Güthoff business into our Group. The business is now conducted
under the name “WEPA Category Solutions” and allowed us, among others, to both acquire additional sales
volumes with existing customers of our Consumer business unit and to diversify our business into related
areas, such as products in the area of hygiene wipes, sustainable packaging and various products in the
cleaning, foil and packaging sector.

In 2021, we installed a new paper machine at our site in Piechowice, Poland, increasing the site’s annual paper
production capacity by 36,000 tons to 65,000 tons.

In 2022, we successfully commenced operations of a new paper machine at our site in Bridgend, UK, thereby
more than doubling our tissue production capacity in the UK to 110,000 tons. In the same year, we also
introduced two additional new raw material innovations as part of our sustainability strategy: recycled paper
made from OCC and fibers made from miscanthus grass, which offers a significantly improved ecological
footprint compared to pulp.

In June 2023, we acquired a stock preparation unit (used for the preparation of de-inked pulp from recovered
paper) located in close proximity to our tissue paper manufacturing site in Kriebstein, Germany from the
insolvent Kübler & Niethammer Papierfabrik Kriebstein GmbH. By integrating the facility into our
production site, we believe we have generated synergies for our production sites in Kriebstein and Leuna,
Germany, and Piechowice, Poland, with regard to efficiency and costs savings as well as increased flexibility
for our Group.

In January 2024, we acquired Star Tissue UK Ltd. (now: Wepa Professional UK Ltd.), a tissue paper
converting and distribution company located in Blackburn, United Kingdom. With a tissue paper converting
capacity of 27,000 tons p.a. and 136 employees, the acquisition serves to strengthen our Professional business
in the United Kingdom. We also believe that the acquisition of Star Tissue UK Ltd. will allow us to generate
synergies with our paper production sites. For further details on the UK Acquisition, see “Summary—Recent
_Developments”._

**CONSUMER BUSINESS UNIT**

**Overview**

Our Consumer business unit generated €1,486.9 million in sales from finished products in the twelve-month
period ended September 30, 2023, which represented 85.8% of our total sales from finished products in such
period. It focuses on the production and distribution of tissue products for the German and wider European
retail sector, primarily branded under private labels of our customers. Our customers include major national
and multi-national retail and drugstore chains. Although we also market products under a number of our
own consumer brands such as Mach m!t…, Comprami, Scala and Perla, our strategy has been to focus on the
so-called “private label” business, i.e. tissue products that are being marketed and sold by our customers
through their retail stores under their own retail brands.

Private label products accounted for 96.6% of total sales by our Consumer business unit in 2022, while branded
products accounted for 3.4%. Private label products represent by far the largest share of the overall tissue
market in most of the markets in which we operate. While the market share of private label tissue products has
stabilized at high levels in some markets, the overall market share of private label tissue products, by volume
share, relative to branded products, has increased in Western Europe from 64.4% in 2015 to 71.5% in 2022,
according to RISI. In 2022, for example, private labels accounted for an estimated 78.2%, 72.8% and 67.7% of
the overall tissue market by volume in Germany, France and UK, respectively, according to RISI. With the
exception of the tissue markets in Italy, Norway and Finland, branded products accounted for less than 40%
of the tissue market in Western Europe by volume share, according to RISI. We believe our focus on the
private label market allows us to benefit from the growth potential in this market segment as well as from
economic slowdowns when there is an increasing trend for consumers to buy less expensive private label tissue
products. Although private label products are often positioned as low cost alternatives to regional, national or
international brands, they are typically of comparable quality and several private labels have been positioned
as “premium” brands, putting further pressure on the market for branded tissue products.

**Products**

We sell a broad range of tissue paper products in our Consumer business unit, with a focus on toilet paper,
kitchen towels, handkerchiefs, facial tissues and napkins. Our production and converting facilities allow us to


-----

produce tissue paper products to a broad range of specifications. Our product range includes tissue products
with varying layers, additives (e.g. chamomile for toilet paper and balsam for handkerchiefs), colors,
decorations, sizes, embossments and packaging sizes. For consumers with a focus on sustainability, we have
successfully developed our WEPA hybrid tissue products made from both recycled fiber and fresh fiber, and
our tissue products made from recycled OCC. Both product lines are offered to our retail customers for
distribution under their own retail labels and improve the environmental footprint of hygiene paper products
significantly compared to pure fresh fiber products.

In addition to private labels, our own consumer brands include Mach m!t…, Comprami, Perla and Scala. In
our markets in Southern Europe, we have a significant presence with our Perla and Scala brands, which we
acquired as part of the Kartogroup in 2009. Perla, Scala and Comprami are well-known brands in the Italian
tissue market, each with a broad assortment of products intended to meet the needs of private consumers.

**Customers**

We have established a strong and longstanding customer base, with some of our key customer relationships
dating back more than 40 years and the relationships with many of our top ten customers (by volume) in 2022
existing for more than 20 years. We have grown with our large German customers as they have expanded
across Europe and have also successfully entered into new relationships with key customers outside of
Germany. Today we supply approximately 100 customers in our Consumer business unit, including leading
retailers such as Aldi, dm, Edeka, Lidl, Müller, Netto and REWE in Germany, Auchan, Carrefour,
Intermarché and Leclerc in France, Coop, Esselunga and Eurospin in Italy, Biedronka in Poland, Aldi, Coop
and Tesco in the UK and Action, Colruyt and Superunie in the BeNeLux region. In addition, we supply
IKEA worldwide with napkins. Our five largest customers and our ten largest customers accounted for 37%
and 53%, respectively, of our total sales in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

In line with market practice, more than 70% of our total sales volumes are governed by framework agreements
with our retail customers, allowing our customers to place orders “on demand”. The framework agreements
generally do not provide for automatic price adjustments. Instead, the sales prices under these agreements are
usually fixed for the duration of the agreement, with the term of such agreements recently tending to periods
of three to six months given the current market volatility in terms of pricing for our input factors. Although
these agreements generally do not contain minimum purchase obligations, demand levels are typically stable
and we are in regular contact with our customers to ensure we have reasonable visibility over sales volumes for
the respective upcoming six to twelve months.

As part of our “concept supplier”approach, we seek to increase the number of longer-term supply agreements
with adaptive pricing mechanisms in exchange for offering the relevant customers cross-functional
collaboration and to closely align our strategic plans with their strategic priorities, in particular in relation to
the introduction and development of new sustainable and/or innovative products, customer brands and
value-added services, as further described under “—Our Strategy—Partner of Choice for Our Customers”. In
the first nine months of 2023, we generated approximately 15% of our sales, by volume, from customers for
whom we act as a “concept supplier”, and we believe that the added value we are providing as a “concept
supplier”allows us to generate both higher and more stable margins from such sales. We can offer the relevant
customers unique and tailored solutions and, in some cases, have created and implemented joint business
plans with individual customers. The relevant customers can, but do not have to, opt into a range of additional,
value-added services, including support with product and packaging innovations, robust supply chain
management and optimization, joint forecasting, combined truck loading, category management,
sustainability and circular solutions and tailored price balancing mechanisms and adaptive/index pricing in
longer-term agreements. At the same time, there is an increasing recognition among many of our customers
that the only way they can meet their self-imposed sustainability goals is to collaborate with more sophisticated
suppliers that can deliver the required improvements (e.g. with regard to reduced CO2 footprints and/or
increased recycling contents of particular products) in a way that is “audit proof” and satisfies relevant third
party verifiers. We have invested significantly in the relevant value-adding capabilities, capabilities that many
of our smaller competitors, in particular, and/or competitors that are mere “converters” with no tissue paper
production of their own, simply lack.

**PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS UNIT**

**Overview**

Our Professional business unit generated €246.0 million in sales or 14.2% of our total sales from finished
products in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023. We offer a broad range of tissue paper
products both under our brands Satino by WEPA and BlackSatino and also under our customers’own brands,


-----

including paper towels, toilet paper, industrial rolls as well as dispenser systems for use in washrooms and for
cleaning by large commercial and institutional customers, such as government agencies, hotels, restaurants,
private enterprises, hospitals, airports and other public washroom providers. Geographically, our Professional
business unit has a regional focus within Central Europe and Poland.

In order to emphasize the importance of professional buyers and to better meet the needs of our customers,
we established a dedicated sales unit for our Professional business unit. Our dedicated sales and marketing
team for the Professional business unit consists of 70 people who centrally direct the sales, marketing and
customer service activities from our headquarters in Arnsberg as well as on-site in the respective sales regions.
In addition, we have dedicated production facilities for Professional specialty products at our production sites
in Arnsberg, Germany, Swalmen, the Netherlands and Piechowice, Poland, but we also produce certain
products at other production sites for Professional customers. Our newly acquired production site in
Blackburn, United Kingdom, is also focused on the converting of tissue paper for our Professional business
unit.

**Products**

Our product range in the Professional business unit includes a wide tissue paper range mainly for public
washroom applications, such as paper towels and toilet paper, as well as paper rolls for cleaning by large
commercial and institutional customers. These products are primarily being marketed under the Satino brand
and supported by a proprietary range of dispenser systems, in addition to private label offerings for large
wholesalers. With the product lines Satino by WEPA and BlackSatino, we also have product lines which stand
for sustainable state-of-the-art washroom hygiene solutions, with a focus on premium quality, contemporary
design and sustainability. We also plan to launch a new dispenser line in 2024. Paper towels, toilet paper and
industrial rolls are, by far, the most important product groups within our Professional business unit,
accounting in aggregate for 89% of its sales in 2022.

**Customers**

The products offered by our Professional business unit are mainly distributed via specialized wholesalers for
cleaning products (such as GVS eG and igefa), office supply companies and cash & carry wholesalers. In some
cases, we also sell our products directly to large commercial and institutional customers. In total, we supply
approximately 360 customers in our Professional business unit. Ultimate buyers of our products are
commercial and institutional customers and include government agencies, hotels, restaurants, private
enterprises, hospitals and other healthcare providers. Our agreements with our Professional customers
generally resemble the agreements we enter into with customers in our Consumer business unit. As with our
Consumer business unit, we are pursuing a “concept supplier” approach also in our Professional business
unit. For details, see “—Our Strategy—Partner of Choice for Our Customers”. For example, we can offer
customers of our Professional business unit that want to be able to offer their customers sustainable tissue
solutions our own range of sustainable brands as well as product innovations, and we collaborate with our
customers on circular solutions such as hand towel return services. We are also seeking to expand the use of
e-commerce as well as direct sales to end customers. In addition, our Professional business unit also serves the
consumer market, where we deliver our products directly to our customers.

**OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES**

**New Business Areas Business Unit**

In addition to our two core business units Consumer and Professional, we have recently set up a “New Business
Areas” business unit. In line with our vision to be the most sustainable, best-in-class partner for personal and
professional hygiene solutions, this business unit seeks to expand our product and service portfolio through a
focus on innovation, e-commerce and circular economy. In particular, our new business unit serves to develop
new products and services through phase-gate processes. For example, it has developed a multi-purpose towel
in an easily accessible box instead of on a roll like traditional kitchen towels. Our e-commerce business expands
sales channels to “business to consumers” business for specialty products such as our design recycled toilet
paper distributed under the brand “snyce”. Through our e-commerce business, we are increasing our
capabilities for direct deliveries to end consumers, customer data analysis and digital communication. With
regard to both its investment and its e-commerce activities, our new business unit is closely co-operating with
our existing Consumer and Professional business units as well as our Parent’s subsidiary WEPA Ventures
GmbH, which aims to identify innovative and sustainable business ideas from start-ups and invest in their
development at an early stage. Investments by WEPA Ventures GmbH primarily focus on technologies that
enable circular economy processes as well as business ideas along the value chain, particularly in the areas of
renewable energies and water.

**Sale of Semi-Finished Products**

Aside from the sale of tissue products to our customers in the Consumer and the Professional business units,
we also generate sales revenues from the sale semi-finished products, including jumbo reels and de-inked pulp.

**_Sale of Jumbo Reels_**

While we primarily produce tissue paper for our own needs, we also sell excess jumbo reels to other tissue
paper producers. Our customers include tissue paper converting companies and tissue paper manufacturers
that require jumbo reels of certain specifications, such as recycled paper. Other tissue paper producers buy
jumbo reels from us to reduce their own logistics costs. In 2022, we sold 29,000 tons of jumbo reels and our
sales revenue from such sales amounted to €49.3 million, accounting for 3.0% of our total revenues. The
amount of jumbo reels sold to third parties varies and primarily depends on our demand for jumbo reels as
well as the demand for and supply of jumbo reels within our Group.

**_Sale of De-inked Pulp_**

We own technically advanced facilities for the recycling of recovered paper in Arnsberg, Giershagen, Mainz,
Kriebstein, Germany, Swalmen, the Netherlands and Château-Thierry, France with a total annual capacity of
more than 390,000 tons of de-inked pulp production. De-inked pulp is produced as another alternative raw
material next to fresh fiber and is made from recovered paper. It serves as a key ingredient of recycled and
hybrid tissue paper products. While most of the de-inked pulp produced by us is used for the manufacture of
our own tissue paper products, we sell excess amounts to other paper manufacturers in the tissue and other
paper industries, such as manufacturers of corrugated cardboard. The volume of these sales depends on our
excess capacities. Customers of our de-inked pulp include Smurfit, Fripa or Technokarton. In 2022, we sold
approximately 35,000, tons of de-inked pulp to third parties across Europe, which generated €40.7 million in
sales, accounting for 2.5% of our total sales that year. The amount of de-inked pulp sold by us to third parties
varies and primarily depends on our own internal demand for de-inked pulp.

**PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND OTHER PROPERTIES**

Our tissue paper production and converting facilities are located in Germany, France, Italy, Poland, the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom. We currently operate 22 paper machines and more than 80 converting
lines at fourteen production sites. All sites other than Château-Thierry—which is production site solely for
de-inked pulp—and our newly acquired site in Blackburn, United Kingdom—which is a production site solely
for the converting of tissue paper—are vertically integrated and can handle the entire production process
from paper production to finished tissue products. We further had de-inked pulp production sites for the
recycling of recovered paper in Arnsberg, Giershagen, Mainz and Kriebstein, Germany, Swalmen, the
Netherlands, Piechowice, Poland and Château-Thierry, France, with a total annual production capacity of
more than 390,000 tons of de-inked pulp. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have an installed
tissue paper production capacity of 850,000 tons and an installed tissue paper converting capacity of 847,000
tons to convert tissue paper into tissue products.

Approximately 48% of our total production capacity and 45% of our converting capacity is located in
Germany where we have a combined annual stock preparation capacity of approximately 244,000 tons, paper
production capacity of approximately 403,000 tons and an annual converting capacity of approximately
380,000 tons at five different production sites. Three of these production sites (Arnsberg, Giershagen and
Mainz) are located in Western Germany, serving primarily customers in Germany as well as in the BeNeLux
region. Our two production sites in Eastern Germany (Kriebstein and Leuna) also primarily serve the German
market as well as customers in Poland and the Czech Republic.

Our production sites in Italy currently have a combined annual paper production capacity of approximately
114,000 tons and an annual converting capacity of approximately 95,000 tons. The production and converting
capacities are focused towards supplying the Italian market. Our Cassino plant focuses primarily on rolled
products and our Lucca plant focuses on folded products and colored paper. In addition, we have established
our Salanetti plant as a Group-wide competence center for napkin production.

Our two production sites in France have a combined annual paper production capacity of approximately
132,000 tons and a combined annual converting capacity of approximately 155,000 tons. The sites serve
primarily the French market as well as the BeNeLux region. In March 2019, we also acquired our facility for
the recycling of recovered paper in Château-Thierry, France. This state-of-the-art facility, which is solely
focused on the production of de-inked pulp from recovered paper, has an annual capacity of 130,000 tons of
de-inked pulp and is helping us secure a long-term supply of de-inked pulp for our recycled and hybrid tissue


-----

products. The facility is unique in Europe because it is able to produce de-inked pulp that is not only of an
exceptionally high quality and brightness similar to that of fresh fiber, but also has a dryness comparable to
that of fresh fiber. This results in significantly better transportation and storage characteristics, which, in
turn, means that we can either store the de-inked pulp produced at the Château-Thierry facility or ship it for
processing at any of our tissue production facilities or for sale to third parties.

Our gateway to the Eastern European market is our Piechowice plant in Poland. Following the installation of
new paper machines in 2017 and 2021 and the reconstruction of the converting infrastructure, it has an
annual paper production capacity of approximately 65,000 tons and an annual converting capacity of
approximately 63,000 tons. This production and converting site primarily serves as a cost-efficient
manufacturing base for exports both to Western and Eastern European countries, and, with the installation of
the new paper machines, has started to produce and convert high quality products. Production and converting
capacities are balanced. Our plant in Piechowice primarily produces toilet paper, kitchen towels, hand towels
and facial tissues for the professional and consumer markets.

In the United Kingdom, we operate two production sites. Our production site in Bridgend has an annual
paper production capacity of 110,000 tons and an annual converting capacity of approximately 100,000 tons.
It serves primarily customers in the United Kingdom. Between 2020 and 2023, we invested a total of
€96.9 million in a new paper machine at our site in Bridgend. Our second site is located in Blackburn and was
acquired by us in January 2024. It has a tissue paper converting capacity of 27,000 tons p.a. and is focused on
products for our Professional business unit. For further details on the UK Acquisition, see also “Summary—
_Recent Developments”._

Since our acquisition of AfH specialist and family business Van Houtum (now: Wepa Nederland B.V.) in
2017, we operate a production site in Swalmen, the Netherlands designated for the AfH market products,
including our Satino by WEPA and BlackSatino brands. The site has an annual paper production capacity of
28,000 tons and an annual converting capacity of 27,000 tons.

Our production site in Poland is located on real property used by us on the basis of a permanent usufruct
right, with a fixed term until 2089. We also own a 249,422 square meter property in an industrial extension
area of Otmuchow, Poland for potential extension purposes. For the same purpose, we acquired a property of
27,229 square meters, which is currently still agricultural land, in Arnsberg, Germany.

**PROCUREMENT/PURCHASING**

**Overview**

Our most important input materials include pulp, recovered paper, energy and logistics, which collectively
accounted for 72% of our total procurement volume in 2022. We experienced sharp increases in the prices of
most of our input materials, including energy, logistics and recovered paper, through 2021 and 2022 due to
various factors, including global supply and demand imbalances and logistical disruptions as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion in Ukraine, as well as changes in global trade patterns.

Although pulp prices remained relatively stable and low for most of 2022, they increased swiftly to
unprecedented high gross prices and plateaued at the beginning of 2023, largely due to the reasons described
above. The increases in costs of recovered paper were largely due to the effect that COVID-19 pandemic had
on recycling collection rates and hence the availability of paper for recycling.

**2020** **2021** **2022**

Other procurement items, such as packing materials and chemicals, accounted for an aggregate €345.0 million
in 2022.

Our procurement activities are organized at a Group-wide level. Our procurement department separately
manages the procurement of key input materials such as pulp, recovered fiber, energy and auxiliary materials.
By centralizing our purchasing activities, we aim to maximize our pan-European purchasing power, while at
the same time building a high level of expertise. The markets and prices for the most important production
costs in our business, such as pulp, energy and recovered paper, are driven by international supply and demand
and require Group-wide purchasing strategies in order to optimize results. Our strategies include a mixture of
long-term supply contracts and spot purchasing. Price and currency risk management is performed in close
cooperation with our treasury department.

**Pulp and Recovered Paper**

The main raw materials for the production of our tissue paper products are pulp and recovered paper.
Purchasing for both is centralized at our headquarters in Arnsberg. In 2022, we consumed a total of
approximately 572,000 tons of pulp and 395,000 tons of recovered paper. We manage our supplier portfolio
actively, constantly striving to maintain competition among our pulp and recovered paper suppliers. By doing
so, we have been able to improve our average purchasing conditions significantly in recent years. Furthermore,
we are well positioned to make use of opportunities and to react on market developments such as changing
price differences between soft and hardwood pulp grades and the spot market.

For pulp, we aim to contract at least 85% of our demand on the basis of annual contracts with selected,
reliable suppliers, allowing us to ensure the majority of our demand while still being able to use spot
purchasing opportunities. The purchase price in our long-term contracts is either linked to the PIX Index or
subject to monthly negotiations, but might also comprise longer term rolling averages, cap and floor
agreements and fixed prices. While our long-term agreements ensure the availability of pulp, they give only
limited protection in respect of the prices we have to pay. In order to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the
price of pulp, we have developed a specific hedging strategy which involves a multistage process designed to


-----

separately address (i) fluctuations in the market price of pulp, as quoted in U.S. dollars as well as
(ii) fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, our reporting currency and the
currency in which we generate most of our sales revenues. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Result and Operations—Exposure_
_to Fluctuations in Pulp and Recovered Paper Prices”._

For recovered paper we utilize a wide variety of suppliers. For our production process, we require homogenous,
long fiber recovered paper that we purchase predominantly via long term supply agreements, but for which we
also use spot purchasing opportunities. The prices of the supply contracts are typically negotiated on a
monthly basis or fixed for periods of between three and four months. Unlike for pulp, there are no derivative
instruments available that would allow us to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of the recovered
paper grades we require. The only way to lock in recovered paper prices are therefore direct agreements with
our recovered paper suppliers.

**Energy**

Our production processes, in particular the production of de-inked pulp and the operation of our paper
machines, require large amounts of energy. The operation of our paper machines accounts for more than 90%
of our total energy demand and the operation of our converting lines and our de-inking facilities account for
substantially the remainder. Our primary sources of energy are electricity, natural gas and steam. Energy
expenses were our second largest procurement cost item in 2022 and amounted to €263.8 million, or 24.2%, of
our total cost of materials in 2022, compared to €116.3 million, or 16.3%, in 2021 and €76.8 million, or 11.3%,
in 2020. The key drivers of our energy expenses are fluctuations in the market prices for energy, as well as
regulatory decisions. Our total energy expenses have increased during recent years, primarily as a result of
higher production capacities and rising market prices for electricity and natural gas. However, the volatility
and sharp increases in energy prices we experienced during 2021 and 2022, as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and the war in Ukraine, were unprecedented. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Result and Operations—Exposure_
_to Fluctuations in Energy Prices”._

We attempt to limit our exposure to the volatility of electricity and gas prices by covering parts of our
projected energy requirements through fixed future contracts. These contracts are entered into by different
entities within the Wepa Group, mostly at the local level, and have varying durations. For Germany we
typically try to lock in prices, on a rolling basis, for up to 60% (in the short-term even up to 90%, in a staggering
structure), 40% and 20% of our projected energy requirements with regard to the following 12-month period
(Y+1) and each of the subsequent two 12 month periods (Y+2 and Y+3), respectively, subject to developments
in the energy markets. In Italy, we are part of an industrial syndicate which manages energy supply issues and
the related regulatory issues for its members. This includes locking in prices for a portion of projected energy
requirements in coordination between all syndicate members subject to market price developments. At our
site in Giershagen, Germany, approximately 33% of our electric power and almost 100% of our steam
requirements for such site are covered by Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH, a subsidiary of the Issuer operating a
power plant which uses the residual materials from our recycling processes in Arnsberg and Giershagen as a
source of thermal energy.

**Freight/Logistics**

We deliver our products to our customers through external logistics companies. Due to the relatively large size
of our products compared to value, freight and logistics expenses play an important role in our business. The
selection and commissioning of the logistics companies is centrally organized by our logistics department in
Arnsberg, supported by our local organizations in France, Poland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and
Italy. Orders are regularly tendered on web-based tendering platforms for logistics services. Due to
international supply chain disruptions during recent years and the ongoing Russian invasion in Ukraine, the
market for logistical services, especially with regards to truck transportation, has tightened compared to the
available capacity prior to 2020. Due to our focus on collaborating with our logistics providers and increasing
automation and digitalization of logistics, we have been able to secure transportation for our products without
interruption, although we have been impacted by the fluctuations in transportation costs. See also

_Affecting our Result and Operations—Exposure to Fluctuations in Freight/Logistics Costs”._

**REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT**

Our business, and in particular the operation of our production sites, is subject to various regulatory
requirements. Applicable laws and regulations may differ from site to site due to different national and local


-----

laws. The regulatory requirements relate in particular to our production processes and include, inter alia, laws
and regulations relating to health and safety measures for employees, the technical safety requirements for
operating machines, the use and handling of chemicals, air and water emissions, soil contamination and the
management and disposal of waste, hazardous and toxic substances and other materials. For our sites and
operations, we are required to obtain and hold various permits and to comply with the requirements specified
therein. In addition, we are subject to rules that govern the safety of our products and the information we
include on the packaging of our products. We are further subject to foreign trade laws and may be required to
pay export duties or customs duties on materials and products that we export and import. We are subject to
further regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including antitrust laws and zoning and
occupancy laws that generally apply to manufacturing businesses and/or govern the promotion and sale of
certain products we offer, the operation of our facilities and our relationships with customers, suppliers and
competitors. The following is an overview of the main laws and regulations that are relevant to our activities
in Germany. Local laws and regulations that deal with similar aspects apply in other jurisdictions in which we
operate production sites or sell our products.

**Environmental Laws**

We are required to comply with various environmental laws and regulations. In particular, our operations are
subject to laws and regulations designed to limit emissions. This is particularly relevant for our sites that are
located, mostly for historic reasons, in mixed-use areas with nearby residential properties, such as our site in
Arnsberg. In Germany, the construction and operation of paper production and converting facilities such as
ours require a permit under the Federal Emission Control Act (Bundes Immisionsschutzgesetz, “BImSchG”),
which encompasses various approvals necessary for the construction and operation of facilities pursuant to
other laws, including public-law approvals, registrations and consents. The operation of the relevant facility
can generally not be challenged or contested by third parties as long as the respective facility operates in
compliance with its permit. In such cases, third parties can only require certain measures to mitigate any
negative impact of a facility on the environment. To the extent such measures are impossible or uneconomical
to implement based on state-of-the-art technology, the relevant third parties may only claim damages. Permits
and additional administrative orders under the BImSchG may impose certain limitations (e.g. stricter
requirements with regard to permissible emissions or the use of the relevant facilities), with which we have to
comply. A violation of the operator’s duties as determined in the respective permit (or an additional
administrative order) or a modification of the relevant legal standards may also lead to a restriction or, in
severe cases, a prohibition of the further operation of the facility and/or the revocation of its permit under
certain circumstances. The competent authority may even ask for removal of the facility.

Moreover, the operation of our production sites is subject to the various duties of the Federal Water
Management Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz), the State Water Acts in each of the German states
(Landeswassergesetze) and the respective federal and/or state regulations (Rechtsverordnungen). These
regulations govern the use of water during our production, particularly the production of de-inked pulp from
recovered paper and in preparing the liquid base stock (consisting primarily of water and pulp) for use in our
paper machines. According to the Federal Water Management Act, as well as the corresponding state (Länder)
laws, the use of water generally requires the approval by the competent authority. In particular, the extraction
of above-ground water, the discharge of waste water and the pouring and discharge of materials are all aspects
of production that require regulatory approval. In cases of violations of the relevant provisions, we may be
required to pay damages or become subject to penalties. Depending on the type of permit, it may either be
revoked any time or only under certain circumstances.

**Chemicals Legislation and Regulations**

We are subject to Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and
Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”). We use certain chemicals, primarily in connection with the production
of de-inked pulp from recovered paper. The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and
the environment through better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances.
REACH places greater responsibility on industry participants to manage the risks from chemicals and to
provide safety information on the substances. As a “downstream user”pursuant to REACH, we are primarily
required to adhere to the recommended risk reduction measures, to forward our customers and suppliers the
relevant information and, if necessary, to arrange for a chemical safety report to be prepared.

In addition, we are subject to the provisions of the Chemicals Act (Gesetz zum Schutz vor gefährlichen
_Stoffen—Chemikaliengesetz) and related regulations (Rechtsverordnungen). The Chemicals Act is intended to_
minimize the risks from chemicals for humans and the environment. Based on the Chemicals Act and related
regulations, the competent authorities have the power to—among others—require that certain materials or


-----

chemicals (i) may either not be produced, marketed or used at all, (ii) may only be produced, marketed or used
in a certain manner or for specific purposes, (iii) may only be used under certain circumstances or (iv) may
only be distributed to certain persons. We are not aware of any such orders having been issued by the German
government authorities that would have an impact on our business.

**Regulation on Soil Contamination**

Pursuant to the German Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundes Bodenschutzgesetz, “BBodSchG”), the
responsibility for residual pollution and harmful changes to the soil lies with the party who caused a harmful
soil change or a contaminated site, its universal successor, the relevant property owner, the occupant of the
relevant real property and, if the title was transferred after March 1, 1999, the previous owner of the property,
if they knew or must have known about the contamination. There is no general statutory ranking as to which
of the aforementioned parties is primarily liable. Rather, this decision is made at the discretion of the relevant
local authority who will take into account the effectiveness of remediation as a prevailing factor. Thus, the
current owner of the contaminated property is usually the first party to be held responsible because the owner
is generally in the best position to undertake the necessary remediation work. However, the other responsible
parties are required to indemnify the party that carried out the remediation work, regardless of which party is
held liable by the relevant local authority. Where no other arrangements are agreed upon, the obligation to
provide compensation and the extent of the compensation to be provided depend on the extent to which the
hazard or damage was caused primarily by one party or the other. Liability is not based on fault. Thus, the
BBodSchG does not require the relevant local authority to prove negligence or intent on the part of the liable
parties.

According to the BBodSchG the competent authority may require risk inspections, investigations, remedial
measures and other measures necessary for the prevention of residual pollution or harmful changes in the
soil.

**Climate Change and Emission Trading**

In 2003, the European Parliament adopted the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC which was
transformed into national law at the level of the EU member states. Through the trading system for emission
allowances, the EU intends to considerably reduce the output of greenhouse gases. Industrial sites, such as
our paper machines located at our sites within the European Union, to which the EU Emission Trading
System (“ETS”) applies, receive a certain number of allowances to emit greenhouse gases and must surrender
one allowance for each ton of greenhouse gases emitted. Sites that emit fewer tons of greenhouse gases than
their allowances cover are allowed to sell their excess allowances in the open market, whereas those that emit
more are required to buy additional allowances through the ETS. Participation in this system has been
mandatory since 2005 for all industries with high energy consumption levels, including the paper industry.
The emission allowance auctioning was introduced for the manufacturing sector beginning in 2013. Pursuant
to the amended version of the ETS, as modified by the 2018 Directive (EU) 2018/410, the 30% of free
allocations will be reduced after 2026 to 0% by 2030.

Under the ETS, the EU-wide cap of relevant emissions is lowered annually by a certain linear factor. Initially,
the factor amounted to 1.74% of the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU in
the second trading period (2008 through 2012). As part of its Fit for 55 Package, the European Commission
announced in 2021 that the ETS aims to reduce emissions by around 43% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.
According to calculations by the European Commission, sectors covered by the revised ETS, such as the
paper industry, will need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions even more, by 61% compared to 2005 levels.
To achieve this, the annual emissions cap in line with the pathway to meeting the higher 2030 ambition will
need to be lowered. The EU Commission’s proposal is to increase the linear reduction factor from the current
2.2 % to 4.2%. As the fourth trading period has already started and the linear reduction factor can only be
adjusted at a later date, an additional one-off cap reduction is also intended to bring the cap trajectory onto a
linear emissions reduction path from 2021 onwards. As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed
their emission allowances will have to purchase a significant, and steadily increasing, share of emission
allowances in auctions, which may result in substantial additional cost for such companies.

In Germany, the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC has been implemented by the German Greenhouse
Gas Emission Trading Act (Treibhausgas Emissionshandelsgesetz), which provides the basis of the German
emission trading scheme. Moreover, plant operators are required to submit monitoring reports on a regular
basis.


-----

**Other Regulations**

We are affected by the German Renewable Energy Financing Act (Energiefinanzierungsgesetz, “EnFG”) which
forms the basis of a series of German laws that originally provided a feed-in tariff scheme to encourage the
generation of electricity from renewable sources. The EnFG is used to finance the expenditures of the grid
operators under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, “EEG”) and the
Combined Heat and Power Act (Kraft-Wärme-Kopplungsgesetz, “KWKG”) as well as in connection with the
offshore grid connection. The law regulates, inter alia, the compensation of the KWKG financing
requirements and the offshore connection costs by levying levies, the reduction or limitation of levies when
they are levied and a compensation mechanism. The EnFG affects us both financially and administratively.

In Germany, it is also currently expected that certain parts of the German energy tax regulations will be
changed at the beginning of 2024, which could result in significantly lower energy tax reductions for the
German energy-intensive industry. At the same time, a general reduction of the German energy tax to the
European minimum tax level is being discussed to offset potential disadvantages for energy-intensive
companies manufacturing in Germany.

**EMPLOYEES**

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we employed an average of 3,785 employees in six countries, excluding
28 employees of our Parent as well as 14 employees of Wepa.digital GmbH and 2 employees of WEPA
Ventures GmbH, both subsidiaries of our Parent. Both our Parent as well as Wepa.digital GmbH and WEPA
Ventures GmbH provide certain services to us as further described under “Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions”. The number of employees does neither include inactive employees currently in early_
retirement nor employees receiving a company pension.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, an average of 1,739 employees, accounting for 45% of our total
employees, were employed in Germany, again excluding employees of our Parent and its subsidiaries
Wepa.digital GmbH and WEPA Ventures GmbH. During the same period, an average of 2,046 employees
were employed outside of Germany, including 714 employees in France, 452 employees in Italy, 355 employees
in the United Kingdom, 352 employees in Poland and 173 employees in the Netherlands. Our workforce is
characterized by very modest fluctuation levels and the average job tenure of our employees throughout all
our sites is approximately 14.4 years. We consider our loyal, experienced, qualified and motivated employees
as a key asset. With our continuous hiring strategy and various training programs, we are actively managing
the demographic challenges and qualification requirements. For details on our “Best Place to Work” and
“Performance with Care Culture” strategies, see also “—Our Strategy—Establish our Performance with Care
_Culture and Offering the Best Place to Work”. As at December 31, 2022, we had 74 trainees in Germany. In_
addition, we enjoy a constructive working relationship with the relevant labor representatives on group and
site level, including with the labor union IG BCE (Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau, Energie, Chemie) in
Germany, which we believe has contributed to the absence of any significant union action or disputes to date.
Our employees in Germany are also currently represented by a works council (Betriebsrat) or other
representative bodies for employees. In various other countries where we are present, our employees are
represented by local works councils in accordance with local regulations, and we believe that our relationships
with them are generally good.

**INSURANCE**

We maintain various insurance policies for different aspects of our business. These policies are centrally
managed by our insurance department in Arnsberg, with the support of our insurance broker SüdVers. Our
insurance coverage includes all-risk policies insuring against property destruction, damage and loss, as well as
against business interruption directly resulting from any property damage. In addition, we maintain liability
insurance coverage with regard to general operating liability, radiation liability and environmental liability, as
well as transport and accident insurance. We obtain insurance coverage for particular risks based on an
internal risk analysis. We believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage commensurate to our business
and production volumes and in line with industry practice, with deductibles and coverage limits that we
believe to be reasonable and appropriate. We continuously re-evaluate the appropriateness of our insurance
coverage in the ordinary course. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not suffer losses that may
either not be covered by insurance or that may exceed the coverage amount under the relevant insurance
policies.

**LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**

From time to time, we are involved in administrative, legal and arbitration proceedings that arise in the
ordinary course of business. Currently, however, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are involved in any


-----

litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration relating to claims or amounts that are material to our
business and to our knowledge no such litigation, administrative proceeding or arbitration is pending or
threatened.

**INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**

Our IT & Digital department, which consisted of 64 employees (excluding those of our Parent and
Wepa.digital GmbH) as of September 30, 2023, is organized in a decentralized manner. The local IT teams at
each of our sites are supported by our central IT department in Arnsberg, Germany, and an outsourced
external IT provider based in Mumbai, India. On a project-by-project basis, we also make use of the services
of Wepa.digital GmbH, a subsidiary of our Parent based in Düsseldorf, which has a dedicated IT project
team.

We rely on a number of IT systems to support our business operations. We have implemented application
specific measures, such as stable and redundantly-designed IT systems, backup processes, virus and access
protection and encryption systems as well as standardized IT infrastructure and applications. We regularly
test and update our IT systems, and employees receive regular training on information and data protection. In
addition, a business recovery plan is in place that sets forth the procedures to follow in the event of an extended
outage of IT services in order to restore services as quickly as possible.

As such systems are vulnerable to a number of problems, such as software or hardware malfunctions, malicious
hacking, physical damage to vital data centers and computer virus infection, we make continuous investments
to adapt these complex and high-performing systems to changing business processes. In addition, our IT
systems are regularly upgraded to accommodate the expansion of our business and maintain the efficiency of
our operations.

Our core applications are currently being moved into a data center managed by Oracle in Frankfurt am Main,
Germany. Other non-core information technology systems are operated locally by our subsidiaries.

Following the 2022 Cyber Attack, we have further invested into the protection of our IT landscape from cyber
crime and to safeguard our digital assets. We also frequently review our processes to prevent, protect and react
in case of cyber crime events. We plan to continue to invest in our cyber defense capabilities and to continue
to train our user community with a view to improving awareness of cyber crime.

**SUSTAINABILITY**

Since its foundation in 1948, our Group has been oriented towards sustainability. The concept of sustainability
is firmly rooted in our corporate culture and is an integral part of our corporate strategy. Our holistic
philosophy values economic, ecological and social aspects of our performance. As early as 1983, we began
producing recycled tissue paper and subsequently started to invest significantly in facilities for the recycling of
recovered paper and in developing recycled tissue products. In 2010, we were the first tissue producer in
Europe to launch a range of high quality “hybrid” toilet paper and kitchen towels based on fresh fiber, but
with a minimum of 30% of recycled fiber content added to the raw material mix. Over the years, we have
gained significant additional expertise in recycled and hybrid products. Today, we believe we are the leading
producer of tissue products from recovered paper and hybrid products in Europe by volume. In the twelvemonth period ended September 30, 2023, approximately 50% of the finished products produced by us
consisted of recycled or hybrid tissue products, with 22.2% of our finished products being recycled paperbased products (of which 0.6%, or approximately 4,700 tons, related to our new OCC-based products in the
first year of introduction) and 25.4% being hybrid paper products. This compares to only approximately 41%
of finished products produced by us in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2019 that consisted of
recycled or hybrid products, with only 20.1% of our finished products at such time being recycled paper-based
products and 17.2% being hybrid paper products. Our leading market position in the field of recycled and
hybrid tissue products is supported by our well-invested asset base for the recycling of recovered paper in
Arnsberg, Giershagen, Mainz and Kriebstein, Germany, Swalmen, the Netherlands, Piechowice, Poland and
Château-Thierry, France, with a total annual production capacity of more than 390,000 tons of de-inked
pulp.

In addition to our strong focus on recovered paper for the production of tissue paper, we have also become an
innovation leader for sustainable tissue products and operations. With our retailer customers increasingly
relying on their suppliers, such as us, to meet their own sustainability goals and with end-consumer demand
for products made from sustainable fibers continuously increasing, we have implemented our “4+1 Strategy”.
This strategy defines our sustainability goals in four distinct areas into which we have divided our sustainability
efforts: (i) future fibers, (ii) sustainable production, (iii) sustainable products and (iv) portfolio extension


-----

through innovation. The guiding principle for all of these goals and for how we want to operate as a business
is a strong value foundation (i.e. the “+1” in our “4+1 Strategy”) that encourages responsible conduct as an
employer, social commitment, compliance and product safety. For further information on our 4+1 Strategy,
see “—Our Strategy—Strong Commitment to Sustainability”. As part of our 4+1 Strategy, we have already
been able to reduce the emissions from our own production facilities, including purchased steam, and our
emissions generated from the use of purchased electricity by 16.7% by the end of 2022, compared to 2019.

As part of our increased focus on sustainability, we have recently developed new sustainable fibers made from
both OCC and miscanthus grass. We have been conducting research and development on miscanthus grass, a
particularly environmentally friendly raw material, since 2013. Due to the high cellulose content and rapid
growth of miscanthus grass, it has a particularly high yield of fiber. Miscanthus grass can be cultivated under
eco-friendly conditions (without fertilization or pesticides) because its roots remain in the soil after harvesting,
and extraction of miscanthus grass is extremely efficient. Due to these impressive features of fiber made from
miscanthus grass, we recently launched a new product line of toilet paper and paper towels in our Professional
business unit that combines the unbleached cellulose fibers of miscanthus grass with recovered paper from
paper cups, office paper and used paper towels.

Our sustainability efforts have been validated with various eco-labels and certifications for our products, such
as the “Blue Angel” (“Blauer Engel”) label in Germany, the EU Ecolabel and the Nordic Swan for Europe.
Furthermore, we were also awarded with a Silver Star award in EcoVadis’s sustainability rating, our
miscanthus-based product line BlackSatino GreenGrow has been awarded with the Purus Innovation Award
2023 and our Satino PureSoft products, made from OCC, have been awarded with the German Bundespreis
Ecodesign 2023 award. As a result, we are seeing an increasing demand for these products from retail and
commercial customers as well as the end consumer, which is driven by an increased general focus on
sustainability and the impact of human activity on the environment.

**QUALITY CONTROL**

We focus extensively on operational excellence with the objective of achieving a consistent and positive overall
consumer and customer experience. Our quality control standards are given a high level of importance and
are generally in line with the standards set by other reputable multinational competitors. In addition, we
established a groupwide “Quality Initiative” program to further strengthen important aspects like awareness,
communication as well as training and qualification.

Our internal quality controls include:

- Auditing of supplier qualifications;

- Consistent testing of production, sampling of finished products for workmanship and physical testing
for compliance to pre-approved specifications;

- Generating key performance indicators along with detailed test reports on all semi-finished and finished
products;

- Holding bi-monthly executive meetings to review results, track progress on major issues/opportunities
and set goals as needed;

- Establishing a Rapid Response and Retrieval system (or “RRR”) across our Group, including mock
recall exercises to promote preparedness; and

- Tracking all major start-ups by quality assurance and providing detailed reports to management
throughout the new product development process. All products receive annual specification reviews with
product development and marketing stakeholders.

Our third-party controls include:

- Auditing of all plants according to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 50001;

- Certification and auditing of nearly all plants according to IFS Standard;

- Routine customer-initiated third-party audits of our sites; and

- Ranking of performance along key important customer metrics by independent surveys.

**RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**

We consider research and development to be an important factor in staying competitive and strengthening
our customer relationships, in particular with a view to the continued implementation of our “concept sales”


-----

approach as further described under “—Our Strength—Partner of Choice for Our Customers” and our focus
on inventions in the area of sustainability. In order to ensure a constant flow of know-how and close
technological cooperation between our various Group companies, we centrally coordinate our research and
development activities through a small research department in our facility in Mainz, Germany. Due to our
product portfolio, which consists primarily of standardized, commodity-like tissue paper products, our budget
for research and development measures is, compared to other industries with higher innovation pressure,
relatively low. At the same time, due to our increased focus on sustainability issues as further described under
“—Sustainability”above, also our sustainability team materially contributes to our research and development
activities.

Our research and development activities are primarily focused on the constant improvement of our products
and production processes. In close cooperation with our customers, we constantly work on increasing the
quality of our products, such as softness and strength. We also regularly discuss and evaluate with our
customers their tissue paper product portfolio, the further development of our existing products as well as
special promotions by our customers. We believe that continuous contact with customers across almost all of
our product families, coupled with the scale of our operations, gives us a specific advantage in product and
process development. In addition, both our research and production departments have a strong focus on
constantly improving and optimizing our manufacturing process, aiming to reduce manufacturing, raw
material and transportation costs.

**SALES AND MARKETING**

Our sales and marketing team primarily develops and strengthens new and existing customer relationships
and acquires new orders and business. It plays an essential part in the continued implementation of our
“concept sales”approach as further described under “—Our Strength—Partner of Choice for Our Customers”.
In addition to the acquisition of orders and their handling, the team is also responsible for product
specifications and pricing. The team consisted of an average of 156 employees in 2022. The majority of team
members are located at our headquarters in Arnsberg, which is responsible for regional sales activities in
Germany as well as the coordinating and developing our group wide sales and marketing strategies and
activities. Our local Group companies in Italy, France, Poland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are
given certain responsibility for regional sales activities in their respective regions. Our Consumer business unit
accounts for approximately 60% of our marketing and sales team, while the remaining 40% of team members
are active for our Professional business unit or involved in the sale of semi-finished products.

Our marketing team is tasked with market research and supporting the sales team with marketing tools to
optimize our customer portfolios and to build brand equity for our smaller brand business. It plays a strategic
advisory role with retailers, assisting with category management and efficient promotional and shelf
assortment initiatives. Compared to branded label tissue producers, our marketing expense is low.

**SHAREHOLDERS**

Our Parent based in Arnsberg, Germany, registered in the Commercial Register of the Local Court of
Arnsberg under HRB 8504, with business address Rönkhauser Straße 26, 59757 Arnsberg, Germany, holds
all shares of the Issuer. The registered share capital of the Issuer amounts to €18,100,000 as at September 30,
2023 and is fully paid up. The Parent became the holding company of the Wepa Group in 2009 as part of a
reorganization of the Wepa Group to streamline the organizational structure and operations of the Wepa
Group following its expansion in prior years.

The shares of the Parent, which has a share capital of €201,037, are indirectly held by members of the Krengel
family and the WEPA Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Krengel family. WEPA
Foundation does not have any voting rights in our Parent.

**MANAGEMENT**

**OVERVIEW**

Our group is managed by a management team consisting of the managing directors (Geschäftsführer) and the
senior management of the Issuer. The managing directors of the Issuer are Martin Krengel, Ralph Dihlmann,
Andreas Krengel, Harm Bergmann-Kramer and Menno Oosterhoff (the “Managing Directors”). Martin
Krengel serves as Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Dihlmann as Chief Financial Officer, Harm BergmannKramer as Chief Operating Officer, Andreas Krengel as Chief Executive Officer of our Professional Business
Unit and our New Business Areas Business Unit, and Menno Oosterhoff as Chief Executive Officer of our
Consumer Business Unit. They are supported by an experienced senior management team within a matrix
organization, mainly consisting of the divisional heads within the business units and group functions for
Sales & Marketing, Business Development, Supply Chain, Mill Operations, Procurement, Fiber & Energy,
IT & Digital, Business Resilience, Controlling, Legal, Accounting, People & Culture, Sustainability, Strategy &
Transformation as well as Innovation and E-commerce.

The Managing Directors also serve as members of the management board of the Parent. The Parent,
incorporated as an European Company (Societas Europaea—SE), is the sole shareholder of the Issuer. Due
to the 100% ownership of Issuer by the Parent, the management board of the Parent (the “Management
**Board”) and supervisory board (the “Supervisory Board”) have, either directly or indirectly, a significant**
influence on the business of our Group.

**MANAGEMENT BOARD OF THE ISSUER**

The Issuer is organized as a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung/GmbH)
under the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter
_Haftung/GmbHG) and is managed by the Managing Directors. The Managing Directors, which form the_
management board (Geschäftsführung) of the Issuer, are appointed by the Parent as the sole shareholder of
the Issuer. The current bylaws of the Issuer require that one or more managing directors need to be appointed
to the Issuer’s management board. The Issuer is legally represented by at least two managing directors or one
managing director together with an authorized proxy (Prokurist) acting jointly.

The Managing Directors are responsible for managing the day-to-day business of the company. Each
Managing Director is under a duty to act in accordance with applicable laws, the bylaws and the rules of
procedure for the Managing Directors as well as in accordance with his respective service agreement.
According to the rules of procedure of the management board of the Issuer, transactions and dealings which
exceed certain thresholds require the consent of the shareholder’s meeting of the Issuer (the “Shareholder’s
**Meeting”). In such cases, due to parallel rules of procedure for the Managing Directors of the Issuer and the**
Management Board of the Parent, ultimately, such transactions and dealings will require the approval of the
Supervisory Board of the Parent.

The Shareholder’s Meeting may issue instructions which are binding upon the Managing Directors. However,
as the corporate governance of the Issuer generally provides for the same persons to serve as Managing
Directors as on the Management Board, the Shareholder’s Meeting ability to give instructions has limited
relevance. Instructions that would result in violations of mandatory provisions of German corporate law and
in particular, capital maintenance rules, are in any event prohibited.

The Managing Directors of the Issuer are:

-----

members of the Management Board consists of a fixed component and variable compensation elements. The
fixed component comprises a base salary and payments in kind. The variable components include annually
recurring components tied to business performance, as well as components that offer long-range incentives
and that are tied to risk taking. The base salary is paid in twelve equal monthly instalments. The payments in
kind to the members of the Management Board consist mainly of the use of company vehicles. The variable
component is granted primarily in accordance with the Wepa Group business performance indicators (e.g.
EBIT, EBITDA and free cash flow). The details are established annually by mutual agreement. The variable
components can include a cap.

The total compensation (incl. provisions for severance pay) of the members of the Management Board
amounted to €6.5 million in 2022. This amount included fixed salaries, payments in kind and variable
performance-related compensation. Payments in kind included the use of company cars, payment of hotel
expenses, travel expenses and premiums for accident insurance.

also the management of the Issuer. It is not authorized to exercise itself management functions. However,
pursuant to the articles of association of the Parent, the rules of procedure for the Managing Directors and of
the Management Board and, as the case may be, resolutions of the Supervisory Board, certain types of
transactions and dealings exceeding certain thresholds or being outside the ordinary course of business may
only be entered into with the approval of the Supervisory Board. Approval is generally required before a
transaction is executed. The Management Board must also regularly report to the Supervisory Board (at least
quarterly) on the course of business, with particular reference to revenue and the status of the Parent and its
subsidiaries, including the Issuer. Same as the members of the Management Board, also the members of the
Supervisory Board have duties of loyalty and due diligence towards the Parent.

Pursuant to the current articles of association, the Supervisory Board currently consists of three members, all
of whom have been elected at the annual general meeting (ordentliche Hauptversammlung) (“Annual General
Meeting”) of the Parent. Unless the Annual General Meeting decides on a shorter term of office for
prospective members at the time of the election or for all the members of the Supervisory Board, the members
of the Supervisory Board are elected for a term ending upon conclusion of the Annual General Meeting at
which the Supervisory Board is discharged of its duties for the fourth financial year following commencement
of the term of office. The financial year in which the term of office commences is not counted.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**CENTRAL SERVICES AND COST ALLOCATION AGREEMENT WITH WEPA SE**

On July 1, 2009, the Issuer and other members of the Wepa Group entered into an agreement on central
services and cost allocation with the Parent, which is the ultimate parent holding company of the Wepa
Group (the “Central Services and Cost Allocation Agreement”). Under the Central Services and Cost
Allocation Agreement, the Parent provides certain central services to various entities of the Wepa Group.
These services include support in the following areas: coordination and general management, legal, tax and
management consultancy, funding, human resources (including recruiting, remuneration advice, policy advice
and the preparation and implementation of vocational training programs), finance and accounting,
production planning, raw material procurement and marketing and sales. Under the terms of the Central
Services and Cost Allocation Agreement, Wepa Group companies are entitled, but not required, to make use
of the services offered by the Parent.

Any costs incurred by the Parent in providing services pursuant to the Central Services and Cost Allocation
Agreement are allocated among the different Wepa Group companies in accordance with a cost allocation
mechanism set forth in the Central Services and Cost Allocation Agreement. The prices the Parent charges
within the Wepa Group are intended to represent arm’s length terms, i.e. prices we believe are broadly similar
to those a third-party would charge for comparable services. In 2022 and the first nine months of 2023, the
Parent charged the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries a total consideration of €11.6 million and
€7.9 million, respectively, for its services under the Central Services and Cost Allocation Agreement.

**OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH AFFILIATED PARTIES**

**Accounting Services to Affiliates**

The Issuer provides certain accounting services to a number of other subsidiaries of the Parent: Wepa Ventures
GmbH, Wepa.digital GmbH, Windpark Lattenberg 1 GmbH, Windpark Lattenberg 2 GmbH, Wepa Green
GmbH, Wepa Solar Power GmbH and Wepa Real Estate GmbH. Except for Wepa Ventures GmbH and
Wepa.digital GmbH, these entities do not yet have any significant operations. The prices we charge these
entities for our services are intended to represent arm’s length terms, i.e. prices we believe are broadly similar
to those a third-party would charge for comparable services. In 2022 and the first nine months of 2023, we
charged these entities a combined total of €15,300 and €14,175, respectively, for our accounting services.

**Lease Agreement between Wepa Deutschland GmbH & Co KG and HPO GmbH**

Pursuant to a lease agreement dated 4 April 2009, Wepa Deutschland GmbH rents a small warehouse
including some offices and common rooms located immediately adjacent to our main headquarters in
Arnsberg from HPO Beteiligungs GmbH, an entity owned by Wolfgang Krengel, Joachim Krengel and Martin
Krengel, for annual rental payments of approximately €28,000.

**Lease Agreement between Wepa Deutschland GmbH & Co KG and Wepa Real Estate GmbH**

Pursuant to a lease agreement initially entered into with the previous owner of the property, Wepa
Deutschland GmbH rents a commercial property with a total size of approximately 8,000 square meters
located in Rüthen, Germany from Wepa Real Estate GmbH, a subsidiary of our Parent. As the property
currently does not comply with applicable fire safety regulations, we currently only use an area of
approximately 800 square meters, which consists of a small office and an adjacent workshop. Wepa Real
Estate GmbH acquired the property effective October 2, 2023 from the previous owner who was not prepared
to make investments we estimate at approximately €600,000 which will be required to bring the property into
compliance with fire safety regulations in order to make it fully usable again.

Although the existing lease agreement provides for an annual rent of €230,000, we currently only pay a
monthly rent of €1,000 for the small office and adjacent workshop. We intend to renegotiate the lease
agreement with Wepa Real Estate GmbH following completion of the required fire safety investments and
once we are able to use the full property again.

**Lease Agreement between Wepa Deutschland GmbH & Co KG and the Parent**

Pursuant to a lease agreement effective as of 1 January 2021, the Parent rents certain spaces it uses at our main
headquarters in Arnsberg from Wepa Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, for annual rental payments of
approximately €25,000.


-----

**IT Services from Wepa.digital GmbH**

Wepa.digital GmbH, a subsidiary of our Parent, is providing certain IT and digitalization services to different
entities within our Group, including, amongst others, digital development projects such as (i) WEPA.Cloud/BI
(cloud platform, based on Microsoft Azure, which is becoming the central WEPA wide platform for data
storage and data analytics), (ii) DIGITAL WORKPLACE (tools for remote working, desk sharing
infrastructure, modern communications displays, etc.), (iii) SMART FACTORY (connecting all
manufacturing equipment within the production sites to optimize machine energy settings, optimize recipes
to reduce material costs and optimize machine maintenance) and (iv) ROBOT PROCESS AUTOMATION
(automation of simple, repetitive tasks—predominantly in the administration). Wepa.digital GmbH invoices
the costs of these services to us on a monthly basis. In 2022 and the first nine months of 2023, we paid
Wepa.digital GmbH a combined total of approximately €1.8 million and €2.5 million, respectively, for its IT
and digitalization services.

**Consulting services rendered by Dr. Wurster**

Before 2020, Dr. Wurster, who serves as member of the Supervisory Board of our Parent, at times rendered
consulting services to the management board of our Parent in relation to technical projects and the availability
of pulp. The conditions of such engagement include an hourly fee of €250 (net) and the reimbursement of
travel expenses incurred in connection with the rendering of such services. The retention of the consulting
services by Dr. Wurster has been approved by the Supervisory Board of our Parent. While the consulting
agreement is still in place, Dr. Wurster has not rendered any consultancy services, and has not received any
consideration, since 2020.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following includes a summary of the terms of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, the Super Senior Revolving_
_Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement and certain other financing arrangements._

**EXISTING FIXED RATE NOTES**

On December 12, 2019, the Issuer issued €350.0 million and on February 10, 2020, the Issuer issued an
additional €50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2027 (the
“Existing Fixed Rate Notes”). The Existing Fixed Rate Notes are governed by the Existing Fixed Rate Notes
conditions of issue dated as of December 12, 2019 and mature on December 15, 2027. The documentation
required to implement the issue of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes is referred to as the “Existing Fixed Rate

The Existing Fixed Rate Notes are guaranteed by Wepa Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Wepa Professional
GmbH, Wepa Italia S.r.l., Wepa France S.A.S., Wepa Greenfield S.A.S., Wepa UK Ltd, Wepa Piechowice Sp.
z o.o., Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH and Wepa Reserve GmbH. The Existing Fixed Rate Notes are secured by first
ranking liens over shares of or the partnership interests in the Issuer, each Guarantor (other than Wepa Italia
S.r.l.) and Wepa Deutschland Verwaltungs GmbH, any machinery and equipment and real property in
Germany, certain machinery and equipment in the United Kingdom as well as any loans of the Parent against
the Issuer.

The Existing Fixed Rate Notes constitute senior obligations of the Issuer and rank: (i) equal in right of
payment with the Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the
Existing Fixed Rate Notes (including obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority
Hedging Liabilities and Cash Management Liabilities), (ii) senior in right of payment to any existing and
future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Existing Fixed Rate
Notes, (iii) effectively senior in right of payment to existing or future unsecured obligations of the Issuer, to
the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations of the Issuer under the
Existing Fixed Rate Notes, (iv) effectively subordinated to existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer and its
subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Existing Fixed Rate Notes, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness and (v) structurally subordinated to
all indebtedness and obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Existing Fixed Rate
Notes.

Since December 15, 2022, the Issuer may at any time redeem on any one or more occasions all or part of the
Existing Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus the applicable premium, to but not including the date
of redemption. Additionally, since December 15, 2022, the Issuer may redeem at its option up to 35% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes (including any the original aggregate principal
amount of additional notes issued under the Existing Fixed Rate Notes conditions of issue) with the net
proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 102.875% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, provided that at
least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant series of Existing Fixed Rate Notes (including the
original aggregate principal amount of any additional notes issued under the Existing Fixed Rate Notes
conditions of issue) remains outstanding after such redemption.

Since December 15, 2022, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Existing
Fixed Rate Notes, at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) set forth below,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption
date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on December 15 of the years indicated below,
subject to the rights of holders of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest

101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. The relevant change of control triggering events are defined in
the Existing Fixed Rate Notes conditions of issue and subject to exemptions.

**SUPER SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY**

On April 29, 2013, the Issuer and certain subsidiaries of the Issuer as original borrowers and guarantors
entered into a super senior revolving credit facility agreement, as amended from time to time and as last
amended pursuant to an amendment agreement dated 18 March 2022 (the “Super Senior Revolving Credit
**Facility Agreement”). The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for €150 million of**
committed financing (the “Total Commitments”), whereby funds are made available under a revolving facility
(the “Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility”) for utilization by way of the drawing of cash revolving loans in
euro and other currencies, and by way of ancillary facilities, until the date falling one month prior to the
Termination Date (as defined below).

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility provides, among others, the following terms: (i) no requirements
for mandatory prepayments and related cancellation of commitments in connection with the receipt of listing
proceeds, (ii) a note purchase condition providing flexibility in connection with potential future refinancings
and/or debt repayments, (iii) an EBITDA- and gross asset-based guarantor coverage test with a relevant
threshold of 80 per cent. contribution of the Guarantor group to, in each case, the Group’s consolidated
EBITDA and/or gross assets, and (iv) a threshold for an entity to become a Material Subsidiary (as defined in
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) of 10 per cent. contribution of the relevant entity to, in each case,
the Group’s Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) and/or gross
assets.

Borrowings under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility may be used to finance the general corporate
purposes (including any capital expenditure, restructuring expenses and acquisitions) of the Group.

Borrowers under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility include the Issuer, Wepa Deutschland GmbH &
Co. KG, Wepa France S.A.S., Wepa Greenfield S.A.S., Wepa Piechowice Sp. z o.o., Wepa Reserve GmbH,
Wepa UK Ltd and Wepa Italia S.r.l. Furthermore, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed
by the Guarantors and benefits from certain collateral granted by the Parent and certain of the Guarantors
(as defined below under “—Security and Guarantees”) and the Issuer. The facility agent (the “Agent”) under
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft.

**_Ancillary Facilities_**

Subject to a limit of €75 million for the use of ancillary facilities under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, a lender (or its affiliates) may make available to a borrower under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility all or part of that lender’s undrawn commitment in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility by way
of ancillary facilities such as overdraft facilities, guarantees, bonding, documentary or stand-by letter of credit
facilities, short-term loans, foreign exchange facilities or any other facility or accommodation required in
connection with the business of the Group and which is agreed between the relevant borrower and the relevant
lender (or its affiliate), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent.


-----

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility terminates the earlier of (i) 15 September 2026 (if at such time the
€200 million senior secured floating rate notes issued by the Issuer and maturing 1 December 2026 have not
been redeemed and/or refinanced in full from proceeds of the issuance of the Existing Floating Rate Notes,
other new senior secured notes or any other senior or subordinated financings), or otherwise
(ii) 31 December 2026 (the “Termination Date”) and any amounts still outstanding at such date will be
immediately due and payable.

Subject to certain conditions, we may voluntarily prepay our utilizations and/or permanently cancel all or
part of the available commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility by giving at least five
(5) business days’ prior notice to the Agent (provided that such prepayment or cancellation must be, if in part,
in a minimum amount of €1 million) or (in case of a cancellation only) the remainder if the remaining
commitments are less than €1 million, limited to a maximum of four (4) voluntary prepayments of any loan
which is not in EUR or USD in any calendar year.

Amounts repaid may (subject to the terms of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) be reborrowed.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

- with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender or any of its affiliates to perform any of
its obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility;

- subject to certain criteria, from net insurance proceeds in relation to assets subject to transaction security;

- under the circumstances described under the second bullet under “—Purchase Condition” below; and

- upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, where “Change of Control” means that:

(i) Martin Krengel, Wolfgang Krengel and Jochen Krengel and any of their respective heirs and any
person controlled (directly or indirectly) by any of them (the “Permitted Holders”) cease directly or
indirectly to hold 50 per cent. or more of the issued shares in the Issuer (measured by voting power
rather than number of shares); or

(ii) all or substantially all of the assets of the Group are sold.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility initially bears interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR or,
with respect to any loans utilized in US Dollar, Term SOFR or in GBP, SONIA, plus, in case of any loan
utilized in GBP or USD, 25 percentage points, plus a margin within a ratchet between 1.75 per cent. per
annum and 4.05 per cent. per annum based on the Leverage Ratio (as defined below) at each quarter end.
Such interest rate is further adjusted by deducting or adding up to 10 basis points on the then applicable rate
of interest depending on the fulfillment of certain environmental, social or governance performance
indicators.

“Leverage Ratio” means, in respect of any relevant period, the ratio of total net debt on the last day of that
relevant period to consolidated EBITDA in respect of that relevant period. A relevant period is a period of
12 months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31 in any year.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on the last day of each successive period of
three months during the availability period and on the last day of the availability period on available but
unused commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (and, if a lender’s commitment is
cancelled in full, on the cancelled amount at the time the cancellation is effective) at a rate of 30 per cent. of
the applicable margin under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

Furthermore, we are required to pay fees related to the issuance of ancillary facilities and certain fees to the
Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed irrevocably and unconditionally, subject to certain
customary limitations and agreed security principles, on a joint and several basis, by the Issuer, Wepa
Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Wepa Professional GmbH, Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH, Wepa Reserve GmbH,
Wepa Piechowice Sp. z o.o., Wepa Italia S.r.l., Wepa France S.A.S., Wepa Greenfield S.A.S. and Wepa UK Ltd


-----

(the “Guarantors”). Furthermore, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is secured by first-ranking liens
(subject to certain perfection requirements, exceptions and limitations) over (a) all the shares of or the
partnership interests in the Issuer, each Guarantor (other than Wepa Italia S.r.l.) and Wepa Deutschland
Verwaltungs GmbH, as applicable; (b) all existing and future loans held by the Parent against the Issuer,
(c) certain machinery and equipment of the Issuer, Wepa Professional GmbH, Wepa Deutschland GmbH &
Co. KG and Wepa UK Ltd and (d) certain real property of the Issuer and Wepa Deutschland GmbH & Co.
KG.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility also provides that (subject to certain customary limitations and
the agreed security principles):

- on any accounting reference date (i.e., each December 31), the aggregate gross assets and earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the Guarantors (in each case calculated on an
unconsolidated basis and excluding all intra group items and investments in subsidiaries of any member
of the Group and provided that the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of any
entity that is negative shall be deemed to be zero) must represent not less than 80% of the Group’s gross
assets and Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) (with the
EBITDA of any entity that is negative deemed to be zero provided that where any member of the Group
has negative EBITDA, its EBITDA shall be deemed to be zero in the denominator and the numerator)
(the “Guarantor Coverage Test”) and if such percentages are not met, one member or more members of
the Group must become a guarantor under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement until
such percentages are met; and

- if on any accounting reference date (i.e., each December 31) there a member of the Group which is not a
guarantor but which has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization calculated on the
same basis as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility)
representing 10% or more of Consolidated EBITDA or which has gross assets representing 10% or more
of the gross assets of the Group, in each case, after elimination of all intra-Group items (the “Material
**Subsidiary Test”), such member of the Group must become a guarantor under the Super Senior**
Revolving Credit Facility,

and in each case grant security as the Agent may require, within 60 days following delivery of relevant annual
financial statements evidencing non-compliance with the Guarantor Coverage Test or Material Subsidiary
Test, if such member of the Group is incorporated in the same jurisdiction as a Guarantor, and (y), in each
other case, within 90 days.

**_Covenants_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility contains customary information and affirmative loan style
covenants and also includes restrictive covenants that replicate those contained in the documentation required
to implement the issue of the Notes (the “Senior Notes Documents”). The Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility also contains a “spring-in” leverage covenant, pursuant to which we are required to ensure that the
Leverage Ratio does not exceed (for the period ending December 31, 2022) 6.50:1 in respect to any quarterly
testing period (i.e., any twelve months period ending on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31)
and with respect to any proposed utilization date, if the aggregate amount of drawdowns under the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility (together with all utilizations (in whatever form) made under any ancillary
facility (but excluding letters of credit and bank guarantees other than to the extent issued for cash loans or
similar instruments)) exceeds, or would on any proposed utilization date exceed, 50 per cent. of the total
commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The relevant trigger level for testing such
“spring-in” leverage covenant will decrease to a Leverage Ratio not exceeding 5.50:1 for the period from
January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, to 5.25:1 for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024
and to 5.00:1 for the period from January 1, 2025 onward.

A breach of the financial covenant for not more than two times during the life of the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility will not constitute an event of default under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement if (a) on the testing date on which the breach occurs at least EUR 150,000,000 are committed
under Qualified Securitization Financings for at least a further six months; (b) the financial condition is
complied with on the next testing date and (c) in relation to a second breach, the Issuer has complied with the
financial covenant following the first breach or would have complied with such financial condition even if the
financial covenant was not tested due to the trigger level for testing such “spring-in” leverage covenant set out
in the preceding paragraph not being met.


-----

The financial covenant may also be amended or waived in whole or in part in accordance with the terms of the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. If the Issuer has notified the Agent that a possible breach of the
financial covenant may occur, then the lenders and the Issuer shall enter into good faith negotiations with a
view to finding a solution to the event or circumstance that has given rise to such possible breach, provided,
however, that any such negotiations shall not in any way whatsoever restrict the finance parties in exercising
any of their rights under the finance documents as they, in their sole discretion, consider appropriate and the
entry into of any such negotiations shall not constitute a waiver or allow for a delay or postponement of any
testing dates or the delivery of any compliance certificates in relation to the financial covenant.

**_Purchase Condition_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility only allows members of the Group to prepay, purchase, defease or
redeem (or otherwise retire for value) or acquire any Senior Secured Debt (as defined below) prior to its stated
maturity (or offer to do so) if:

- such purchase is funded, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Refinancing Indebtedness (as
defined in the Conditions of Issue), Subordinated Shareholder Debt (as defined in the Conditions of
Issue) or a contribution to the equity of the Issuer (other than by a subsidiary of the Issuer) in accordance
with the restrictive covenants under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (which closely track those
that will be contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes;

- such purchase is made following the occurrence of a Change of Control and the Issuer has fully complied
with (or will comply with) its obligations in relation to such Change of Control as set out under
“—Repayments and Prepayments” above prior to any such purchase; or

- following the completion of the purchase, Senior Secured Debt with an aggregate principal amount
equal to 50 per cent. or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes will remain outstanding,

unless, in each case, a default is continuing or would result from the purchase.

“Senior Secured Debt”means the aggregate principal amount outstanding, from time to time, under the Notes
and any other liabilities of the Issuer, the borrowers under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility or the
Guarantors in respect of any loan, credit or guarantee facility, notes, indenture or security that rank equally
in right of payment with the liabilities under the Notes and which are permitted under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement to share (and do share or (as the context may require) will share) in the security
interests created under the Transaction Documents (as defined under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) on an equal and rateable basis as the creditors in relation to the Notes.

**_Events of Default_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility contains customary events of default (subject in certain cases to
agreed grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications) including, a cross default with respect to an event of
default under, and as defined in, the Senior Notes Documents, non-payment, misrepresentation, breach of
covenant, insolvency and insolvency proceedings, unlawfulness, litigation and material adverse change, the
occurrence of which, if such event of default is continuing, would allow the Agent (who shall do so if directed
by the majority lenders) to accelerate all or part of the outstanding utilizations and/or terminate the
commitments and/or exercise any of its rights and remedies under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
and other related finance documents.

**_Governing law_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it is governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with German law.

**INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT**

On May 8, 2013, the Issuer, the holders’ representative for our then-outstanding senior secured notes, the
Security Agent, the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and others entered into an
intercreditor agreement (as amended and restated on 24 May 2016 and 9 December 2019 and as further
amended, restated, replaced or otherwise modified or varied from time to time, the “Intercreditor Agreement”)
to govern the relationships and relative priorities among (i) the creditors of the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility (the “Lenders”); (ii) the holders’ representative for our then-outstanding senior secured notes on
behalf of the holders of the then-outstanding senior secured notes; (iii) future hedge counterparties under
certain hedging agreements (the “Hedge Counterparties”); (iv) cash management providers under certain cash


-----

management agreements (the “Cash Management Providers”); (v) certain future creditors of the Group;
(vi) certain intra-group creditors and debtors; (vii) various creditor representatives; and (viii) Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft as the Security Agent. All Guarantors that were not an original party to the Intercreditor
Agreement have subsequently acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides flexibility as to the introduction of certain credit facilities (in addition
to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) which are permitted by the terms of the Pari Passu Debt
Documents (as defined below) to share pari passu in the Collateral with the rights and obligations of Credit
Facility Lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement,
and in respect of which the creditors, facility agent, and arrangers have acceded as Credit Facility Lenders,
Credit Facility Agent or Credit Facility Creditors (as the case may be, and each as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) and which are permitted to receive priority to the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (as defined below)
with respect to the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral (such credit facilities, together with the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, together the “Credit Facilities” and each a “Credit Facility”).

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

- when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of the transaction security;

- the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

- turnover provisions; and

- when security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the transaction security.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to indebtedness incurred by the Debtors that is
permitted by the terms of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes, which is secured by the
Collateral and which ranks pari passu with the Notes and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes in respect of the
enforcement proceeds of the Collateral (such indebtedness together with the Notes and the Existing Fixed
Rate Notes, the “Pari Passu Debt”, the liabilities of the Debtors in respect thereof, the “Pari Passu Debt
**Liabilities”, the creditors thereof, the “Pari Passu Debt Creditors” and all documents or instruments entered**
into between any Debtor (as defined below) and a Pari Passu Debt Creditor setting out the terms of any credit
facility, notes, indenture or debt security which creates or evidences any Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the “Pari
**Passu Debt Documents”), subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement**
allows for a refinancing in full or in part of the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and the Credit Facility Liabilities
(as defined below) as Additional Indebtedness (as defined below).

The Issuer and each of its affiliates that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee under the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, any Credit Facility, the Senior Notes Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents,
any cash management agreements or any hedging documents are together referred to in this description as
“Debtors”.

The Conditions of Issue that will govern the Notes will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without
the consent of the Holders’ Representative, the Security Agent or any Holder, the relevant creditors’
representative and the Security Agent shall enter into certain amendments of the Intercreditor Agreement.
These amendments will provide for adapting the Intercreditor Agreement to a situation where the Existing
Fixed Rate Notes are discharged or redeemed in full. Such scenario will require changes to certain defined
terms in the Intercreditor Agreement which make the Intercreditor Agreement’s inner context dependent on
certain current parties being parties to the Intercreditor Agreement in their current function. The envisaged
amendments will generalize these terms in a way that allows potential then existing parties in connection with
the discharge or redemption of the Existing Fixed Rate Notes (e.g. the then existing new noteholders and
their then existing representative) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement with the same rights and
obligations that the current parties to the Intercreditor Agreement have in their respective functions while
simultaneously preserving the Intercreditor Agreement’s intended inner context. There will be no structural
changes and the amendments will be of technical nature and not adversely affect the Holders in any material
respect.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions that are contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions


-----

relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read the
Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines the rights of the holders of
the Notes.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to the provisions regarding permitted payments and application
of proceeds following an enforcement event as set out below, that the right and priority of payment of all
present and future liabilities and obligations under the Credit Facilities (including all present and future
liabilities and obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facility Liabilities”),
the hedging agreements entered into by the Hedge Counterparties (the “Hedging Liabilities”), the cash
management agreements entered into by the Cash Management Providers (the “Cash Management
**Liabilities”), the Notes (the “Senior Notes Liabilities”) and the Pari Passu Debt rank pari passu in right and**
priority of payment without any preference between them. These liabilities will rank ahead of any liabilities of
the Debtors to any member of the restricted group (the “Intra Group Liabilities”) and any debt owed to a
holding company of the Issuer or a member of the Group that is not a restricted subsidiary (the “Structural
**Liabilities” and, together with the Intra Group Liabilities, the “Subordinated Liabilities”). The Intercreditor**
Agreement does not purport to rank the Subordinated Liabilities among themselves.

**_Transaction Security_**

The Lenders, other creditors of the Credit Facility Liabilities, the priority Hedge Counterparties, the Cash
Management Providers, the holders of the Notes, the Pari Passu Creditors, the creditor representatives, the
arrangers and the Security Agent (together, the “Secured Parties”) benefit from a guarantee and security
package. Subject to the order of application of proceeds (see “—Application of Proceeds” below), the
guarantee and security package shall rank and secure the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities,
the Cash Management Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the arranger
liabilities, the creditor representative liabilities and the liabilities owed to the Security Agent pari passu and
without preference between them. No Secured Party may take the benefit of any guarantee or security from
the Guarantors unless such guarantee or security is also offered (to the extent legally possible) for the benefit
of the other Secured Parties.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the guarantees and transaction security will be released
in certain circumstances described further below in “—Release of Security and Guarantees—Non-distressed
_Disposals” and “—Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals”._

**_Permitted Payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits payments to be made by the Debtors under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and any other documents in respect of Credit Facilities, any Pari Passu Debt Documents
(including the Senior Notes Documents and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes Documents, provided in each case
that such payments are permitted under those documents). The Intercreditor Agreement also does not
prohibit payments to creditors of Intra Group Liabilities, provided that there has been no acceleration event
(other than the placing of any Credit Facility Liabilities or Pari Passu Debt Liabilities on demand) under any
of the Credit Facilities (including the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) or any other Pari Passu Debt
(including the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Notes) (subject to exceptions). No payments may be made
in respect of Structural Liabilities except as permitted by the Credit Facilities (including the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility) and the other Pari Passu Debt Documents (including the Existing Fixed Rate
Notes Documents and the Senior Notes Documents) or if after an acceleration under any of the Credit
Facilities (including the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) or the other Pari Passu Debt (including the
Existing Fixed Rate Notes Documents and the Senior Notes Documents) unless, among other carve-outs, the
required majority of each class of debt has consented. In order to assist enforcement in certain jurisdictions,
the Security Agent holds a parallel claim, in an amount equal to the Secured Liabilities at any time, against the
Debtors. Any payment of the Secured Liabilities reduces the Security Agent’s claim by an equal amount.

There are also restrictions on payments to Hedge Counterparties and Cash Management Providers,
respectively, except certain specified permitted payments.

An acceleration event means the relevant agent exercising any of its rights under the acceleration clause(s)
under the relevant document in respect of a Credit Facility or the relevant creditor representative of any Pari
Passu Debt Creditor exercising any of its rights under the acceleration clause(s) or any acceleration provisions
being automatically invoked under the relevant Pari Passu Debt Document or under the relevant document in
respect of a Credit Facility, respectively.


-----

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

For the purposes of enforcement, the arrangers, the Lenders and their creditor representatives, the Hedge
Counterparties to the extent of the Priority Hedging Liabilities and any Cash Management Providers are
referred to as the “Super Senior Creditors” and the liabilities owed to such Super Senior Creditors (together
with liabilities owed to the Security Agent), the “Super Senior Liabilities”. Up to 40 million (together with any
accrued but unpaid interest on any such amount since the date of termination or the close-out) in aggregate of
Hedging Liabilities may be designated as Priority Hedging Liabilities.

If the transaction security has become enforceable and any of the Super Senior Creditors or the Pari Passu
Creditors (including the holders of the Notes (acting in each case through the relevant creditors’
representative)) wish to enforce the transaction security, either (a) the majority Super Senior Creditors or
(b) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors must give notice of the proposed instructions as to enforcement (the
“Shared Security Notice”) to the Security Agent through its creditor representative. The Security Agent shall,
in turn, provide the Shared Security Notice to each other relevant Creditor Representative. The receipt by the
Security Agent of the Shared Security Notice or (if earlier) a request from a Credit Facility agent to commence
a consultation period following a distress event or any enforcement action triggers a 30-day consultation
period during which time the relevant creditor representatives must consult in good faith with a view to
formulating joint enforcement instructions. During the consultation period, but subject to certain exceptions,
the Secured Parties may not accelerate their respective Liabilities owed to them under the relevant debt
documents nor close-out any hedging transactions.

The “Majority Pari Passu Creditors”means a simple majority of the aggregate of (i) the outstanding principal
amount and commitments of a combined class of holders of the Pari Passu Debt Creditors (including holders
of the Notes) and (ii) the outstanding amount owed by any Debtor to the non-priority hedge counterparties.

A creditor representative is not obliged to consult as described above (or shall only be obliged to consult for a
shorter period) if:

- an insolvency event has occurred and is continuing in relation to a Debtor;

- an event of default is continuing in relation to liabilities owed to the relevant creditor group and that
creditor group (acting in good faith) determines, and notifies the creditor representatives and the Security
Agent, that to do so and thereby delay enforcement could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on (A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the transaction security; or (B) the
realization proceeds available to that creditor group of any enforcement of the transaction security in
any material respect; or

- the creditor representatives and the Security Agent so agree.

**_Conflicting Enforcement Instructions_**

At the end of the consultation period, the Security Agent shall act on the instructions of the Instructing
Group (as defined below). If the Security Agent does not receive any instructions from the Instructing Group
as to enforcement following the consultation period, the Security Agent shall take no action. The Instructing
Group (the “Instructing Group”) consists of (subject to certain provisos, including that set out in the two
paragraphs below) (i) the majority Super Senior Creditors and (ii) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, in each
case acting through their creditor representatives.

If there are conflicting enforcement instructions given to the Security Agent by the different classes of
creditors who can constitute the Instructing Group (or if a creditor representative of a class of creditors fails
to give instructions), then provided that the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have complied with the consultation
obligations in the Intercreditor Agreement and those instructions are consistent with the security enforcement
principles (see further below), the instructions as to enforcement from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors will
prevail over those of the majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu Creditors will constitute
the Instructing Group. If the Majority Pari Passu Creditors fail to give any enforcement instructions during
the consultation period or instruct that shall be no enforcement, the Security Agent will take no enforcement
action.

In the cases above and if the relevant creditor group is the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, if (a) the Security
Agent has not taken any enforcement action within 3 months of the date the first shared security notice was
issued; (b) the Super Senior Creditors have not been repaid in full in cash within 6 months of the date the first
Shared Security Notice was issued; or (c) an insolvency event occurs in respect of a Debtor or the Parent and


-----

the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement, any enforcement instructions given by the majority
Super Senior Creditors will then prevail, provided that they are consistent with the security enforcement
principles.

Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain security enforcement principles which include:

- achieving the security enforcement objective, which is to maximize, so far as is consistent with the prompt
and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the transaction security, the recoveries of the
Super Senior Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors;

- all enforcement proceeds will be received in cash by the Security Agent or sufficient enforcement proceeds
will be received in cash by the Security Agent to ensure that after distribution in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facility Liabilities, Priority Hedging Liabilities, creditor
representative liabilities, arranger liabilities, Security Agent liabilities and Cash Management Liabilities
will be repaid and discharged in full;

- all enforcement action must be prompt and expeditious and reasonably expected to realize proceeds from
enforcement within six months of receipt by the Security Agent of the Shared Security Notice;

- to the extent that the enforcement is in respect of assets (other than shares in a restricted group member)
over which transaction security exists with an aggregate book value exceeding €5,000,000 (or its
equivalent) or in respect of all of the shares in a member of the restricted group which are secured, the
Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group, as applicable) shall obtain an opinion
(for delivery to the Holders’Representative) from a “big four”accounting firm, a recognized independent
investment bank or other reputable independent third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged
in providing valuations of the relevant type and size of assets, as to whether the amount received in
connection with such enforcement is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances (the “Financial Advisor Opinion”);

- the Financial Advisor Opinion will be conclusive evidence as to whether the security enforcement
objective and the security enforcement principles have been met; and

- if the enforcement is by way of public auction, no Financial Advisor Opinion is required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exclusions, if any Lender (or any other Credit Facility creditor), Pari Passu Creditor (other
than a Holder), Hedge Counterparty or Cash Management Provider (or any of their respective creditor
representatives) receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any transaction security or the
proceeds of any demand made in respect of any guarantee liability of any Debtor, except in accordance with
“—Application of Proceeds” below, that person must:

- in relation to amounts not received or recovered by way of set-off, hold that amount (net of third-party
costs and taxes) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that receipt or recovery (net of third-party costs and taxes) to the Security Agent for application
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

There is also a general turnover obligation on the subordinated creditors to turn over to the Security Agent all
amounts which are not permitted payments made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

All amounts from time to time received pursuant to the provisions described under “—Turnover” above or
recovered by the Security Agent in connection with the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the
transaction security or guarantee or otherwise paid to the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any debt document shall be held on trust by the Security Agent and applied at any time as the Security
Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by law, in the following order:

- first, in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any delegate;

- second, pari passu and pro rata, to each creditor representative, including all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with any enforcement;


-----

- third, pari passu and pro rata, in payment to the Credit Facility agent for application towards the discharge
of the Credit Facility Liabilities and the arranger liabilities, the Hedge Counterparties in respect of the
Priority Hedging Liabilities and Cash Management Providers in respect of their Cash Management
Liabilities;

- fourth, pari passu and pro rata, in payment to (i) the respective paying agent on behalf of the holders of
the Notes and other Pari Passu Noteholders for application towards the discharge of the Senior Notes
Liabilities and other Pari Passu Debt Liabilities in accordance with the Senior Notes Documents and
Pari Passu notes conditions of issue, respectively; (ii) the creditor representatives of the Pari Passu Debt
Creditors for application towards the discharge of the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities under Pari Passu facility
agreements; and (iii) the Hedge Counterparties for application towards the discharge of the remaining
Hedging Liabilities;

- fifth, in payment to any person the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor; and

- sixth, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor or other person entitled to it.

**_Option to Purchase_**

Any holders of the Notes, other Pari Passu noteholders and Pari Passu lenders may, after an acceleration
event or an enforcement, and subject to various conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (including
the grant of an acceptable indemnity against clawback to the relevant lenders/creditors), exercise an option to
purchase in full and in cash rights and obligations in relation to the Credit Facility Liabilities, any Pari Passu
Liabilities incurred to refinance relevant Credit Facility Liabilities in full, any Priority Hedging Liabilities and
any Cash Management Liabilities, at par.

**_Release of Security and Guarantees-Non-Distressed Disposals_**

In circumstances where a disposal (i.e. a disposal of an asset by a Debtor which is subject to the transaction
security or a disposal of the shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor (which holding company
is itself a member of the restricted group) which is not otherwise prohibited by the terms of the Credit
Facilities (including the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) and the other Pari Passu Debt Documents
(including the Senior Notes Documents)) is not a distressed disposal, the Intercreditor Agreement provides
that the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed to execute and deliver:

- any release of the transaction security and any other claim (relating to a debt document) over that asset;

- where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a member of the restricted group, any release of the
transaction security and any other claim (relating to a debt document) over that member of the restricted
group’s property and/or the shares in, and assets of, any of its subsidiaries;

- any release of any transaction security and any other claim granted by any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets;

- where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a holding company of a Debtor, any release of the
transaction security and any other claims granted by or over that holding company or any subsidiary of
that holding company over any of its or their assets; and

- any release of the transaction security or any claim described above and issue any certificates of noncrystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may be reasonably requested by the
relevant Debtor,

provided that, inter alia, in the case of a disposal to another member of the restricted group, the release of the
transaction security is permitted under the terms of any Credit Facility, or any Pari Passu Debt Document
and any required replacement security is granted by the transferee before or at the same time as the release if
required by the terms of any Credit Facility or relevant Pari Passu Debt Document. If any proceeds from the
disposal are to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the relevant debt, such proceeds will be so applied and
no consent will be required from any party for that application.


-----

**_Release of Security and Guarantees-Distressed Disposals_**

In circumstances where a distressed disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed:

- to release the transaction security or any other claim over the relevant asset and execute and deliver or
enter into any release of that transaction security, or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of
any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

- if the asset that is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (i) that Debtor and
any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities (other than Super Senior
Liabilities), guarantee liabilities and certain other liabilities; (ii) any transaction security granted over
that Debtor’s assets and the assets of any of its subsidiaries; and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or
intra-Group lender over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor;

- if the asset that is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor, to
release (i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities), guarantee liabilities and certain other
liabilities; (ii) any transaction security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets; and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or intra-group lender over the assets
of any holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company;

- if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of
a Debtor, to dispose of all or any part of that Debtor’s or the holding company that Debtor’s borrowing
liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities), guarantee liabilities, certain other liabilities and other
intra-group liabilities; and

- if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of
a Debtor, to transfer intra-group liabilities and other debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company of a Debtor to another Debtor or member of the restricted group.

Any net proceeds of the disposal must be applied in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall
described under “—Application of Proceeds”.

**_Amendment_**

The Intercreditor Agreement may only be amended with the consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors,
the required percentage of Pari Passu Creditors (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents), the
Issuer and the Security Agent (except for amendments of a minor, technical or administrative nature, which
may be effected by the Security Agent and the Issuer) unless it relates to certain specified matters such as
ranking, priority, turnover, redistribution, enforcement, disposal proceeds, application of enforcement
proceeds and security enforcement principles. Such amendments require consent from all lenders of Credit
Facility Liabilities, any holder of pari passu notes (including holders of the Notes) (in each case acting through
the relevant holders’ representative and in accordance with the relevant conditions of issue), the pari passu
lenders, each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent such amendments would adversely affect it), each Cash
Management Provider (to the extent such amendments would adversely affect it), the Issuer (except for
amendments to the security enforcement principles) and the Security Agent, provided that where an
amendment or waiver only relates to the ranking, order of priority or subordination of, or application of
proceeds or of disposals to, creditors ranking after another group of creditors, the consent of such other
group of creditors shall not be required.

No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or
withdraw or reduce the rights of any party (other than in a way which affects creditors of that party’s class
generally) to the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior consent of that party.

The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended without the consent of the holders of the Notes in certain
circumstances.

To the extent the Debtors wish to enter into Pari Passu Debt or other additional or replacement indebtedness
(“Additional Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited from sharing in the transaction security pursuant to any
Credit Facility document or Pari Passu Debt Document (including the Senior Notes Documents), then the
parties to the Intercreditor Agreement may be required to enter into a replacement intercreditor agreement
on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement provided that such documentation does not
adversely affect the interests of any of the Secured Parties in any material way.


-----

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits the Security Agent to enter into new or supplemental security
and/or release and retake Transaction Security if certain conditions are met.

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are
governed by German law.

**ABS PROGRAM**

We optimize our liquidity by selling a portion of our trade receivables as part of an off-balance asset backed
securities (ABS) program. Based on an agreement we originally entered into with, inter alia, Commerzbank
AG, LBBW and Raiffeisenbank International AG for a 5 year term in 2018, and which we amended and
extended in 2022 with Commerzbank AG, DZ Bank and Raiffeisenbank International AG, we sell our trade
receivables to a special purpose vehicle (named Belvedere Financing) on a non-recourse basis in return for an
immediate cash payment. In order to cover the credit risk, we are paid the nominal amount of the sold
receivables minus a purchase price discount and transaction costs. Trade receivables are sold on a revolving
basis with a maximum aggregate transaction volume of up to €220 million. The ABS Program contains
representations, warranties and covenants typical to asset backed security financing programs, including
representations and warranties as to the eligibility of receivables sold under the ABS Program. As of
September 30, 2023, we had €145.0 million of receivables financed under our ABS Program.

**BILATERAL LOANS**

Our subsidiary Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH has entered into a loan agreement with Volksbank Sauerland. As of
September 30, 2023, Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH owed €61,875 under the loan agreement. The loan agreement is
secured by security over a gas turbine and a biogas plant.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung)
organized under German law (the “Issuer”) will issue €250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of eurodenominated senior secured notes due 2031 (the “Notes”) in accordance with the conditions of issue governing
the Notes (the “Conditions of Issue”), to be dated the Issue Date. In this “Description of the Notes”, the term
“Issuer”refers to Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH only and not to any of its subsidiaries and the term “Parent”
refers to WEPA SE and not to any of its subsidiaries.

The following describes the material provisions of the Notes, the Conditions of Issue, the Guarantee
Agreement, the Security Documents and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and is subject, and is qualified
in its entirety by reference, to all of the provisions of the Notes, the Conditions of Issue, the Guarantee
Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. We urge you to read the Conditions of
Issue, the Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because
they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Conditions of Issue,
the Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available
as set forth under “Listing and General Information”. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this
description under the subheading “—Certain Definitions”.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will be governed by German law and will:

- constitute senior obligations of the Issuer;

- rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations under the Existing Notes, the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities;

- be secured by the Collateral (as defined below) along with obligations under the Existing Notes, the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities
(but will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral only after all obligations secured on a
super priority basis, including obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority
Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities, have been paid in full);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

- rank effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the Issuer,
to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations of the Issuer under
the Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s existing and future secured Indebtedness that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property or assets
securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors (as defined below).

**_The Note Guarantees_**

From the Issue Date, the Notes will initially be guaranteed on a senior basis by each Restricted Subsidiary of
the Issuer which guarantees the Existing Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (the “Initial
**Note Guarantees”). From the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by Wepa Italia S.r.l., Wepa France**
S.A.S., Wepa Professional GmbH, Wepa Greenfield S.A.S., Wepa UK Ltd, Wepa Piechowice Sp. z o.o., Wepa
Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Wepa Kraftwerk GmbH and Wepa Reserve GmbH (each an “Initial
**Guarantor” and such entities collectively the “Initial Guarantors”).**

The Issuer may from time to time be required to procure from certain of its Subsidiaries (each, an “Additional
**Guarantor”, and collectively with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”) the issuance of additional**
guarantees pursuant to the provisions set forth under “—Covenants—Future Guarantors” below.

Any such guarantee (an “Additional Note Guarantee” and, together with the Initial Note Guarantees, the
“Note Guarantees”) shall be issued on substantially the same terms as the Initial Note Guarantees and be
subject to limitations and restrictions as set forth under “—Covenants—Future Guarantors”. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations_


-----

on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity
and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

The Guarantors will, jointly and severally, guarantee by way of an independent payment obligation
(selbständiges Zahlungsversprechen) unconditionally and irrevocably, on (subject to the limitations set out
below) a senior basis, the full and punctual payment of all amounts payable under the Notes when due. The
Note Guarantees will be agreed in a separate agreement to be entered into on or prior to the Issue Date
among Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, as Security Agent, and each Initial Guarantor (the “Guarantee
**Agreement”). The Note Guarantees will not constitute contracts for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or**
the Holders’ Representative (as defined below) from time to time as third party beneficiaries in accordance
with Section 328(1) of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) and will not give rise to the right of
each holder of any Notes or the Holders’ Representative to require performance of the Note Guarantees
directly from the Guarantors and to enforce the Note Guarantees directly against the Guarantors. A copy of
the Guarantee Agreement may be inspected and obtained free of charge at the principal office of the Paying
Agent during normal business hours.

The term “Note Guarantees” shall also include any such Additional Note Guarantees and the term
“Guarantors” shall also include any such Additional Guarantors.

The obligations under the Note Guarantees issued by Guarantors will be limited as necessary under the terms
of such Note Guarantees to prevent the Note Guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under
applicable laws, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable laws, including with respect to maintenance
of share capital and other applicable statutory provisions. The Note Guarantees may be subject to claims that
they should be subordinated or voided in favor of our existing and future creditors under capital maintenance
and other laws in Germany and other relevant jurisdictions.

Subject to the above, the Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- constitute direct, unconditional and irrevocable senior obligations of such Guarantor;

rank at least equal in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future obligations
that are not subordinated in right of payment to the relevant Note Guarantee, including obligations
under the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations
and Cash Management Liabilities;

- be secured by the Collateral along with its obligations under the Existing Notes, the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities (but will
receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral only after all obligations secured on a super
priority basis, including its obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority
Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities, have been paid in full);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the relevant
Guarantor;

- effectively rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the relevant
Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations of the
relevant Guarantor under the applicable Note Guarantee;

- effectively rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligations of the relevant Guarantor
secured on the Collateral on a basis junior to the Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is
available to satisfy the obligations under the applicable Note Guarantee;

- be subject to limitations, risks and qualifications described herein and in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”;_

- be effectively subordinated to such Guarantor’s existing and future secured Indebtedness that is secured
by property or assets that do not secure the Guarantee of such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of
such property or assets securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness (including obligations to trade
creditors) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

As of the Issue Date, not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes and we may establish further
Subsidiaries in the future that will not guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the


-----

holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Issuer or any Guarantor. During the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Issuer and the
Guarantors generated 96.9% of our consolidated revenues (effects of intra-group transactions eliminated)
and 96.4% of our EBITDA (effects of intra-group transactions eliminated) and as of September 30, 2023,
held 95.4% of our consolidated total assets (effects of intra-group relations eliminated). The operations of the
Issuer are conducted, to a significant extent, through its Subsidiaries and, therefore the Issuer depends on the
cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Notes will
be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. See “Risks
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the_
_liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.”_

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may, without the consent of the relevant Holders, issue additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”)
under the Conditions of Issue from time to time after this offering having the same terms and conditions as
the Notes in all respects (or in all respects except for the issue date, the commencement of interest payment
obligations and/or the issue price). Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the
Conditions of Issue including the covenant described below under “—Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”. The Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Conditions of Issue will be consolidated_
with, form a single series with and increase the aggregate principal amount of the Notes; provided, however,
that such relevant Additional Notes that are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes
shall have a separate common code, ISIN or other identifying number different from the Notes. Unless the
context requires otherwise, references in this “Description of the Notes” to the Notes include the Notes and
any Additional Notes that are issued.

**_Principal and Maturity_**

The Issuer will issue €250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Notes will mature
on January 15, 2031 (the “Maturity Date”) at their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the Maturity Date. The Notes will be issued in denominations of €1,000,
which will be transferable only in minimum aggregate principal amounts of €100,000 and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the Notes will accrue on their outstanding aggregate principal amount at the rate of % per
annum from and including the Issue Date to but excluding the Maturity Date and will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year commencing on July 15, 2024. The Notes
shall cease to bear interest at the end of the day immediately preceding the relevant due date for repayment.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from
the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months. If interest is to be calculated for a period of less than one year (a “Calculation Period”)
it shall be calculated on the basis of the Day Count Fraction. “Day Count Fraction” means with regard to the
calculation of interest on any Note for any Calculation Period the number of days in the Calculation Period
divided by 360, the number of days to be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days with twelve 30day months.

A Default shall occur, irrespective of any notice, if any amounts payable under the Notes are not paid when
due. Any due and unpaid amount of principal shall, irrespective of any notice and for so long as such Default
remains outstanding, bear additional default interest at a rate equal to 1% per annum from and including the
relevant due date to but excluding the date of payment.

The rights of Holders of the Notes to receive the payments of interest on the Notes will be subject to the
relevant procedures of Clearstream Banking AG, Frankfurt am Main (“Clearstream Banking”). If a particular
interest payment date is not a Business Day, then the payment date will move to the next Business Day, and
the Holders will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Methods of receiving payments on the Notes_**

Payments of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes will be made to
the Paying Agent for on-payment to the clearing system or to its order for credit to the respective account
holders of the clearing system and, in case of principal, upon presentation and surrender of the Global Notes.


-----

See “—Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”. Payments to the clearing system or to its order shall to the extent of
amounts so paid constitute the discharge of the Issuer from its corresponding liabilities under the Notes. No
service charge will be payable for any registration of transfer or redemption of Notes, but the Issuer may
require payment in certain circumstances of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.

**_Book-entry; Delivery and Form_**

The Notes will be represented by two global notes in bearer form without interest coupons, one of which shall
represent Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the
Securities Act) (such global notes, the “144A Global Notes”) and the other of which shall represent Notes sold
outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons as defined in, and in reliance on, Regulation S
under the Securities Act (such global notes, the “Reg S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global
Notes, the “Global Notes”). Definitive notes representing individual Notes and interest coupons shall not be
issued. The Global Notes will be deposited with Clearstream Banking. Ownership of interests in the Global
Notes, referred to as “book-entry interests”, will be limited to persons that have accounts with Clearstream
Banking (such persons, “participants”) or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Bookentry interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Clearstream Banking and its participants.

Ownership of interests in the book-entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
**Restrictions”. Book-entry interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be**
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form obtainable from the Transfer Agent) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

The Notes represented by the 144A Global Note may be exchanged for Notes represented by the Reg S Global
Note and vice versa, except that no such exchange can be effected in the period starting five Business Days
prior to any payment of principal, interest or any other amount falling due under these Conditions of Issue
until (and including) the actual date of such payment

Any book-entry interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
book-entry interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer,
it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

**_Security; Release of Collateral_**

The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will
be secured by Liens (subject to any Permitted Collateral Liens, applicable perfection requirements and
exceptions and limitations described herein) over the collateral set out below (collectively, the “Collateral”):

(a) all the shares of or the partnership interests in the Issuer, each Guarantor (other than Wepa Italia
S.r.l.) and Wepa Deutschland Verwaltungs- GmbH;

(b) all existing and future loans held by the Parent against the Issuer;

(c) certain machinery and equipment of the Issuer, Wepa Professional GmbH and Wepa Deutschland
GmbH & Co. KG;

(d) certain real property in Germany; and

(e) certain machinery and equipment of Wepa UK Ltd.

The Notes are intended to benefit from the same Liens over the Collateral as the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and the Existing Notes. In order to address any potential legal uncertainty in certain
jurisdictions on this point with regard to certain Liens, however, we will enter into separate confirmation
agreements and/or amendment agreements with regard to such Liens on or before the Issue Date. In addition,
we will create supplemental and/or additional junior ranking Liens over certain assets of the Issuer and the
Guarantors that form part of the Collateral in certain jurisdictions. Such additional Liens will secure all the
Notes. In certain jurisdictions, such supplemental and/or additional liens over the Collateral, because they are


-----

being granted at a later point in time, will rank junior in rem to security interests in the Collateral granted in
favor of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Notes. However, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the benefit of the first and junior ranking Liens over the Collateral shall be shared
equally among the Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
Finance Parties, the creditors of the Priority Hedging Obligations and the creditors of the Cash Management
Liabilities, provided that any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities that are secured by assets that also
secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Guarantors’ obligations under Note Guarantees will
receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets, and
further provided that, after giving effect to such priority, the Holders will receive pro rata and pari passu share
of the remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets with the creditors of the
Pari Passu Debt Liabilities.

In determining whether and what additional collateral and guarantees may be provided, the Agreed Security
Principles as set forth in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be taken into account, including the
following:

- all guarantees and security granted may have to be limited to the extent advised by local counsel and tax
advisers as being necessary to comply with local legal requirements and recommended tax structuring;

- general statutory limitations, capital maintenance rules, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules (or analogous restrictions), retention of title claims and similar
principles may limit the ability of a Guarantor to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the
guarantee be limited by an amount or otherwise, provided that the Issuer will use reasonable endeavors
to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to the relevant Guarantor;

- the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account the cost to the group and/or
security providers of providing security and the proportionate benefit accruing to the beneficiaries of
that security; in determining whether or not security shall be taken or perfected due regard shall be made
to the applicable cost and a cost/benefit analysis, which shall include that no costs must be incurred which
is materially disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that security;

- in the case of any joint venture or non-wholly-owned Subsidiary, the joint venture agreement or any
other agreement or the law generally may contain restrictions on providing guarantees or security;

- any assets subject to third-party arrangements which are permitted by the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, the conditions of issue for the Existing Notes and the Conditions of Issue and which prevent
those assets from being charged will be excluded from the taking of security in any relevant security
document provided that all reasonable endeavors to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be
used by the relevant Guarantor if the relevant asset is material;

- Guarantors will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if that would conflict
with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal prohibition or result in a risk of
personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer provided that the relevant company shall use all
reasonable endeavors to overcome any such obstacle;

- perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable
and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Finance Documents (as defined in the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility) therefor or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified
in the Finance Documents (as defined in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility)) within the time
periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection;

- the maximum granted or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization,
registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the granted or
secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes and duties;

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be
granted over the material assets only;

- the costs of granting real estate security must not be excessive and the amount secured by each security
over real estate may be restricted to an agreed level; and

- local law restrictions may mean that the Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
may not be able to benefit from the same security.


-----

The share pledges and the interest pledges indicated above will be established pursuant to the Security
Documents with the Security Agent acting for the benefit of the Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes
and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Finance Parties. The other Collateral will be established
pursuant to the Security Documents with the Security Agent acting for the benefit of the Holders, the holders
of the Existing Notes and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Finance Parties being the legal holder of
the security interests in the Collateral. Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can
only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions which, in the case of some
Collateral, will not be completed until after the Issue Date.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, if machinery, other equipment or real property located in Germany,
which individually is worth €5 million or more, is acquired by the Issuer or any Guarantor that is not
automatically subject to a perfected security interest under the Security Documents, then the Issuer or such
Guarantor will, if the Security Agent reasonably specifies, within three months, with respect to acquired
machinery or other equipment, and within six months, with respect to acquired real property, provide security
(in such form as the Security Agent may reasonably require) over such assets or property in favor of the
Security Agent (or its nominee(s)) for the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Finance Parties. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, security shall be granted over any newly acquired real property located
in Germany if any paper machine is constructed or installed as essential component (wesentlicher Bestandteil)
on such real property, provided that the aggregate value of such real property and paper machine is €5 million
or more. Subject to the provisions of the covenant “—Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, the Issuer or such
Guarantor will be required to provide any such security contemporaneously also to the Holders on an equal
and rateable basis. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, no security shall be granted in favor of the
Security Agent or the Holders over after-acquired machinery, equipment or real property which (in accordance
with the Conditions of Issue, Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and Intercreditor Agreement) are subject
to a Permitted Lien which secures Indebtedness Incurred in connection with the financing of the acquisition
or development of such machinery, equipment or real property.

The Security Agent will (i) release the Liens over the shares, property and other assets constituting Collateral
in accordance with the terms provided therefor in the Conditions of Issue, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) at the request of the Issuer, a Guarantor or another security provider upon
having received an Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel certifying compliance with this
paragraph, release the relevant Collateral or execute such other appropriate instrument evidencing such release
(in the form provided by and at the expense of the Issuer or the relevant security provider) under one or more
of the following circumstances (without any such release requiring the consent of the Holders’ Representative
or the Holders):

(a) in connection with any sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such
property or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition does not violate the provisions described under “—Covenants—Limitation on Sales
_of Assets” below and is otherwise in compliance with the Conditions of Issue;_

(b) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Conditions of Issue, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor which
was part of the Collateral;

(c) if the Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary as
permitted under and in compliance with the Conditions of Issue, the release of the property, assets
and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(d) upon redemption of all the Notes;

(e) in connection with an enforcement action taken by certain secured creditors of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) as provided for under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(g) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under “—Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation”;_

(h) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance as provided below under “—Legal Defeasance or
_Covenant Defeasance”;_


-----

(i) with respect to any property or assets that become Collateral securing the Notes and/or any Note
Guarantee pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the covenant “—Limitation on Liens”, upon the release and
discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of the Initial Lien, to the extent that such
Lien does not secure any other Indebtedness on a pari passu basis in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(j) with respect to any Collateral consisting of the type of assets listed under clause (e) of the definition
of “Collateral”set out above, upon, and at the same time as, the release and discharge (other than as
a result of an enforcement action) of any and all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) over such
Collateral securing any Indebtedness, so long as no Event of Default exists at such time or would
arise as a result of such release; or

(k) as provided for in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Security Agent shall be entitled to accept such Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as
sufficient evidence of compliance with this paragraph, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the
Holders.

The Security Agent will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the
Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions of Issue, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders
or any action on the part of the Holders’ Representative.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Finance Parties, the holders’ representative in respect of the
Existing Notes (in its own name and on behalf of the holders of the Existing Notes) and the Holders’
Representative, in its own name and on behalf of the Holders, appointed Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft,
as Security Agent, to act as their agent and security trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents and irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to:

(a) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to them
under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions;

(b) execute each Security Document on their behalf and any waiver, modification, amendment, renewal
or replacement permitted by and in accordance with the Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(c) administer and enforce any security interest with respect to any Collateral, subject to the terms and
conditions and limitations contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors under their respective financing
arrangements, including without limitation, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes,
the Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Liabilities, will be governed by the
Intercreditor Agreement entered into on May 8, 2013, as amended and restated from time to time, between,
among others, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Finance Parties and the
Security Agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations
under, among others, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (and certain other Credit Facilities that may
be entitled to super priority status as described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement”). Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities that are secured by assets that_
also secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Note
Guarantees will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any
such assets. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral, after all obligations
under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (and certain other Credit Facilities that may be entitled to
super priority status as described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”,
Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities, as well as all obligations owing to the Security
Agent, any receiver or delegate, the agent under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (and any other
Credit Facilities that may be entitled to super priority status as described under “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”), the Holders’ Representative and the arrangers under the Super_
Senior Revolving Credit Facility have been repaid from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in repayment


-----

of all obligations under the Conditions of Issue and the Notes and any other Pari Passu Debt Liabilities of
the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the
Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor Agreement. For further details, see under “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”._

**Release of Note Guarantees**

A Note Guarantee shall be released and discharged, automatically, unconditionally and without further action
on the part of the Security Agent:

(a) in the case of a Note Guarantee of a Guarantor, in the event of any sale, exchange, assignment,
transfer conveyance or other disposition (including by merger or otherwise) (i) of the Capital Stock
of a Guarantor, after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) of
all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after
giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each of sub-clauses (i) and
(ii) of this clause (a), which sale, exchange, assignment, transfer conveyance or other disposition is
permitted under, and made in compliance with, the Conditions of Issue;

(b) upon the release of the Guarantee of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the relevant Note
Guarantee under the covenant described below under “—Covenants—Future Guarantors”so long as
no Event of Default would arise as a result and no other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Guarantor at that time is Guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor;

(c) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance as provided below under “—Legal Defeasance or
_Covenant Defeasance”;_

(d) upon redemption of all the Notes;

(e) if the Issuer designates a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary as permitted under and in
compliance with the Conditions of Issue;

(f) in accordance with the provisions of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(g) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under “—Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation”;_

(h) as provided for under “—Amendments and Waivers”; or

(i) as provided for in the Note Guarantees.

No release and discharge of a Note Guarantee pursuant to clauses (b) and (e) above shall be effective (i) if a
Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Conditions of Issue as of the time of
such proposed release and discharge until such time as such Default or Event of Default is cured or waived
and (ii) if so requested by the Security Agent, until the Issuer shall have delivered to the Security Agent (x) an
Officers’ Request Certificate and (y) Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent set forth
in the Conditions of Issue have been fulfilled and that such release and discharge is authorized and permitted
pursuant to such Conditions of Issue. The Security Agent shall be entitled to accept such Officer’s Request
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of such conditions precedent, in
which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Note Guarantee, as specified above, the Security Agent,
subject to receipt of certain documents from the Issuer or a Guarantor, will take all necessary action and
execute any documents, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably required in order to evidence such release, discharge and
termination in respect of any Note Guarantee to be released as described above. Neither the Issuer nor any
Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or
termination.

**Restricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be “Restricted Subsidiaries”. However, under the
circumstances described below under “—Covenants—Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”, the Issuer
will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Conditions of Issue and will not guarantee the
Notes.


-----

**Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Holders’ Representative**

The Issuer will maintain for the Notes a Paying Agent (the “Paying Agent”), a Transfer Agent (the “Transfer
**Agent”) and a Notification Agent (“Notification Agent”) for communication by the Holders’ Representative.**
The initial Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Notification Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG.

The Issuer may appoint additional paying agents and transfer agents and revoke the appointment of any
paying agent or transfer agent; provided, however, that (i) for as long as the Notes are listed on a stock
exchange, the Issuer shall at all times ensure that a paying agent is appointed in the jurisdiction in which such
stock exchange is located, if so required by the rules of such stock exchange and (ii) in no event may the Issuer
act as Paying Agent or appoint a Paying Agent in any member state of the European Union where the Paying
Agent would be obliged to withhold or deduct tax in connection with any payment made by it in relation to
the Notes unless the Paying Agent would be so obliged if it were located in all other member states. Any such
appointment or revocation shall be published without undue delay in accordance with the provisions set forth
under “—Notices”.

The Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent reserve the right at any time to change their specified offices. Any
such change shall be published without undue delay in accordance with procedures set forth under
“—Notices”.

The common representative (the “Holders’ Representative”) to exercise the Holders’ rights on behalf of the
Holders of the Notes as provided for in the Conditions of Issue will be Deloitte GmbH
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Attn: Philipp von Websky and Katharina Schlinghoff, Erna-Scheffler-Str.
2, 40476 Düsseldorf, Germany. The Holders’ Representative has the duties and powers provided for in the
Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement, by law or granted by resolution of the Holders. The
Holders’ Representative shall comply with the instructions of the Holders. To the extent that the Holders’
Representative has been authorized to assert certain rights of the Holders, the Holders shall not be entitled to
assert such rights themselves, unless explicitly provided for in the relevant resolution or the Conditions of
Issue. The Holders’ Representative shall provide reports to the Holders on its activities. The provisions of the
German Act on Debt Securities of 2009 (Gesetz über Schuldverschreibungen aus Gesamtemissionen
_(Schuldverschreibungsgesetz—SchVG), “SchVG”) apply with regard to the removal of the Holders’_
Representative and its rights and obligations. Notwithstanding the next paragraph below, if the Holders
choose to remove their Holders’ Representative or if the Holders’ Representative resigns and the Holders fail
to appoint a successor Holders’ Representative, the exercise of certain rights under the Conditions of Issue
may require a meeting of the Holders and may be significantly more difficult to exercise.

The Holders’ Representative may be removed from office at any time by majority resolution of the Holders of
the Notes without specifying any reasons; provided that the Holders shall only so remove the Holders’
Representative for the Notes if, at the same time, a successor Holders’ Representative for the Notes is elected
by such majority resolution of the Holders of the Notes. The Holders’ Representative may resign at any time
by notifying the Issuer (in which case the Issuer shall notify the Holders in accordance with the notice
provisions). If the Holders’ Representative resigns, it shall call a vote without undue delay to elect a successor
Holders’ Representative. Any successor Holders’ Representative shall also succeed the retiring Holders’
Representative as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders’ Representative will be liable for the proper performance of its duties towards the Holders the
Notes who will be joint and several creditors (Gesamtgläubiger); in the performance of its duties it shall act
with the diligence and care of a prudent business manager (ordentlicher und gewissenhafter Geschäftsleiter
within the meaning of Section 7(3) SchVG). The total liability of the Holders’ Representative to all Holders
will be limited to €5,000,000 (or, if higher, an amount equal to ten times the Holders’ Representative’s
aggregate annual compensation for its services as common representative of the Holders) in the aggregate,
unless the Holders’ Representative’s liability has been caused by its gross negligence (grobe Fahrlässigkeit) or
wilful misconduct (Vorsatz) (in which case its liability shall be unlimited). The responsibilities and liability of
the Holders’ Representative is further limited as specified in the Conditions of Issue and may be further
limited by a resolution passed by Holders.

The Holders’ Representative shall not under any circumstances be liable for any consequential loss. The
Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to retain third party advisors if such appointment is, in its sole
reasonable discretion, required in, or for the performance of, its duties and the Issuer will bear such costs. The
Holders’ Representative shall only be responsible for the proper selection of such third-party advisor
(Auswahlverschulden), but shall otherwise be entitled to rely fully on the advice rendered by such third party
advisor. In particular, the Holders’ Representative is not responsible for the selection of the Security Agent
and will have no responsibility towards the Holders or any other party for the validity, perfection, sufficiency,


-----

adequacy, insuring of, priority or enforceability of any Note Guarantee, Collateral, Intercreditor Agreement
or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, regardless of whether entered in before or after the Issue Date.

The Holders’ Representative may demand from the Issuer to furnish all information required for the
performance of the duties entrusted to it.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer or, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Note Guarantee, any
present or future Guarantor or any successor of any of the foregoing (each a “Payor”) under or with respect
to the Notes or any Note Guarantee shall be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for
or on account of any Taxes, unless the deduction or withholding of such Taxes is required by law. If any
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed by or on behalf of or levied within (i) the
Federal Republic of Germany, (ii) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or a Note
Guarantee is made, (iii) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be
resident or conducts business for tax purposes or any (iv) province, municipality or other political subdivision
or taxing authority in or of any such jurisdiction under foregoing (i) through (iii) (any such jurisdiction under
foregoing (i) through (iv) a “Relevant Tax Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required to be made from any
payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect to the Notes or any
Note Guarantee, the relevant Payor shall pay (together with such payment) such additional amounts as may
be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the Notes after such withholding or
deduction (including any deduction or withholding from such additional amounts) shall equal the respective
amounts of principal and interest that would have been receivable in respect of the relevant Notes, in the
absence of such deduction or withholding (the aggregate of such additional amounts, “Additional Amounts”),
except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the Holder or
beneficial owner of a Note (or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial
owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) having, or
having had, some personal or business connection with the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (other than
the mere acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of such Note, the enforcement of rights
under such Note or under a Note Guarantee, or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note
or Note Guarantee) and not merely by reason of the fact that payments in respect of the Notes or
any Note Guarantee are, or for purposes of taxation are deemed to be, derived from sources in, or
are secured in, the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction;

(b) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(c) any Taxes imposed on a payment on a Note presented for payment (where presentation is required
for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by
presenting the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(d) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(e) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the failure of the
Holder, following the Issuer’s written request addressed to the Holder (and made at a time that
would enable the Holder acting reasonably to comply with that request, and in all events, at least
60 days before any such withholding or deduction would be required), to comply with any
certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition
to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder is not
resident in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the Holder is legally
entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(f) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed under section 1471 through
1474 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as of the date of this offering
memorandum (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not
materially more onerous to comply with), including any current or future Treasury regulations or
other official interpretations thereunder or any law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental
agreement between a non-U.S. government and the United States with respect to the foregoing;


-----

(g) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed on or with respect to any
payments under, or with respect to, the Notes or under or with respect to any Note Guarantee by
reason of the Holder being, or having been a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the
sole beneficial owner of any such payments to the extent that such Taxes would not have been
imposed or required to be withheld or deducted on such payments had such Holder been the sole
beneficial owner of such Notes; or

(h) any combination of items (a) through (g) above.

In cases where the deduction or withholding of Taxes on or with respect to any payments under or with
respect to the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee is required by law to be made by a Payor, the Payor
will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld
to the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to
obtain tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will furnish to a Holder upon written request, within a reasonable time
after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing payment by the Payor, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not
obtained, other reasonably satisfactory evidence of payments by the Payor.

If the Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment,
at least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note
Guarantee is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day
prior to such date, in which case it must be delivered promptly thereafter), the Payor will deliver to the Paying
Agent an Officers’ Request Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts
estimated to be payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to inform the
relevant Holders of the payment of such Additional Amounts in accordance with the procedures set forth in
“—Notices” on the payment date.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including penalties, interest and other
liabilities related thereto) which arise from the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of the Notes or any
Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes),
or the receipt of any payments with respect to, or enforcement of, the Notes or any Note Guarantee.

Whenever in the Conditions of Issue or in this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context,
the payment or non-payment of principal, premium or interest, if any, or any other amount payable under or
with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment
of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable
in respect thereof.

The above obligation will survive any termination or defeasance of the Conditions of Issue, any transfer by a
Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any
successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized or otherwise considered to be resident or
conducts business for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on the Notes or
any Note Guarantee is made and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any Guarantors
under or in connection with the Notes. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro (the
“Required Currency”), which is made to or for the account of any Holder in lawful currency of any other
jurisdiction (the “Judgment Currency”), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement
thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer’s or the
Guarantor’s obligation under the Conditions of Issue and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as the case may be,
only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency with such Holder, as the case may be, could
purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance
with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt
of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased
is less than the amount of the Required Currency originally due to such Holder, as the case may be, the Issuer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising
out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent
from the other obligations contained in the Conditions of Issue and shall give rise to a separate and


-----

independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder from time to
time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in
respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to January 15, 2027, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the
original principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional Notes)
with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of % of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the
applicable redemption date (subject to the rights of Holders to receive interest on the relevant interest payment
date); provided, however, that:

(i) at least 65% of the original principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to any
issuance of additional Notes) remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(ii) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice.

At any time prior to January 15, 2027, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date (subject to the rights of Holders
to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date).

Except pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs and except pursuant to “—Early Redemption for Taxation
_Reasons”, the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s option prior to January 15, 2027._

At any time on or after January 15, 2027, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of
the Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as
a percentage of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning
on January 15 of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive interest on the
relevant interest payment date:

2027 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2028 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %
2029 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If the due date for any redemption
payment in respect of the Note is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding day that
is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

**Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers**

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Conditions of Issue, in connection with any tender offer for, or
other offer to purchase or invitation to offer to purchase, the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer (as
defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below) (each, a “Tender Offer”), if Holders of not less
than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender (or offer to purchase)
and do not validly withdraw (or revoke their offer to purchase) such Notes in such Tender Offer and the
Issuer, or any third party making such Tender Offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of such Notes validly
tendered (or offered to purchase) and not validly withdrawn (or such offer to purchase not having been validly
revoked) by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’notice, given not more than 30 days following the expiration date of the relevant Tender Offer, to
redeem all remaining Notes at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder (excluding any early tender
premium, incentive fee or similar payment) in such Tender Offer, plus, to the extent not included in the Tender
Offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to but excluding the
applicable redemption date.

**Early Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

If (i) the Issuer becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts as set forth under “—Payment of Additional
_Amounts” above, (ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the taking of reasonable measures available to the_
Issuer and (iii) the requirement arises as a result of:


-----

(a) any change in or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before, and which becomes effective on or after, the Issue Date or,
if a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction has changed since the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction became an applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction pursuant to the Conditions of Issue
(the “Relevant Tax Jurisdiction Date”); or

(b) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official
position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations
or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change
in published practice), which change, amendment, application or interpretation has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before, and becomes effective on or after, the Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction Date,

the Notes may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the option of the Issuer, upon not less than 10 days’
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice of redemption at 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax
**Redemption Date”) and Additional Amounts, if any, then due and that will become due on the Tax**
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of Holders to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof).

Prior to giving any notice of redemption pursuant to this provision, the Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’
Representative for delivery to the Holders in accordance with “—Notices” (i) an Officers’ Request Certificate
stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that
the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have occurred and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel
qualified under the laws of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction to the effect that there has been such change or
amendment which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. The Holders’ Representative shall
be entitled to accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of such conditions
precedent, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

No notice of redemption pursuant to this provision may be given (i) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest
date on which the Issuer would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of the
Notes then due, or (ii) if at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts does
not remain in effect.

**Procedures of Redemption**

Any notice of redemption shall be given in accordance with the procedures set forth in “—Notices”. It shall be
irrevocable, must specify the amount of redemption, the terms and date fixed for redemption and must set
forth a statement in summary form of the facts constituting the basis for the right of the Issuer so to redeem
the Notes.

In the case of a partial redemption of the Notes, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in accordance with
the rules of the relevant clearing system. Such partial redemption shall be reflected in the records of
Clearstream Banking as either a pool factor or a reduction in aggregate principal amount.

The Issuer may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market
purchase, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable laws, as long as such transaction
does not otherwise violate the Conditions of Issue.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder shall have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any
part (equal to €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to but excluding the applicable purchase date (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”), subject to the
rights of Holders of Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date.

No later than 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer shall give notice in accordance with the
procedures set forth in “—Notices” below, with a copy to the Holders’ Representative, stating:


-----

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that each Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at the Change of Control Purchase Price (the “Change of
**Control Payment”);**

(b) the repurchase date (the repurchase date so stated the “Change of Control Payment Date”), which
date shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is given;

(c) the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Conditions of Issue, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased;

(d) that, if such notice is given prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control;

(e) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

(f) that any Note accepted for Change of Control Payment will cease to accrue interest after the Change
of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; and

(g) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest (the offer so being made
the “Change of Control Offer”).

The Issuer shall not be required to make the Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a third
party makes an offer in a manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in
the Conditions of Issue applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption has
been given pursuant to the Conditions of Issue as described above under “—Optional Redemption”, unless
and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the
Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer or any offer made in lieu
thereof in accordance with the procedures set forth in “—Notices” on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Payment Date.

Except as otherwise set forth under this heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of
_Control”, the Conditions of Issue do not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer_
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction that may
adversely affect the Holders if such transaction does not constitute a Change of Control. The Change of
Control provisions described under this heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of
_Control” may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving the Issuer by_
increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection
with the repurchase of Notes. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with provisions of the Conditions of Issue, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions
of the Conditions of Issue by virtue of the conflict.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable German law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a
result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will have sufficient funds or
other resources to pay the Change of Control Payment for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders
thereof seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We
_may not be able to repay the Notes when due or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to_
_certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the_
_Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events”._

**Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Guarantor may
Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if (i) on the date thereof and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, and (y) to the extent such
Indebtedness is purported to be secured by a Lien, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would be no greater than 3.75 to 1.00 and (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing or would occur as a consequence of Incurring the Indebtedness.

The foregoing paragraph shall not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(i) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with a Credit
Facility (including under ancillary facilities made available under such Credit Facility) in an
aggregate principal amount not to exceed (A) €150 million plus (B) in the case of any refinancing
of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (i) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount
of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection
with such refinancing;

(ii) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that

(A) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is not the
Issuer or a Guarantor (except in case of intercompany liabilities Incurred in the ordinary
course of business in connection with cash pooling or cash management or tax positions of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), such Indebtedness must be unsecured and to the
extent legally permitted (the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all
procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors of the obligee or obligor to
protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the
subordination of such Indebtedness) expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in
cash of all obligations then due with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the
relevant Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and

(B) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock that results in any such Indebtedness
being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and (y) any sale or
other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is neither the Issuer nor a Restricted
Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this
clause (ii);

(iii) any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (iv), (v), or (x) or this
clause (iii);

(iv) Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date after giving effect to the use of proceeds of the Notes
(other than any Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Facility permitted under clause (i) above
or any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (ii), (vi) or (vii));

(v) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer and the Guarantors represented by the Notes to be issued on
the Issue Date, the Note Guarantees in respect of these Notes and any “parallel debt” obligations
under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents;

(vi) Indebtedness under Hedging Obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is
Incurred in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes;

(vii) Indebtedness Incurred under a Guarantee by any Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be Incurred
by another provision of this covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; provided, however, that if
the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Note
Guarantee, then the Guarantee must be subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same
extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;


-----

(viii) Indebtedness Incurred after the Issue Date in respect of workers’ compensation claims, early
retirement obligations, or social security or wage taxes in the ordinary course of business;

(ix) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary represented by Capitalized Lease
Obligations, Purchase Money Obligations or other Indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection
with the acquisition or development of real or personal, movable or immovable, property or other
assets (including Capital Stock), in each case incurred for the purpose of financing or refinancing
all or any part of the purchase price, lease expense, rental payments (other than lease payments or
rental expenses under a capitalized lease for reporting purposes under GAAP) or cost of design,
installation, construction or improvement of property used in the business of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate principal amount pursuant to this clause (ix), including any
Refinancing Indebtedness that refinances such Indebtedness, not to exceed the greater of
(x) €70 million and (y) 6.5% of Total Assets at any time outstanding; provided that the principal
amount of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (ix) did not in each case at the time of
incurrence exceed the Fair Market Value of the acquired or constructed asset or improvement so
financed;

(x) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such
Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by, or merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise
combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related
liabilities), the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness Incurred (a) to provide
all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate any of the aforementioned transactions or
series of related transactions or (b) otherwise in connection with, or in contemplation of, such
transaction or series of related transactions); provided, however, that at the time such Restricted
Subsidiary is acquired (or other transaction is made) by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary,
(A) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
clause (i)(x) of the first paragraph of this covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness”or (B) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer would not be less than it was immediately prior to such
acquisition or other transaction, in each case after giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of
such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (x);

(xi) Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of (a) letters of credit, surety,
performance or appeal bonds, completion guarantees, judgment, advance payment, customs, VAT
or other tax guarantees or similar instruments issued in the ordinary course of business of such
Person and not in connection with the borrowing of money, including letters of credit or similar
instruments in respect of self-insurance and workers compensation obligations, (b) the financing
of insurance premiums in the ordinary course of business, (c) the honoring by a bank or other
financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the
ordinary course of business, (d) inventory financing or any guarantees thereof and (e) any
customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting-off arrangements (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any Cash Management Liabilities) entered into in the ordinary course of
business (as determined in good faith by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); provided, however, that,
in relation to the foregoing sub-clauses (a) through (d), upon the drawing (Inanspruchnahme) of
such letters of credit or other instrument, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following
such drawing (Inanspruchnahme);

(xii) Indebtedness Incurred in any Qualified Securitization Financing;

(xiii) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with a Credit
Facility for purposes of financing any expansion projects in an aggregate amount not exceeding
€30 million outstanding at any one time plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness
permitted under this clause (xiii) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;
and

(xiv) in addition to the items referred to in clauses (i) through (xiii) above, Indebtedness of the Issuer
and any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate amount not exceeding €30 million outstanding at
any one time; provided that the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness that may be incurred
pursuant to this clause (xiv) by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed
€10 million outstanding at any one time.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant:


-----

(i) in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the foregoing first paragraph of this covenant “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” and clauses (i) through (xiv) of the second paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in_
its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify and may from time to time reclassify such item of
Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and include the amount and type of
such Indebtedness in one or more of the foregoing clauses (i) through (xiv) of the second paragraph
of this covenant or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that all Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date under any Credit Facility shall be deemed incurred under clause
(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not under the first paragraph of this covenant or
clause (iv) of the second paragraph of this covenant and may not later be reclassified;

(ii) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness Incurred in reliance on a clause of
this covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness”measured by reference to a percentage of Total Assets
at the time of incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the relevant percentage restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the relevant percentage of Total Assets on the date of such
refinancing, such percentage of Total Assets shall be deemed not to be exceeded, as long as the
principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs, fees
and other expenses in connection with such refinancing;

(iii) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously
repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a
Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be
deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was
first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(iv) for the purposes of determining Total Assets under this covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness”,
Total Assets shall be measured at the option of the Issuer on the most recent date on which new
commitments are obtained or on the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred;

(v) in the event Indebtedness relates to Guarantees of Indebtedness permitted by this covenant, such
Guarantees shall not be treated as an additional Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(vi) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (i),
(ix), (x), (xiii) or (xiv) of the second paragraph of this covenant or under the first paragraph of this
covenant and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptance or other similar instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included.

(vii) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Guarantor, or preferred stock of
a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(viii) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(A) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original
issue discount;

(B) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(C) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(x) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(y) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person;

(ix) for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence
of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
another currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the
case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving Credit Facility; provided that:


-----

(A) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the
Issue Date will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
Issue Date; and

(B) if for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to an agreement intended to protect against
fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such
Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount
of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro will be the amount of the principal payment
required to be made under such currency agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of
such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable
but is not covered by such currency agreement; and

(x) the principal amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same currency as the
Indebtedness being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced
determined as of the date such Indebtedness was originally Incurred, except that to the extent that:

(A) such Euro Equivalent was determined based on an agreement intended to protect against
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be
determined in accordance with sub-clause (B) of clause (viii) above; and

(B) the principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Euro Equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such Refinancing Indebtedness is being Incurred.

the time of such Restricted Payment:

Initial Agreement (an “Amendment”); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions

Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment
relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) and
either (x) the Issuer determines that such encumbrances and restrictions will not adversely affect
the Issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments on the Notes as and when they come
due or (y) such encumbrances and restrictions apply only during the continuance of a default in
respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness;

subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment of transfer of any such lease,
license or other contract entered into in the ordinary course of business;

compliance with the Conditions of Issue to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions
restrict the transfer of the property subject so such mortgages, pledges or other security

Directors of the Issuer or relevant Restricted Subsidiary, result in any civil or criminal liability of
any directors or officers of the relevant Restricted Subsidiary) or any applicable rule, regulation or
order or governmental license, permit or concession;

by insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts (not evidencing or relating
to Indebtedness) entered into in the ordinary course of business;

contained in the terms of the agreement or agreements governing such joint venture; provided,
however, that any such encumbrance or restriction (i) is customary in joint venture agreements,
(ii) is not less favorable to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary than to any other joint venturer
and (iii) will not materially affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the
Notes, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, at the time of entering
into such agreement or agreements (and at the time of any modification of the terms of any such
encumbrance or restriction); and

(xiii) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be Incurred

not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable


-----

financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer) and where, in the

such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes as and when they come due or (y) the
Issuer determines that such encumbrances and restrictions apply only during the continuance of a
default in respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(i) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at least equal to the Fair Market
Value (such Fair Market Value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset
Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer (including as to
the value of all non-cash consideration), of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition;

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, at least 75% of the consideration is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of this “—Limitation on Sales of Assets” covenant, each of the following
shall be deemed cash:

(A) any liabilities, as shown on the Issuer’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities, Disqualified Stock and liabilities
that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by
the transferee of any such assets pursuant to any agreement that releases the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary from or indemnifies against further liability;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary from
such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary into cash
or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Disposition, to the
extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(C) any Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted
Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(D) consideration consisting of Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(E) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received and designated pursuant to this clause (E) that is at any one time
outstanding, not to exceed €15 million (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent the Issuer elects, to prepay, repay or purchase (x) Indebtedness that is secured by a
Permitted Collateral Lien that ranks equal to or in priority to any Lien on such assets securing
the Notes and the Note Guarantees and is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes and
the Note Guarantees (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and any purchase or redemption of any Notes (provided that any such purchase
or redemption is at or above 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of such prepayment, repayment,
purchase or redemption)), (y) Indebtedness which is secured by a Lien (other than a Permitted
Collateral Lien) on the asset which is the subject of the Asset Sale or (z) Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or
an Affiliate of the Issuer), in each case, within 395 days from the date of the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or
purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this sub-clause (A), the Issuer or such Restricted


-----

Subsidiary will cause the related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an equal
amount to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(B) to invest in Additional Assets within 395 days from the date of receipt of such Net Available
Cash or pursuant to binding arrangements in place within such 395 day period; provided that
such binding arrangement is completed within 180 days of such 395 day period;

(C) to make a capital expenditure within 395 days from the date of receipt of such Net Available
Cash or pursuant to binding arrangements in place within such 395-day period; provided that
such binding arrangement is completed within 180 days of such 395-day period; or

(D) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with the
foregoing sub-clauses (A) to (C) (the “Excess Proceeds”), to make an offer to the Holders and
any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (to the extent the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness so
require) on a pro rata basis to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the
date of purchase and such Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to and subject to the Conditions
of Issue (an “Asset Disposition Offer”); provided, however, that in connection with any
prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to the foregoing sub-clause (A),
the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall retire such Indebtedness and shall cause
the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchase.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this “—Limitation on Sales of Assets” covenant, the Issuer or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall not be required to apply any Excess Proceeds in accordance with
sub-clause (D) above unless the aggregate Excess Proceeds from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in
accordance with the foregoing sub-clauses (A) to (C) exceeds €15 million. To the extent that the aggregate
amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an
Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for
general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Conditions of Issue. If the aggregate
principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by
holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall accept the Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the Asset Disposition Offer. Upon
completion of such Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Asset
Disposition Offer will remain open for a period of 20 Business Days following its commencement, except to
the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition
**Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness required**
to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the
Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if
less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, in each case with a
principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will promptly
(but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period)
mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes or holder or lender of Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case
may be, an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn by such holder or lender, as the case may be, and accepted by the Issuer for
purchase. In addition, the Issuer will take any and all other actions required by the agreements governing the
Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer on the
Asset Disposition Purchase Date.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into
any transaction or series of related transactions (including the rendering of services) with any Affiliate of the
Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate
consideration in excess of €5 million unless:


-----

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction with
a Person who is not an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of €10 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer (and such majority determines that such Affiliate Transaction
satisfies the criteria in clause (i)).

The provisions of the foregoing paragraph shall not apply to:

(i) transactions pursuant to any employee or director compensation arrangements or benefit plans
entered into by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business of
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing;

(iii) any Affiliate Transaction between the Issuer and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(iv) any Restricted Payment (other than a Restricted Investment) permitted to be made pursuant to the
provisions set forth under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” above;

(v) the payment of reasonable and customary fees paid to, and indemnity provided on behalf of, officers,
directors or employees of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(vi) the incurrence of Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(vii) the advance of any Parent Loans by the Parent to the Issuer;

(viii)transactions pursuant to, or contemplated, by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and
transactions pursuant to any amendment (including to change any party to the agreement),
modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or extension,
taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the Holders than the original agreement as in effect
on the Issue Date;

(ix) any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to Affiliates of the
Issuer;

(x) transactions (x) with the Parent and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, consistent
with past practice and as otherwise permitted hereunder or (y) or which the Issuer shall have received
a written opinion from an independent investment bank or an accounting or appraisal firm of
internationally recognized standing or other recognized independent expert of international
standing with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of
related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that such Affiliate Transaction is (a) fair
to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (b) not materially less
favorable than those that might reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such
time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate;

(xi) (x) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or
providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of trading, or (y) any
transaction in the ordinary course of business between the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
and any Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because a director of such Person is also a
director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, in each case, provided (a) such
transaction is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Conditions of Issue and (b) is on terms
at least as favorable as could have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person, in the
reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer
provided such Officer has been delegated such power by the Board of Directors in the prior
twelve months (provided no member of the Board of Directors or Officer of the Issuer with an
interest in such transaction may participate in such determination); and

(xii) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between or among the
Parent, the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary and any other Person with which the Parent, the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries files a consolidated tax return or with which the Parent,


-----

the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is part of a group for tax purposes or any tax
advantageous group contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation; provided, however, that
such payments or transactions will not exceed the lesser of (i) the amount of tax that the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries would owe on a stand-alone basis if the Issuer were filing a separate tax
return (or a separate consolidated or combined tax return with its Restricted Subsidiaries that are
part of that consolidated or combined group) and (ii) the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries that are relieved thereby.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish in English to the Holders in accordance with
clause (ii) of “—Notices”:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer (beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2023), annual reports containing the following information: (a) audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years,
including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors
on the financial statements; (b) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the
Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as
to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a
previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below (provided that such pro forma financial
information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which
case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials to the
extent available without unreasonable expense)); (c) an operating and financial review of the audited
financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations (including a discussion by
business segment to the extent segment reporting is required under GAAP), financial condition and
liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and
critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the
Issuer, material affiliate transactions and material debt instruments (unless such contractual
arrangements were described in a previous annual or quarterly report, in which case the Issuer need
describe only any material changes); and (e) material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Issuer (beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024), quarterly reports containing the
following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such
quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the quarterly and year to
date periods ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and, the comparable prior year
periods for the Issuer, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) pro forma income statement
and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates (provided that such
pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable
expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials (to the extent available without unreasonable expense)); (c) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements (including a discussion by business segment
to the extent segment reporting is required under GAAP), including a discussion of the consolidated
financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and any material change between the
current quarterly period and the corresponding period of the prior year; and (d) material recent
developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any changes of the chief executive officer, chief
financial officer or managing director of the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer or any other
material event that the Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event;

provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to (i) contain
any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or IFRS or (ii) include separate financial
statements for any Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In addition, if the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant


-----

Subsidiary, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as provided for above, no report
needs to include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure
with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included
in this offering memorandum.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the
Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to
be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, the
Issuer will also (a) post such report on the Issuer’s website and (b) make available copies of such reports to the
Listing Agent, for the purpose of sending to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (to the
extent required by the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Holders’ Representative, the
Holders, prospective purchasers and beneficial owners of the Notes if such information referenced above in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above has been posted on the Issuer’s website.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer shall not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into another Person, or convey,
transfer or lease all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union as of December 31, 2003,
Switzerland, the United States of America or the District of Columbia, and the Successor Company
(if not the Issuer) will expressly assume in appropriate documentation delivered to the Holders’
Representative all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Agency Agreements and the Conditions of Issue;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of
such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and any related financings the Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause
(i)(x) of the first paragraph of the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant above;

(iv) each Guarantor shall have delivered to the Holders’ Representative a confirmation that its Note
Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations in respect of the Notes and the relevant Agency
Agreement;

(v) if any such transaction results in the Issuer or Successor Company being incorporated in a
jurisdiction other than Germany, the Board of Directors of the Issuer and the Successor Company
will have adopted a resolution stating that the transaction effecting such a change in jurisdiction was
not being entered into for a purpose which included subjecting the Issuer or the Successor Company,
as the case may be, to more favorable bankruptcy, insolvency, laws relating to creditors rights or
similar laws; and

(vi) the Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative an Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion
of Counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and
such assumption by the Successor Company comply with this covenant and the Opinion of Counsel
shall state in addition that each of the Note Guarantees shall apply to such Person’s obligations in
respect of the Notes and the relevant Agency Agreement to the same or greater extent than they
applied to the Notes and the relevant Agency Agreement immediately prior to such transaction. The
Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of


-----

compliance with this paragraph and shall not be obligated to independently investigate whether the
requirements of this paragraph are otherwise met.

**_Guarantors_**

In addition, the Issuer shall not permit any Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to consolidate with or merge
with or into another Person, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all the properties and assets of
such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to
another Person, unless:

(i) either:

(A) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person will be a Person organized and existing under the
laws of any member state of the European Union on 31 December 2003, Switzerland, the
United States of America, the District of Columbia or the jurisdiction in which it was originally
organized, and such Person (if not a Guarantor) will expressly assume in an appropriate
documentation and delivered to the Holders’ Representative, all the obligations of such
Guarantor under its Note Guarantee(s); or

(B) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the
properties and assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Conditions of Issue;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to, and as a result of, such transaction no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing;

(iii) in the case of clause (i)(A) above, if any such transaction results in the Guarantor or Successor
Company being incorporated in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which it was organized
as of the Issue Date, the Board of Directors of the Guarantor and the Successor Company will have
adopted a resolution stating that the transaction effecting such a change in jurisdiction was not
being entered into for a purpose which included subjecting the Guarantor or the Successor
Company, as the case may be, to more favorable bankruptcy, insolvency, laws relating to creditors
rights or similar laws; and

(iv) the Issuer and such Guarantor shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative in accordance with
“Notices” an Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that such
consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, in the case of clause (i)(A) only, such
assumption by the resulting, surviving or transferee Person comply with this covenant and the
Opinion of Counsel shall state in addition that the Note Guarantee by the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person shall apply to such Person’s obligations in respect of the Notes and the relevant
Agency Agreement to the same or greater extent than they applied to the Notes and the relevant
Agency Agreement immediately prior to such transaction. The Holders’ Representative shall be
entitled to accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of compliance with this paragraph
and shall not be obligated to independently investigate whether the requirements of this paragraph
are otherwise met.

The Successor Guarantor to any Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the
applicable Note Guarantee.

This “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation, merger or transfer of
assets of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor into the Issuer or a Guarantor, (b) any
consolidation, merger or transfer of assets among Guarantors, or (c) any consolidation, merger or transfer of
assets among the Issuer and any Guarantor; provided that, clauses (i) and (vi) of the first paragraph of this
covenant will be complied with. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph and clause (ii) of the second
paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any merger or consolidation of the Issuer or any Guarantors
with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or such Guarantor in another
jurisdiction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable German law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries or a Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable.


-----

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and the
rules of the International Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of the occurrence of any
of the events described in this “—Merger and Consolidation”covenant in accordance with the prevailing rules
of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited.

**_Future Guarantors_**

The Issuer shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and that, (a) after the Issue Date,
Guarantees any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor or (b) is a Significant Subsidiary, to execute and
deliver concurrently to the Holders’ Representative a Note Guarantee pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Notes, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with
such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

Any such Restricted Subsidiary will, simultaneously with the execution of such Note Guarantee, pledge its
existing and future assets to the extent such assets secure the obligations under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility (in particular, subject to the Agreed Security Principles as set forth therein) or the Existing
Notes to secure the Notes and its Note Guarantee, and the Issuer will cause all of the Capital Stock in such
Restricted Subsidiary owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to be pledged to secure the Notes
and the Note Guarantees.

Each Additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available
to guarantors (including those that relate to general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, financial assistance or thin-capitalization rules or other similar laws or
regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security_
_Interests”._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably
be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be prevented or
otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary (including
“whitewash”or similar procedures) or any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on Lines of Business_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a
Related Business, except as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the
International Stock Exchange for so long as any Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to
obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of the Notes on another recognized
stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be another stock exchange that is not regulated by the
European Union).

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent
or vote with respect to any waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Conditions of Issue,
the Notes, the relevant Agency Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Note
Guarantee unless (and to the extent such offer or payment is not prohibited by applicable law) such
consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time
frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or amendment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or
payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms


-----

or provisions of the Conditions of Issue, to exclude the Holders in any jurisdiction where (A)(i) the solicitation
of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the
payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a
registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but
not limited to, the U.S. federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member states),
which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome (it
being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other
jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial
services authorities in such jurisdiction) or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under
applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries shall be Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the Issuer (including any newly acquired
or newly formed Subsidiary or a Person becoming a Subsidiary through merger, consolidation or other
business combination transaction, or Investment therein) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary only if:

(i) such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of or
have any Investment in, or own or hold any Lien on any property of, any other Subsidiary of the
Issuer which is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated or otherwise an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(ii) no Indebtedness of such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at the date of designation, or at
any time thereafter, constitute Indebtedness pursuant to which the lender has recourse to any of the
assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(iii) such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary
has any direct or indirect obligation to:

(A) subscribe for additional Capital Stock of such Person; or

(B) maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or cause such person to achieve any
specified levels of operating results;

(iv) all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid)
in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount which shall
be the Restricted Payment’s Fair Market Value at the time of such transfer and a Restricted Payment
in such amount would be permitted at such time under the covenant set forth under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” or the definition of “Permitted Investments” and if such Subsidiary_
otherwise meets the definition of an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”; and

(v) after giving effect to, and as a result of, such designation there will be no Default or Event of Default.

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary;
provided, however, that such designation shall be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation shall be
permitted only if (i) immediately after giving effect to such designation, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the Issuer could Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness as
described in clause (i)(x) of the first paragraph under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, on a pro forma basis
taking into account such designation as if it had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period.
Any such designation by the Board of Directors of the Issuer shall be evidenced to the Holders’Representative
by filing with the Holders’ Representative a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer giving effect to
such designation and an Officers’ Request Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the
foregoing conditions. The Holders’ Representative shall forward such resolution of the Board of Directors of
the Issuer and the Officers’ Request Certificate to the Holders in accordance with the procedures set forth in
“—Notices”.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission might or would have the result of materially
impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Liens


-----

on the Collateral permitted by the definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens” shall under no circumstances be
deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Holders’
Representative and the Holders, and the Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Holders and the
other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that

(i) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with
the Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents; and

(ii) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and provided further,
however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented
or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification or renewal, the Issuer delivers to the Security
Agent either:

(A) a solvency opinion from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
standing confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement;

(B) a certificate from the chief financial officer, chief executive officer or the Board of Directors of
the relevant Person, which confirms the solvency of the person granting Security Interest after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement; or

(C) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes
created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
modified or replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph which shall not apply to the actions described in this paragraph, at
the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders or the Holders’Representative, the Security
Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens to the extent
permitted by the Conditions of Issue; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) comply with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (v) evidence the succession of another Person to the
Issuer and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Conditions of Issue, the Notes and
the Security Documents, in each case, in accordance with “—Merger and Consolidation”; (vi) provide for the
release of property and assets constituting Collateral from the Lien of the Security Documents or the release
of a Note Guarantee granted by a Guarantor, in each case, in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms
of the Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor Agreement; (vii) conform the Security Documents to this
“Description of the Notes”; (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor
Holders’ Representative or Security Agent; or (ix) make any other change thereto that does not adversely
affect the rights of the Holders in any material respect.

In the event that the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary complies with this covenant, the Holders’
Representative and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent
to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement with no need
for instructions from Holders.

**_Security_**

The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each Guarantor shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts
and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require

(i) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the
security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents; and


-----

(ii) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any
part of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of
all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any
part of those assets. The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each Guarantor shall, execute all
transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or
to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably
request.

**_Amendment and Restatement of Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

Following the redemption in full of the Existing Notes, we intend to enter into an amendment and restatement
agreement relating to the Intercreditor Agreement as described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement”. At the direction of the Issuer and without further consent of_
the Holders’ Representative, the Security Agent or any Holder, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the
Holders’ Representative and the Security Agent and, to the extent applicable, other relevant creditors and
their respective creditor representatives shall enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement to (1) ensure that any Pari Passu Note Holders’ Representative (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) will have the same rights, powers, discretions, duties and obligations under the Intercreditor
Agreement with respect to the noteholders it represents as the holders’ representative under the Existing
Notes (which may involve replacing certain references in the Intercreditor Agreement to the term “Holders’
Representative” with the term “Pari Passu Note Holders’ Representative”), (2) amend the definitions of
“Restricted Group” and/or “Restricted Subsidiary” to make them dynamic and align with and refer to the
relevant concept under the “Credit Facility Documents”and/or “Pari Passu Debt Documents”(each as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) as in effect from time to time, (3) replace relevant references to a “trustee” in
Clause 24.2(a) of the Intercreditor Agreement with references to the relevant notes trustee or joint
representative, as applicable, (4) replace references to “Senior Noteholders” in Schedule 7, Clause 5 of the
Intercreditor Agreement with “Pari Passu Noteholders”, (5) cure any ambiguities and/or circularity in the
definitions of “Pari Passu Debt Creditors”, “Pari Passu Debt Documents” and “Pari Passu Debt Liabilities”,
provided that such cure does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect, and (6) cure any other
ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency in the Intercreditor Agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders in any material respect (the “ICA Amendment Agreement”).

Furthermore, at the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the Incurrence of any Indebtedness that
is permitted to share the Collateral, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Holders’ Representative, the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Finance Parties and the Security Agent shall enter into an additional
intercreditor agreement (each an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on terms substantially similar to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or not materially less favorable to the Holders) or an amendment to the Intercreditor
Agreement (which amendment has been confirmed by Opinion of Counsel addressed to the Holders’
Representative to not adversely affect the rights of the Holders); provided that such Intercreditor Agreement
or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Holders’
Representative or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Holders’Representative under the Conditions of Issue or the Intercreditor Agreement. The Issuer shall notify
the Holders of the entry of an Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any amendment to the Intercreditor
Agreement effected pursuant to this covenant without undue delay in accordance with procedures set forth in
the Conditions of Issue.

The Conditions of Issue will also provide that, at the request, and subject to the following paragraphs, the
Holders’Representative and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the further consent of the
Holders to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement
that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of
payment to the Notes); (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries or Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (4) further secure the Notes (including any additional Notes); (5) make
provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure additional Pari Passu Debt Liabilities
(including additional Notes); (6) implement any Permitted Liens and Permitted Collateral Liens; (7) amend
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof;
(8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to (i) remove any references
to any instruments governing any existing Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor


-----

Agreement) following the full redemption or repayment of such Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and the
cancellation or termination of the relevant instruments, as applicable and/or (ii) replace any such references
with references to any new instruments governing any new Pari Passu Debt Liabilities that replaces and/or
refinances any existing Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, in each case in accordance with the Conditions of Issue; or
(9) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material
respect.

The Conditions of Issue will also provide that the Holders’ Representative shall be authorized to enter into a
creditor/creditor representative accession agreement as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the ICA Amendment Agreement and any amendment referred to in the
preceding paragraphs and that neither the Holders’ Representative nor the Security Agent shall be required to
seek the consent of any Holders to perform their obligations under and in accordance with this covenant,
provided that the Holders’ Representative shall—in case of any amendment referred to in the preceding
paragraphs—not waive any rights of the Holders without their prior consent to be given by majority
resolution passed pursuant to this covenant. Before entering into an Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
effecting any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement (other than pursuant to the ICA Amendment
Agreement) pursuant to this covenant, the Holders’ Representative or the Security Agent may elect to base its
decision on an Officers’ Request Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Holders’ Representative or the Security Agent, as applicable. Neither the Holders’
Representative nor the Security Agent shall be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in
reliance on such Officers’ Request Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall notify the Holders of
the entry of an Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement (other
than pursuant to the ICA Amendment Agreement) effected pursuant to this covenant without undue delay in
accordance with procedures set forth in the Conditions of Issue.

**_Suspension of Covenants_**

If on any date following the date of the Conditions of Issue:

(i) the Notes are rated with an Investment Grade Rating by both Rating Agencies; and

(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Conditions of Issue (the foregoing conditions
being referred to collectively as the “Suspension Condition”);

then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants specifically
listed under the following captions in this “Description of the Notes”(collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”)
of the Conditions of Issue will be suspended as to the Notes:

- “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

- “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

- “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

- “—Limitation on Sales of Assets”;

- “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

- “—Limitation on Lines of Business”;

- “—Future Guarantors”; and

- clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph and (ii) of the second paragraph, respectively, of “—Merger
and Consolidation”.

During any period that the foregoing sections have been suspended, the Issuer’s Board of Directors may not
designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to “—Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries” unless the designation would have complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation_
_on Restricted Payments”._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants with respect to the Notes for any period of time as a result of the Suspension Condition having
been met and, subsequently, one or both Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or
downgrade the Investment Grade Rating assigned to the Notes such that the Notes no longer have an
Investment Grade Rating by both Rating Agencies, then the Issuer and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries will
thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants. (a) Compliance with the Suspended Covenants with
respect to Restricted Payments made after the time of such withdrawal or downgrade (i) will be calculated in


-----

accordance with the terms of the reinstated “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant as if the
provisions had been in effect since the Issue Date (accordingly, Restricted Payments made during such period
when the Suspended Covenants are suspended will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments described under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) and (ii) will be
calculated in accordance with the terms of the reinstated “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant as if any
Indebtedness incurred on or after the occurrence of the Suspension Condition will be deemed to have been
incurred pursuant to the first paragraph described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; and (b) the Issuer
will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary that would have been required to Guarantee the Notes pursuant
to “—Future Guarantors”during such period when the Suspended Covenants are suspended to take all actions
it would have been required to take to comply with “—Future Guarantors” if it had not been suspended
including executing a Note Guarantee and pledging the Restricted Subsidiary’s existing and future assets and
pledging all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantee;
provided, further, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the
Conditions of Issue with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries will bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring after such Notes attain the
required ratings and before any reinstatement of the Suspended Covenants as provided above, or any actions,
taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligations arising prior to the reinstatement of the Suspended
Covenants, regardless of whether those actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable sections
had remained in effect during such period.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Conditions of Issue in connection with
the making of any capital expenditure investments (including with regard to the Incurrence of any related
Indebtedness or the making of any related Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments, as the case may
be), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the
option of the Issuer, be the Commitment Date (as defined below) with regard to any such capital expenditure
investments for purposes of determining the ability to Incur any related Indebtedness or make any related
Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments (in each case, as set forth in the then-current budget for
such capital expenditure investment prepared in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer and approved by the
Board of Directors of the Issuer) after the Commitment Date (and not for purposes of any subsequent
availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are
exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio or any component thereof (including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets) subsequent to such date of determination and at or
prior to the Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or the making of any related Restricted Payments and/or
Permitted Investments, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Incurrence of any such related Indebtedness or
the making of any such Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments are permitted hereunder and (y) such
baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time any such related Indebtedness is actually Incurred or any such
Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments are actually made; provided further, that if the Issuer elects to
have such determinations occur at the Commitment Date, the Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or the
making of any related Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments shall be deemed to have occurred
on the Commitment Date and any such Indebtedness shall be deemed to be outstanding thereafter for
purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Conditions of Issue after the Commitment Date and
before the earlier of (i) the actual Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or the actual making of any related
Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments, as applicable and (ii) the date on which the Issuer
determines that the relevant capital expenditure investment has been completed or abandoned (as set forth in
an Officers’ Request Certificate). “Commitment Date” with regard to any capital expenditure investment for
the purpose of this covenant shall mean the date specified as such in a resolution of the Board of Directors of
the Issuer; provided that the Issuer and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, on the date of such resolutions,
reasonably expects to enter, within three months of the date of such resolution, into one or more definitive
agreements with one or more third parties with regard to the realization of such capital expenditure investment
with an aggregate value of no less than €20 million.

**Events of Default, Enforcement**

Each of the following constitutes an “Event of Default” under the Conditions of Issue:

(a) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;


-----

(b) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due and payable at its
Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon acceleration or
otherwise;

(c) failure by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to comply with any obligation under the covenant set
forth under “—Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”, “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders
_upon a Change of Control”, or “—Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets”, continued for 30 days,_
other than a failure to purchase Notes which shall constitute an Event of Default under the foregoing
clause (b);

(d) failure by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to comply for 60 days after notice from the Holders’
Representative (upon instruction by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding) with its other obligations contained in the Conditions of Issue;

(e) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for borrowed money by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the Conditions of Issue, which
default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay when due principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such
Indebtedness prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period provided for under the
terms of such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated aggregates €10 million or more;

(f) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization under bankruptcy laws of (i) the Issuer,
(ii) a Guarantor or (iii) a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary;

(g) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
€10 million (net of any amounts that are covered by insurance policies issued by reputable and
creditworthy insurance companies), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period
of 60 days after the judgment exceeding such threshold becomes final;

(h) any Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full
force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Conditions of
Issue or as provided under applicable law) or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or the
Issuer or any such Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing or in any pleading in any court its
obligations under the Conditions of Issue or its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for
ten days; or

(i) with respect to any Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of €5 million, individually or in
the aggregate, (i) (a) the security interest under the Conditions of Issue or the Security Documents,
at any time, ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason other than in accordance with the
terms of the Security Documents and other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Notes or (b) any security interest created thereunder or under the Security Documents is declared
invalid or unenforceable and such Default continues for 15 days after the Issuer becomes aware of
the Default or (ii) the Issuer or any Guarantor asserts that any such security interest or Security
Document is invalid or unenforceable prior to the time that the Collateral is to be released to the
Issuer or the Guarantors.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default pursuant to the foregoing clause (f)) occurs and is
continuing, the Holders’ Representative upon instruction of Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
all outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer shall terminate the Notes and declare the principal
amount of and all accrued interest under all outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. If an
Event of Default with respect to the Issuer pursuant to the foregoing clause (f) occurs and is continuing, the


-----

Notes will automatically be terminated and all payments under the Notes will become due and payable
immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Holders’ Representative or any Holder.
Certain enforcement actions, including acceleration, will be suspended during a consultation period under
the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default pursuant to foregoing
clause (e) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically
annulled if the relevant default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to the foregoing clause (e) shall be
remedied or cured by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant
Indebtedness, or the relevant Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged
in full, within 20 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium, or interest on the Notes
that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

The Holders may rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences within three months
of the acceleration by simple majority vote of the Holders if such rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the aggregate of such cast
votes exceeds the number of votes having required the acceleration.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default
will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed in “—Covenants—Reports”, or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate
pursuant to any other provision of the Conditions of Issue shall be deemed to be cured upon delivery of any
such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Conditions of Issue.

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder
may pursue any remedy with respect to the Conditions of Issue or the Notes unless:

(a) such Holder has previously given the Holders’ Representative notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(b) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Holders’ Representative to pursue the remedy;

(c) the Holders’ Representative has not complied with such request within 60 days following the receipt
of the request; and

(d) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not within such 60 day
period given the Holders’ Representative a written direction, that, in the opinion of the Holders’
Representative, is inconsistent with such request.

Subject to the Conditions of Issue and applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the Holders’ Representative or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Holders’ Representative.

The Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative for delivery to the Holders in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Condition of Issue, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (and within 20
Business Days upon request at any time after the 120 days), an Officers’ Request Certificate stating whether
the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to
deliver to the Holders’ Representative, after becoming aware of the occurrence thereof, written notice of any
events of which it is aware which would constitute Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Holders’ Representative may or, subject to the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to any Note Guarantee and the Collateral, the Security Agent
may:

(a) in its sole discretion, but shall not be required to, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the
Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Holders’ Representative or the Security


-----

Agent, as applicable, shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the Conditions of Issue or any Note
Guarantee or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper
remedy, including making demand under one or more of the Note Guarantees on behalf of the
Holders; and

(b) prosecute and enforce all rights of action and claims under the Conditions of Issue or any Note
Guarantee without the possession of any of the Notes or the Global Notes or the production thereof
in any proceeding relating thereto, and to bring any such proceeding on behalf of the Holders.

**Amendments and Waivers**

In accordance with the German Act on Debt Securities of 2009 (SchVG) the Holders may, by resolution with
the majority specified in the following paragraph below, (i) agree with the Issuer on amendments to the
Conditions of Issue, with regard to matters permitted by the SchVG, (ii) consent to such amendments of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantees and the Security Documents which require such consent by the
Holders, (iii) alter the powers and duties of, and give instructions and consents to, the Holders’Representative
to the extent the Holders’ Representative has the right but not the obligation to accept such additional powers
and duties and (iv) appoint, and revoke the appointment of any Holders’Representative. Majority resolutions
shall be binding on all Holders. Resolutions which do not provide for identical conditions for all Holders are
void, unless Holders who are disadvantaged have expressly consented to their being treated disadvantageously.

Unless a higher majority is required under mandatory provisions of statutory law, resolutions shall be passed
by a majority of the Holders of not less than 50% plus one vote of the votes cast (including, votes obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes); provided, however, that resolutions regarding:

(i) any reduction of the relevant premium to be paid upon repurchase of the Notes or any change in the
time at which the Note is to be repurchased pursuant to the provision described under “—Optional
_Redemption” and under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control”;_

(ii) any amendment or termination of any of the Security Documents (other than amendments provided
for in the Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents);

(iii) any change of the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any instalment of interest on, or change to
an earlier redemption date of, or waiver of a default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on, any Notes (except a rescission or acceleration of the Notes by simple majority
resolution of the meeting of the Holders and a waiver of the Payment Default that resulted from
such acceleration) or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or change
the coin or currency in which the principal of any such Note or any premium or the interest thereon
is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment after the
Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

(iv) any reduction in the principal amount of outstanding Notes;

(v) the modification of any of the provisions relating to amendments requiring the consent of holders
or relating to the waiver of past defaults or the waiver of covenants, except to increase the percentage
of outstanding Notes required for such actions;

(vi) the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee except in accordance
with the Conditions of Issue, such Note Guarantee and the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(vii) any change to the preceding amendment and waiver provisions;

shall require the consent of not less than 90% of the votes cast of the Notes (including, consents obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes).

For the avoidance of doubt, it is not necessary for the Holders to consent to the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if the Holders consent to the substance of any proposed amendment.

The Conditions of Issue or the Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented without the
consent of any Holder:

(i) to cure any ambiguity, to correct any error which is of formal, minor or technical nature, or to
correct or supplement any provision in the Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement or the
Procedural Rules that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision in the Conditions of


-----

Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Procedural Rules; provided that, in each case, such
provisions shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders;

(ii) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations under the Conditions of
Issue, the Guarantee Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Procedural Rules in the case of
a merger or other amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s
assets, as the case may be; provided that such merger, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all
assets is not prohibited by the Conditions of Issue or any Guarantee;

(iii) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders;

(iv) to add additional Guarantees, or to release Guarantors from Guarantees in accordance with and if
permitted by the terms of the Conditions of Issue;

(v) to further secure the Notes, or to release all or any portion of the Collateral in accordance with and
if permitted by the terms of the Conditions of Issue;

(vi) to enter into an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or to amend the Intercreditor Agreement, as
contemplated under “—Covenants—”Amendment and Restatement of the Intercreditor Agreement;
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements”; or_

(vii) to provide for the issuance of additional Notes as contemplated under “—General—Additional
_Notes” and if permitted by the terms and limitations of the Conditions of Issue._

Holders shall pass resolutions by vote taken without a meeting in accordance with the Procedural Rules,
unless the Holders’ Representative or Holders representing in the aggregate at least 5% of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding expressly request that a meeting of Holders takes place. The vote shall
be chaired by a notary appointed by the Issuer or, if the Holders’ Representative has convened the vote, by the
Holders’ Representative.

Each Holder participating in any vote shall cast votes in accordance with the nominal amount or the notional
share of its entitlement to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes.

Exercise of voting rights in a vote without meeting is subject to the Holders registration. Registration must be
received at the address stated in the request for voting by no later than the third day preceding the voting
period.

Attendance at a meeting and exercise of voting rights is subject to the Holders registration. Registration must
be received at the address stated in the convening notice by no later than the third day preceding the meeting.

Along with the registration the person that convened the meeting or the person that solicited the vote must
receive a proof of eligibility for exercising voting rights. Holders must demonstrate their eligibility to
participate in the vote by means of a written special confirmation of the custodian and by submission of a
blocking instruction by the custodian stating that the respective Notes are not transferable from the day the
registration has been sent (including) to the stated end of the meeting (including).

The notice for solicitation of votes shall give details as to the prerequisites which must be met for votes to
qualify for being counted.

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance**

The Conditions of Issue will provide that the Issuer may, as evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers’
Request Certificate, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to
the outstanding Notes and the Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will
be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes that are
being defeased and Note Guarantees except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust account
referred to below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to exchange any Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes,
maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such
payments in trust;


-----

(c) the rights and obligations of the Holders’ Representative and the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the “Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance” provisions of the Conditions of Issue.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Conditions of Issue (“Covenant
**Defeasance”), and thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an**
Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described
under “—Events of Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These
events do not include events relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of
whether it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(i) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in a trust account for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes, cash in euro, non-callable European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of the Issuer (acting in
good faith), to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the outstanding
Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the
Issuer must (x) prior to depositing such monies or securities to the trust account, procure an Opinion
of Counsel stating, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, that the trust account will
be bankruptcy remote; (y) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such Stated Maturity or
to a particular redemption date; and (z) if applicable, have delivered to the Holders’ Representative
an irrevocable notice to redeem all the outstanding Notes of such principal, premium, if any, or
interest;

(ii) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative an
Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the original issue date of the Notes, there has
been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based
thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(iii) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(iv) the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’Representative an Officers’Request Certificate stating
that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes
over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding
creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(v) the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’Representative an Officers’Request Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all

unless such Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and the related commitment
terminated), Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed Charges for such period shall be calculated after
giving effect on a pro forma basis to such discharge of such Indebtedness, including with the

Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such Indebtedness after such sale);

(4) if since the beginning of such period the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or otherwise)
will have made an Investment in any Restricted Subsidiary (or any Person which becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary or is merged with or into the Issuer) or an acquisition of assets, including any
acquisition of assets occurring in connection with a transaction requiring a calculation to be made
hereunder, and which constitutes all or substantially all of a company, division, operating unit,
segment, business, group of related assets or line of business, Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed
Charges for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the
Incurrence of any Indebtedness) as if such Investment or acquisition occurred on the first day of
such period; and

(5) if since the beginning of such period any Person (that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary
or was merged with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such
period) will have Incurred any Indebtedness or discharged any Indebtedness, made any Asset


-----

Disposition or any Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an adjustment
pursuant to clause (3) or (4) of this definition if made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
during such period, Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed Charges for such period shall be calculated
after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Incurrence or discharge of Indebtedness, Asset

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any calculation under this
definition, the pro forma calculations (including, without limitation, in respect of anticipated expense or cost
savings and expense or cost synergies relating to any such transaction) shall be determined in good faith by a
responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest

in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account
any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness).

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations regarding the European Union,
Germany, France, Italy and Poland. The descriptions below are only a summary and do not purport to be
complete or to discuss all insolvency law considerations that may affect the enforceability of the obligations of
the Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes”.

**EUROPEAN UNION**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015
on insolvency proceedings (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of July 4, 2018, the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the
European Union. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective
insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

**_Main insolvency proceedings_**

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union (the
“Member State”) (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The
“center of main interests”is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests
on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the center of main interests of a company or legal person is presumed to be located in the Member
State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the
registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three month period prior to the
request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption
where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than the one where it has its
registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner
that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of
the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration
should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its
interests. In the event of a shift in the center of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the
new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the
change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other
appropriate means).

If the “center of main interests” of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a
Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the
EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the
EU Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within
the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have
jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with
them, such as avoidance actions.

**_Secondary insolvency proceedings_**

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized
in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in other
Member States. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark),
under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than
Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary”or “territorial”insolvency proceedings only in the event that
such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may
be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of
doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings
which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to
secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any place of
operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open
main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of


-----

those territorial insolvency proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of
such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in
which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings
can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and either:
(a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of main
interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at
the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such establishment or
a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective Member State’s law,
requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or
secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the
_lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the respective_
main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the court
of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another
Member State (such as to remove the debtor’s assets from the territory of the Member State in which they are
situated), subject to certain limitations, so long as no other insolvency proceedings have been opened in that
other Member State or any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open
insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member
State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary
insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to
comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which the local creditors
would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the assets are located.
Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local
creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the
insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should, at the request
of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if it is
satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay
the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that
suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from
the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months,
unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay
may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets,
the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable
measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual
classes of creditors.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will
be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by
the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

In the event that the Parent, the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect
the enforceability of the obligations of the Parent, Issuer, the Guarantors and the collateral provided by any
other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective
companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is
no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation
to one another.


-----

That being said, the opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State shall not affect the rights in rem of
creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific
assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time, belonging to the debtor
which are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings.

Rights in rem may include:

   - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds
of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

   - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the
claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

   - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of
them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

   - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

**_Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_**

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that
insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency
practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency
practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the extent that such
cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any
other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the group to
the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not
incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the
courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with the rules
applicable to them.

**GERMANY**

**_Insolvency_**

The Parent, the Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered
offices in Germany and, except for shareholding interests in certain subsidiaries, substantially all of their
assets are located in Germany. Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the Parent, the Issuer
and these certain Guarantors are likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the Parent, the Issuer and the
Guarantors, respectively, were held to have their center of main interests within the territory of Germany
pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation (see “—European Union”) at the time the application for the
opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most
likely govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in
Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German
law (for example, if the center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency
over the Parent, the Issuer or a German Guarantor may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws
of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be
as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority
of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority
recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability
of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes, as applicable, to an extent exceeding the limitations arising
under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency
proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the
relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency
proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a
group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a
group. In this context, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies
(Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018.
However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of
group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent


-----

group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims
amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies:
(i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a
single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination
obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and
(iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment
of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a
“coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited
to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment
of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the
opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also
below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims”.

Under German insolvency law, (preliminary) insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent
insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings. (Preliminary) Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a
creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is
unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the
value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going
concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering at least the next
twelve (12) months (positive Fortführungsprognose). Under the Act on the Temporary Adjustment of
Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate Crisis Effects (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden
_Anpassung sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtlicher Vorschriften zur Abmilderung von Krisenfolgen) (the_
“SanInsKG”), the forecast period relevant for the over-indebtedness test was reduced to four (4) months until
December 31, 2023. However, from 1 September 2023 onwards, management may need to take into account
that the reduction ceases to apply within the four-month period. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid
if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless
it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be
deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock
corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas
_Europaea—SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any_
company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder—such as the Issuer—becomes illiquid
and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders
are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, in the case of
illiquidity at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of over-indebtedness at
the latest within six (6) weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations
exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or
over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes, are voidable. In addition,
imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which
exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to
continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being
24 months). However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening
of insolvency proceedings in case of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit).

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the
court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless
the debtor has petitioned for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in
which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs
under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that, inter alia, the debtor has enclosed a
comprehensive (vollständig) and coherent (schlüssig) self-administration plan (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) to
the petition for the debtor-in-possession proceeding and no circumstances are known which indicate that the
key aspects of the self-administration plan are based on inaccurate facts.


-----

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a
preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for debtor in
possession proceedings or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to
suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. A preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss) must be set up if the debtor has satisfied in the previous business year two of the following_
three requirements: a balance sheet total of at least €6 million (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor
is over-indebted), sales of at least €12 million in the twelve months prior to the last balance sheet date and/or
fifty or more employees on an annual-average basis. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to
participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. For example, the preliminary creditors’committee
will have the ability to influence the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), court orders authorizing debtor-in-_
possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung) and appointment of a preliminary custodian
(vorläufiger Sachwalter). In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on
an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not
competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of
all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one
for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the
preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which
may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency
reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings.

The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse)_
to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be
sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors)
advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not necessarily,
the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court
unless a debtor in possession proceeding (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor in possession
proceeding, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor
passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to
change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly
(erste Gläubigerversammlung). Such change requires that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count
and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the new insolvency
administrator and (ii) the proposed individual is eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business
experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur
other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator
qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency
claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after
realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the Holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such
opening of formal insolvency proceedings against the Parent, the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their
relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

   - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to
administer and dispose of the assets of the Parent, the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant
subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole
representative of the insolvency estate;

   - if the court does not order debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the
Parent, the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the
management of the Parent, the Issuer, such Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening of
formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

   - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of the Parent’s, the Issuer’s, such Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’
property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and
void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and


-----

   - claims against the Parent, the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only
be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”entitling
one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the
opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of
reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder
_Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or_
not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights
applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

Any person who has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency
estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors
(Massegläubiger), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer
pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in
compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement
action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay
once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to
enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however,
secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the
security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency
administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right
to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens
over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as
to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen).In case the
enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain
contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the
secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% (or more in certain
circumstances) of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a
security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining
unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency
estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred
liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all
other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be
satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and
paid in full.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) or to separation (Aussonderungsrecht)
may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this
right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting
from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the
relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who
becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank
senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency
proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated
creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under
“—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims”.

It may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. While in
ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the Parent’s, the Issuer’s, any Guarantor’s or any of their relevant
subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s
business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken
based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency


-----

administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the Parent,
the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in
accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting
creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate
entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the
insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a
debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions
regarding the Notes, the guarantees or the collateral which are less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than
the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of the collateral, the
release of obligations under the Notes or the contribution of the Notes in exchange for equity. Under certain
conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected Holders of the Notes.

Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency
reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to
initiate such process based on a debtor in possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business
is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three months to
utilize an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During the respective period granted by the
court to prepare the insolvency plan, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the
filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian
(Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as
custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously
not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time
unless and until the insolvency administrator or, in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung), the debtor (with consent of the custodian (Sachwalter), if necessary, opt for performance.

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtorin-possession proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that
are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal
insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other
acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or
other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the
insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the
circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement
of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Parent, the Issuer, any
Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany,
the payment of any amounts to the Holders of the Notes as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing
credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an
insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the Holders of the
Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes or the Collateral and may participate
in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditors only. If payments have already been made under the
Notes or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid to
the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the Holders of the Notes, as applicable, would only have a
general unsecured claim under the Notes, as applicable, without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the
granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the
debtor may be voided pursuant to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the
following cases:

   - any legal act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for debt if such act was taken (i) during the last
three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided
that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of
such illiquidity (or of circumstances that compellingly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such
time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor
knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that compellingly
suggest such illiquidity or filing);


-----

- any legal act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for debt to which such creditor was not entitled, or which
was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to
such security or satisfaction, if such act was taken (i) during the last month prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) during the second or third
month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) during the
second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other
insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that compellingly suggest such detrimental
effect);

- a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a
debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to
the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the
time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such
time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the
counterparty to such legal transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the
time of the legal transaction;

- any performance (Leistung) rendered by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby
a debtor grants security for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings;

- any legal act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the
intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the
beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted
a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year
period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act”in terms of such provision
is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; if the relevant act_
granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to
such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminently illiquid”
(drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actually illiquid”
(eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit), so that the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act”is presumed
if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and
that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; if a creditor concluded a payment agreement
(Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms
(Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor
did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act.

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier
than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or if the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time
the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes,
subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners
and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the
debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the
foregoing persons;

- any legal act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security,
the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place
during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings
or after the filing of such petition; or

- any legal act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent
claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition


-----

for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had
granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or surety (Bürge) (in which case the
shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge”is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to
prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s
intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent
illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an
“affiliated party”, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge”.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the
Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden Aussetzung der
_Insolvenzantragspflicht und zur Begrenzung der Organhaftung bei einer durch die COVID-19-Pandemie_
_bedingten Insolvenz) (the “COVInsAG”), however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and_
shareholder loans under German insolvency law claw-back provisions during a certain time during the
COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party
financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors
if the relevant financing was granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the
requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision of
collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral
to secure the repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are
economically equivalent to a loan.

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction”
and may as such be privileged—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg) by not being subject to voidness rights.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement
order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant
security right according to the German Act on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency
proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods
are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims to
ensure that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial
distress to solve their problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings (Directive of the
European Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of
debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive Restructuring
**Directive”).**

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development
of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential
part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for
Enterprises (Gesetz über den Stabilisierungs- und Restrukturierungsrahmen) (the “Company Stabilization and
**Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in**
Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”)
are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent
restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in
cases in which a debtor faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), i.e., that there is the
imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course
of (regularly) the next 24 months.

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon
the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that
the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The
debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring


-----

Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective
requirements are met (see above under “—Insolvency”).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the
Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of
the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected
liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal
tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent
restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used
without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under
the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for
each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover
security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the
Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group
insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency”).

The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of
a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts,
interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including,
e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent
and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon
being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan, which
can be submitted solely by the debtor, will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan
requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan
(whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of
share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one
class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor
class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain legal requirements are met and the restructuring court
confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the
debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These
tools include a stabilization order, among other things, by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the
application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all
creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with
subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain
conditions being satisfied.

For the Holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the
Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act by the Parent, the Issuer, a German Guarantor or any other
Guarantor having its center of main interests in Germany would be the following:

   - The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or
only limited review and/or supervision by a court;

   - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period
of up to eight months due to a stabilization order;

   - any claims and rights of the Holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised
by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or
interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of
the ranking of the security right);

   - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring
Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

   - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any Holder of
the Notes without the consent of each Holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class
cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the Holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in
any Member State (other than Denmark) under the EU Insolvency Regulation since the German lawmaker


-----

decided to include public restructuring proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act
in Exhibit A of said Regulation. In any other case (i.e., a “private” proceeding), the recognition of a
restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.

**_Europe-wide Harmonization of Insolvency Law_**

The German insolvency laws may become subject to further amendment in the future. On December 7, 2022,
the European Commission published a “Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council harmonizing certain aspects of insolvency law” (COM(2022) 702 final), which seeks to advance the
further financial and economic integration in the European Union. The proposed Directive, inter alia,
proposes (i) detailed minimum requirements for avoidance actions; (ii) cross-border rights for the insolvency
courts or the insolvency practitioner, respectively, to access certain bank account and ownership registers for
the purpose of tracing the assets belonging to the insolvency estate (“asset tracing”); (iii) the introduction of
pre-pack proceedings intended to facilitate the sale of the debtor’s business or part thereof as a going concern;
(iv) a liability of the directors if they fail to comply with the obligation to file for opening of insolvency
proceedings; (v) simplified winding-up proceedings for insolvent microenterprises; (vi) minimum requirements
for the working methods, function, rights, duties, powers, expenses and remuneration and liability of creditors’
committees; and (vii) the obligation for each Member State to issue a key information factsheet written in
clear, non-technical and comprehensible language and containing essential information about such Member
State’s national insolvency law. While the proposed Directive is still at an early stage and will likely not be
adopted in its current draft version, it might affect German insolvency laws in the future and to an extent not
yet fully ascertainable.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the
claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred
by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines,
coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or
administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of
a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting
from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan, unless a state aid bank or any of its
subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the respective loan or legal
transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. The COVInsAG, however, suspends the statutory
subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings
applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans that were granted between
March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the
filing duties at the time.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

The granting of guarantees and/or Collateral by German Guarantors will be subject to certain German capital
maintenance rules of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die
_Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) (the “GmbHG”) if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in_
the legal form of a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—a “GmbH”) or
a German limited partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner (a “GmbH & Co.
**KG”). As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its**
shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability
reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would fall below the
amount of its stated share capital (Unterbilanz/Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees or security interests
granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect
parent or sister company are considered disbursements under sections 30 and 31 GmbHG. Moreover, under
section 15b paragraph 1 in connection with paragraph 5 German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung),
members of the representative body and liquidators of a legal person who are subject to the obligation to file
an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (antragspflichtige Mitglieder des Vertretungsorgans
_und Abwickler einer juristischen Person), e.g., a managing director (Geschäftsführer) of a GmbH, can be held_
personally liable in certain circumstances for payments to shareholders that, if made, would render the
respective person illiquid. The granting of guarantees and security interests for the benefit of direct or indirect


-----

parent or sister companies of such legal persons, e.g., a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG, could be considered to
constitute such disbursements and payments to shareholders.

In relation to a GmbH & Co. KG the capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules and principles
described above for GmbHs apply, mutatis mutandis, also to the general partners of the GmbH & Co. KGs.
Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to provide security interests to
secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating German capital
maintenance and/or liquidity maintenance rules and to limit any potential personal liability (as well as criminal
prosecution) of the management, it is standard market practice for notes, credit agreements, indentures, related
guarantees and related security documents to contain so called “limitation language”in relation to subsidiaries
incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation
language”, the beneficiaries of the guarantees contractually agree to enforce the guarantees and security
interests against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the
subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing
an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Guarantee Agreement, to the extent provided by a
Guarantor incorporated in Germany in a relevant corporate form as described above, contains or will contain
such contractual limitation language and such guarantees are limited in the manner described. This could
lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by such Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

German capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules are subject to court decisions on an ongoing
basis (see, for example, the more recent decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
dated March 21, 2017, file no. II ZR 93/16, regarding the preservation of the share capital). Future court
decisions may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of
a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the
Notes or of the German Guarantors to make payments on the related guarantees.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in which a
shareholder deprives its company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be
applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interests granted by the Parent,
the Issuer and a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement
process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof), a security or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of
contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the
debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It
cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees
and/or security interests to be granted by the Parent, the Issuer and the German Guarantors. Furthermore,
the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the
guarantee or the security interests could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The
German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the
creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the
debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if
the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee
or security interest was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect
thereto.

**_Accessory security interests/Parallel debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature and
are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the secured
claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically
lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently,
but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and
(iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest.

The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not
a creditor under the Notes. The Holders of the Notes on the other hand are creditors under the Notes and the
Guarantees. In order to allow the Holders of the Notes to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also
secure a so called “parallel debt”obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security
Agent rather than secure the Holders of the Notes’ claims under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the


-----

same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Parent, the Issuer and any Guarantor
under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal
Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will
discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the
parallel debt, a claim against the Holders of the Notes and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the
Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will
eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security
Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted.

Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the
Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully
claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the Holders of the Notes with respect to the
secured claims. As a consequence the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security
rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the security holder upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of
the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain
waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest
in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted
such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held
that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the
distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to
intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**FRANCE**

**_Insolvency_**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of any member
of the Group (including any French Guarantor) or its center of main interests within the meaning of
article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code is deemed to be in France, it could be subject to French
court-assisted proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall
within the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation). In addition, to the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to
be in France or it has an establishment in France or (ii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not
apply, its registered office or its main center of interests within the meaning of article R. 600-1 of the French
Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, they could also be subject to French court-administered
proceedings affecting creditors, i.e. either safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings
(sauvegarde and sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial
liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or
exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in net
turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in net turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with
respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency
Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its
main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with respect to the
member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French
courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined
above and to specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the
whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment
over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the
Notes Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests in the Collateral.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization and
judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Any company of our group having its center of main interests in France would be subject to


-----

French main insolvency proceedings and any company of our group having an establishment in France and
its center of main interests in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French
secondary insolvency proceedings.

Besides, in order to transpose the EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of
June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on
measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt,
and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency), was published (the
“Restructuring Directive”) on June 26, 2019 into French law, the French government issued:

(1) on September 15, 2021, ordinance no. 2021-1193 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective as from
October 1, 2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings
opened as of such date; and

(2) on September 23, 2021, decree no. 2021-1218 (the “2021 Decree”) for the implementation of the
2021 Ordinance.

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational
purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the
Notes.

**_Grace periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5
of the French Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings involving
the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position
and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment
dates of payment obligations that are due and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus
deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than
the legal rate, as published semi-annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be
allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will
suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment
will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the
course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see “Court-assisted Proceedings”
below).

**_Warning procedure (procédure d’alerte) by the statutory auditors and powers of the president of the commercial_**
**_court._**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for certain warning
procedures, which take place in stages. If a company is incorporated as a société anonyme, when there are
elements which the statutory auditor of the company believes place the company’s existence as a going concern
in jeopardy, it must request company management to provide an explanation for the situation (Stage 1 of the
warning procedure). Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures by management within 15 days
following the request, the statutory auditor must request that the board of directors (or the equivalent body)
be convened and may request to be heard by the president of the relevant commercial court (Stage 2 of the
warning procedure). The minutes of the board of directors’ meeting are sent to the employee representatives
during Stage 2, as Stage 1 proceedings are confidential.

If, despite the statutory auditor’s request, the board of directors (or an equivalent body) has not been
convened, if the statutory auditor has not been summoned to the meeting of the board, or if the statutory
auditor concludes that in the context of this meeting satisfactory explanations have not been given and
appropriate corrective measures have not been taken by management, then management must convene a
shareholders meeting at which the auditors present a special report on the state of the company. This report is
also sent to the employee representatives (Stage 3 of the warning procedure). In practice, the statutory auditor
commonly invites the management to convene a shareholders meeting. If management fails to act, then the
statutory auditor convenes the shareholders meeting himself/herself and sets the agenda. If the statutory
auditor considers that decisions made by the shareholders during the shareholders meeting do not ensure the
company’s existence as a going concern, he or she must inform the president of the relevant commercial court
of the warning procedure and may also request to be heard on the matter (Stage 4 of the warning procedure).


-----

Similar warning procedures exist for companies not registered as a société anonyme, with minor differences in
technical details of the procedure.

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee, or, in their absence, the
employees’ representatives have similar rights.

The 2021 Ordinance also removed the expiry date in respect of the measures created by the Covid Ordinance
to improve the early detection of difficulties by increasing the role of the statutory auditors.

Such measures provide that, if the auditors consider that the state of the relevant company requires immediate
action that management refuses to take or in respect of which management proposes to take action that the
statutory auditors deem insufficient, the auditors may inform the president of the relevant commercial court
concurrently with their initial report made to the director, the chairman of the board of directors (conseil
_d’administration) or of the supervisory board (conseil de surveillance), as the case may be._

In such a case, the statutory auditors, by any means and without delay, communicate their findings and
actions to the president of the court, and may provide copies of any relevant documents and explain the
reasons for which they considered that the actions of management were insufficient. They can also provide
the president of the court, on their own initiative or upon request, with any additional element to help
understand the economic and financial situation of the company.

The statutory auditors may also request to be heard, at any time, alongside the management, by the president
of the relevant commercial court.

The president of the relevant commercial court can also summon management to a meeting in order for them
to provide explanations on the measures they intend to take to address difficulties that could jeopardize the
company’s existence as a going concern. The president of the court may, concurrently with his summons to
management and without having to wait for their meeting, request from the auditors, the employee
representatives or public entities such as financial administrations, social security and unemployment
insurance organizations, any information providing a precise knowledge of the economic and financial
situation of the debtor. The President of the relevant commercial court also has the right to request the same
information in the event that management fails to file the company’s financial statements within the applicable
legal deadlines and within the month of his injunction to do so.

**_Insolvency test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is unable
to pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif disponible) taking into account
available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court ruling
commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier
date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the
date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an
agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the
beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte) (see below).

**_Court-assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court-assisted
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main
creditors and stakeholders e.g. an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice, mandat_
_ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see_
“—Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of
the court decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out
under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor
itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties
of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints
him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors
will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot
be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any
pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their


-----

claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their
duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “Grace periods”above). The agreement reached is reported to the
president of the court but is not formally approved by it.

_Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties_
of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency test” above) or has not been
insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of
the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, the disclosure of the court decision
approving (homologation) the conciliation agreement or in case of commencement of an insolvency
proceedings within 18 months following such court-assisted proceedings, where the court can request to have
access to all documents exchanged during the conciliation procedure and the content of the agreement, which
will however not be communicated to third parties, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a courtappointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision
of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum
of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute
maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué)
or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the
hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of
the president of the court or the court itself.

The duties of the conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its
creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g. providing for the restructuring of its
indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely
consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor
forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors
are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted
to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration and creditors may not request the
opening of insolvency proceedings (judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation
(liquidation judiciaire)) against the debtor for the duration of the conciliation proceedings.

Pursuant to article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the
right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period of up to two years in accordance with
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “Grace periods” above) provided that a creditor has formally put
the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment, or has refused the conciliator’s request to suspend the
enforceability of its claim (suspendre l’exigibilité de sa créance). In the latter case, the judge may also reschedule
for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. the payment of claims not yet due; the judge will take its
decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to
reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings. A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously
granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit
from grace periods so granted by the judge.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of
the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, subject to certain conditions being met, which makes the
agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action
by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation
agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation
proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the
request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee
representatives, as the case may be, must be convened—if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation
agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively
ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair
the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement
(constatation) as described above and, in addition:

   - the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose the
amount of any Conciliation Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to
secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except
vis-à-vis the works council or


-----

   - employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may
have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court;

   - persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services
designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing
new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all precommencement and post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including with
respect to certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural
costs) (the “Conciliation Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

   - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien may not, without their
holders’ consent, be rescheduled or written off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan and their
payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or
reorganization plan is adopted, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the
event that classes of affected parties are formed);

   - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to
its statutory auditors; and

   - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings,
the date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency test” above), and therefore the starting date of the
hardening period (as defined below, see “—Hardening Period (Période Suspecte)”), cannot be set by
the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the
court (except in case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor,
appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord)
during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:

   - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

   - in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor retains the right
to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings to impose grace periods on
creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social
security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment
of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after
hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement
and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and

   - in accordance with Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code, a joint-debtor or a third
party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to
the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as
from grace periods granted to the debtor during the execution of the conciliation agreement
pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code mentioned above.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of
the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its
termination. Termination will however not extend to the provisions of the conciliation agreement addressing
the consequences of such termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the
conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed,
any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the
conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent insolvency
proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will
recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing security interests or
guarantees.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the
matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of
the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the disposal of the business”, also known as a prepack sale plan
(plan de cession) which could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization
or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this


-----

context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of
safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings after consultation of the State prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an
ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the
designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request
submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad
hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the
professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being
reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any
specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of
insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as
from the end of the previous ones.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see
“—Insolvency test” above).

If the court finds that the debtor does not face difficulties that it is not able to overcome, it invites the debtor
to request the initiation of conciliation proceedings before the President of the Court.

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the
commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the court
decision commencing the proceedings. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a courtappointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is (except for small companies where the court considers
that such appointment is not necessary) appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an
“observation period” (being the period from the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings to
the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to
12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft
safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors (or submit to the classes of
affected parties—see below) that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equity holders do not
have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the courtappointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the
judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (“mission de
_surveillance”) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (“mission d’assistance”),_
all under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a creditors representative
(mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed
administrator. Management decisions in respect of disposals (acte de disposition) that fall outside the scope of
the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions considered to be important under statute, require the
prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes).

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’_
representative or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert
the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at
any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) in case no plan has been adopted by the
classes of affected parties (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible
and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial
liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is
manifestly impossible. In all such cases, the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor or on its own initiative with the exception
of (i) (b) where:

(i) the court may not act upon its own initiative;

(ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator,
the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller
(contrôleurs) if any, the Public Prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).


-----

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes
immediately due and payable.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement
of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the
proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor,
is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior
debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or
to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

_Judicial Restructuring Lien: Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard or judicial_
reorganization or liquidation proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the
“Judicial Restructuring Lien”):

(i) during the observation period in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings or the temporary
continuation of business in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the continuity of the
debtor’s business during this period, in which case such financing must be authorized by the
supervisory judge and are subject to publicity, or

(ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the
court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege must
be specifically mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote as
well as in the court decision adopting the plan,

enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the exception of
(i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the Conciliation Lien (iv) pre-commencement
claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of judicial liquidation
proceedings) and (v) post-commencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages guarantee
scheme (AGS) under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Labor Code.

The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to
commencement of the proceedings.

In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan
(although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without the
consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that
classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings.

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard
plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the
court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

If no draft safeguard plan is presented in a timely manner, the State Prosecutor, any creditor, the courtappointed administrator or the creditors’ representative may request the court to terminate the safeguard
proceedings after having heard the debtor.

_Standard Consultation_

This applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the proceedings (on
a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of
Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have less than (x) 250 employees and
€20 million in net turnover or (y) €40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge
authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors.

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed
creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt
write-offs and payment times proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to
legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that
it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’
representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment


-----

of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan
(ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses operated by individuals where the maximum is
fifteen years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan
is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors which do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than
debt-for-equity-swap) made to them in writing are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative
keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator
and the controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that_
were submitted to them (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the
Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the
maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court,
in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap
may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Creditors who benefit from a Judicial Restructuring Lien, may not be imposed any debt rescheduling or other
restructuring measure.

The court will approve the plan when there is a serious possibility for the turnaround of the debtor.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at
least 5% of the total amount of the debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each annual
instalment must be of at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following
the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case
the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in
accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the
shareholders’ general meeting and, as the case may be, the shareholders’ special meetings or the general
meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time
the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or
represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second
time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply.

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share
capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be
reduced according to the provisions of the plan).

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent.
The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification
is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are
consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties
shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall
constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps.

The debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the employees’ representatives
(or workers’council) and the Public Prosecutor may lodge an appeal before the court of appeal or as applicable
the French supreme court (Cour de cassation) against the decision approving or rejecting the safeguard plan.

Creditors may lodge a third-party opposition (tierce-opposition) only where: (a) the approved plan defrauded
their rights; or (b) if they can invoke a “proper argument” (‘un moyen propre’).

_Class-Based Consultation_

This applies to large companies, that, on the date of the petition for commencement of the proceedings, meet
or exceed either of the following thresholds (x) 250 employees and €20 million in net turnover or (y) €40 million
in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the


-----

meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), or upon the debtor’s request and
with the authorization of the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the
assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties
_affectées), as defined below._

Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan. Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French
Commercial Code, affected parties are:

i. creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan

ii. (equity holders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share
capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are
modified by the proposed plan.

The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected
party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective
verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes presenting a sufficient commonality of economic
interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following conditions:

i. creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of the
claims so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes;

ii. the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before commencement
of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator
within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its membership in a class;

iii. equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and

iv. claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme (AGS)
claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of
creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims
that are not secured by such security trust is taken into account.

The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and for
the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them to cast a
vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor and certified
by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered certified accountant. Future
interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to the value of the index at the
date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust
(fiducie) shall only be taken into account for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust.

Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the court-appointed
administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of the
classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute the same
before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing
that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such
later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be
appealed within five days of its notification to the parties.

The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity
swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or
the Judicial Restructuring Lien).

The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties
concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed
judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree.

The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended
or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator,
but may not be shorter than 15 days.

The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members casting a
vote.


-----

If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at shareholders/equity
holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds majority.

Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the commercial court
which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met:

i. the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the rules mentioned above;

ii. affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated equally
and in proportion to their claim or right;

iii. the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties;

iv. if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e. no
dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of
payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a courtordered sale plan (plan de cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the plan was not
approved);

v. where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively
impair the interests of the affected parties; and

vi. the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected.

The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s
insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders the plan
enforceable against all (erga omnes) (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the
adoption of the plan).

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the
shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their
admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan).

_Cross-class cram-down_

The 2021 Ordinance has introduced a cross-class cram-down mechanism into French law: where the safeguard
plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be adopted by the court at the request of
the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the
parties that voted against the plan provided that:

(a) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above;

(b) the plan has been approved by:

i. a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at least one such class
is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles) or is
senior to the unsecured creditors’ class (créanciers chirographaires); or, if such condition is not
met,

ii. at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than an equity holders’ class
or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could
reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment if the order of priority of payments in
a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered
sale plan (plan de cession));

(c) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or equivalent
means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e.,
absolute priority rule);

(d) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total amount of its
claims or interests;

(e) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the plan,
the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if:

i. the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold or control,


-----

within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) meets
or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250 employees and €20 million of net turnover
or (y) €40 million in net turnover;

ii. it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that
the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or
retain any interest if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied
(whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession));

iii. if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or by way of set off
of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders, pro rata their
shareholding; and

iv. the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or
classes of equity holders.

The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of the
equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may appoint a
judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes.

Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent, the court
can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s objectives and if the plan
does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In particular, supplier claims, equity
holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption.

As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a timeperiod during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor
may not be disposed of without court’s consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court shall, at the request of
the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public
prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the
adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead
the debtor to shortly becoming insolvent.

At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted
against the draft plan and considering that:

(a) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or

(b) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the debtor
as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met:

i. in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was not an
equity holder, such class would not have been entitled to a payment if the order of payment in
a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered
sale plan);

ii. in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, such class(es)
would not have received a payment or retained an interest in the event that the order of payment
applicable in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or of
a court-ordered sale plan),

may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s
opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court
is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions
and on the adoption of the plan.

This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by the
affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor.

In the event no plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by approval by the
classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French courts to
impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting


-----

creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard
consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed or, in judicial reorganization proceedings only, in case of
failure of the class-based consultation).

_Specific Case—Creditors that are Public Institutions_

Public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may
agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal
market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also
decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests.
Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee
(Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes.
As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims, the
administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties called
upon to vote on the proposed plan.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard_**

A debtor which is the subject of conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) enabling it to implement a restructuring plan in an
expedited fashion through a class-based consultation.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings regime is broadly applicable to accelerated
safeguard. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to the
recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings, notably due to
accelerated timing.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill the following conditions:

   - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

   - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

   - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a
position to overcome;

   - its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or
drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable);

   - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a
going concern that is likely to be supported by enough of the parties that will be impaired to render
its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period, that may be extended up to a total
maximum of four months, following commencement of the accelerated safeguard proceedings, upon
request from the debtor and the court-appointed administrator.

The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its financial
creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such creditors alone.

If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditor classes (see above) to be formed, the
court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings.

The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority rules as
in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion
of debt into equity capital of the debtor.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court
shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the
class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be
deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the
creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).


-----

**_Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may
be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only, if the
debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming
insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to
civil liability if they knowingly fail to do so.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may
order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would
apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered
that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the
safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the State prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard
proceedings into reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was
already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is
only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the
controllers, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any).

Judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation may also be initiated by a creditor or by the public prosecutor,
provided that conciliation proceedings are not underway.

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of
employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of
share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of reorganization, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court
to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (instead
of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the reorganization
of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a reorganization plan, which is similar to a safeguard plan),
or the sale of all or part of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator
will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the
court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration).

Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings
(see above), subject to certain specificities.

Differences exist under judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of class formation and the adoption of
the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows:

i. the plan is prepared by the court-appointed administrator, not by the debtor;

ii. if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected
parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator on
their own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor);

iii. any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan shall be
submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of the
vote;

iv. if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share
transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void;

v. if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, the court can decide to apply the
cross-class cram-down mechanism at the request of any affected party (in addition to the debtor or
the administrator with the debtor’s consent); and

vi. in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by regular
approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down) fails the approval of the
plan may occur through the standard consultation rules (see above).


-----

In relation to equity holders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization
proceedings:

i. in case a shareholders meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders equity to a level equal to at
least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code,
the court-appointed administrator may request the appointment a court officer (mandataire de
_justice) to convene a shareholders meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up_
to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that
refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification
of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan;

ii. if (i) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the
French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the
disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional
economy and to local employment, (iii) the modification of the debtor company’s share capital
appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow
the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the courtappointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or
partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision
commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the
modification of the debtor company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan
have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either:

      - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the
share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount
provided for in the reorganization plan; or

      - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale
of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital
increase and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a
majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or
a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings, any consent clause being deemed
unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request
that their shares be purchased by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties,
be set by an expert appointed by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders
to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the
reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial
sale of the business as part of a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession).

At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative,
order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its
reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings
is decided by the court:

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is
generally the former creditors’representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial
liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial
liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the
liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the
liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment). The liquidator
will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in
charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which are
decided by the court without a vote of the creditors:


-----

   - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period
of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and
organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de
_cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid_
on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party
purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the
liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including
the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their going-concern market
value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan that ensures the continuation of the business
as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors.

   - Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including
secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating
to release their security interests. By way of exception:

i. a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having
granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included
in the sale of the business plan;

ii. the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the
outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased
asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and

iii. only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges
over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets)
would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right
(and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured
or unless an agreement is reached with the relevant parties.

   - Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of
several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in
different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred
assets could be significantly less than their going-concern market value; or

   - separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

i. launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only);

ii. sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers
have been received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to
conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or

iii. request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to
bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the
bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed
before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However the possibility to implement such
process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

If the court orders a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to
the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to
pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due
to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

   - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the
difficulty of selling the assets;

   - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in
charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits
between the remaining creditors.


-----

_The Hardening Period (période suspecte)_

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is determined in the court order commencing the
insolvency proceedings. Failing this, the date of insolvency is deemed to be the date of such court decision.
The court may in any case reconsider the same at a later stage and set an earlier date, which may be no earlier
than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may
not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation)
in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the
beginning of the “période suspecte” (hardening period), being the period from the insolvency date of the
debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court.

   - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening
period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment
of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no or for nominal consideration, contracts
under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other
party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not
commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments
ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary
measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts
previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent nature
and base and with the exception of the assignment of a professional receivables (Dailly assignment)
made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency),
provisional attachment or seizure measures (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of
insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust
arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred),
any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in
the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and a declaration of non-seizability
(déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code.

   - Transactions which are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due,
transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers
_détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in each_
case if the court determines that the creditor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time.
Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of
exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the
French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to
the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set
aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate
to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”.

In addition to the above, any transfer of assets for no consideration can be voided if done during the 6-month
period preceding the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings.

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation_**
**_Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the safeguard or insolvency proceedings
triggers the acceleration of the debt (noting that, with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the
court does not order the continued operation of the business, unmatured debts will become immediately due
and payable) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor.
Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the
_rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (in_
accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case
law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed
administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the
debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that
other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in
default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations
(and provided that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the


-----

debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically
accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the
business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) (which it may do
for a period of three months, renewable once); in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur
on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the
continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

   - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of
contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest
can no longer be compounded);

   - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and
payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets (whether they be
pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust
estate (patrimoine fiduciaire) for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the
business);

   - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings,
unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in
consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; security interests can be granted as
regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the
insolvency judge;

   - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/
goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not,
will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with
certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring
Lien), provided that they have been notified to the administrator within one year of the expiry of
the observation period; and

   - creditors (or beneficiaries of a third party security granted by the debtor) may not pursue any
individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a
natural person and the proceedings are safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings) with respect
to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such
legal action is:

i. to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the
creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as
described below);

ii. to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed to the creditor; or

iii. to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure
third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific
process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such
asset-whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable-is located in another Member State
within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be
affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation (subject to secondary proceedings that may be commenced in such
Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France
and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be
recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in
a treaty to which France is a party); and

   - any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any
means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of
securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is
prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of
the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held
unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in


-----

the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of
professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement entered into before
commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French
Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code
or the French Insurance Code and

   - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of
payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat
_en cours), will be required._

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan or
of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court.

In accelerated safeguard, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the
proceedings (see above). Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to
be payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement
of proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the
publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales);
this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim
for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred
to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors on whose behalf no claims have been submitted
during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in
connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors
under French law.

In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party
must also file a statement of claim with the creditors representative under the same conditions.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the creditors’
representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the
creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a
filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify
or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the
claim. They may also file their own proofs of claim.

In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having
taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although
such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this
simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared
by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors which did not take part in the
conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors
included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization
or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its
creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the
debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former creditor’s representative) in charge of selling the
assets of the debtor and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice,
where the sale of the business is considered, the court will usually appoint a court-appointed administrator to
manage the debtor during the temporary continuation of the business operations (see above) and to organize
the sale of the business process.

If the court orders a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation
proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors
according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the
liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their
ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a
Conciliation Lien (see above), post-commencement creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges).
In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose


-----

claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement creditors. This order of priority does not
apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets
with respect to their claim related to such asset.

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes
immediately due and payable.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held
liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was
wrongful, in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) interference with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or
guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or
guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can
be canceled or reduced by the court.

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the debtor’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of
such debtor (dirigeant de fait). Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if judicial
liquidation proceedings have been commenced against the debtor, a de facto manager may be liable for bearing
the excess of liabilities over the debtor company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de
_facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement contributed to the debtor’s shortfall of_
assets.

If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the
shortfall amount. The mere negligence of a de jure or de facto manager in the management of the debtor is
not sufficient to hold a manager liable for the debtor’s shortfall of assets.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

   - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited
financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or
infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial
Code; and

   - French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another
company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee
unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient
return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of
a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the
benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder will
be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly
or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly
on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements
and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee in respect of the
obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans
due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to
above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Notes Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may effectively have
no obligation under its Notes Guarantee.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the Note Guarantee, an economic return that
is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an
arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length
transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.


-----

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral_**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained,
through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the
Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the
Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it
should be noted that the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any
of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company
(société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement
_de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will_
be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres
_financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be_
registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de
_mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests_
which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance
can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (soulte)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and
unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of
a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being
paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed
extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the
context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual
foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be
required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities
as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining
amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled
by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the
acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

**_Security Agent_**

Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal
guarantees by the security agent, which in its own name for the benefit of the creditors, and the security agent
will hold such rights in a dedicated estate separate from its own estate. As a result, the rights of secured
creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject
of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de
_suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the_
performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests
and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security
agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its
duties and its powers.

**_Parallel Debt—Trust_**

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents.
In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be provided
for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring


-----

the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes
under or in connection with the Conditions of Issue (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all
times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in
respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel
Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the
Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure
the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the
Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms
(Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New
York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of
claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French
Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did
not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on
the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the
Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and
academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no
assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted
that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to
generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this
matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general
recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt
claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability
under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel
Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests
in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges_

In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over
securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the
priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered.

**_Fraudulent conveyance_**

French law contains specific, “action paulienne” provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant
to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or
provides security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements
benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged (i) in insolvency
proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner
of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), or (ii) by any of the creditors of
the relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of
recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings.

Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act
without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings)
any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal
act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that
one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery
(where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the
counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests
in the Collateral, or the granting of a Note Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify
for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in


-----

the Collateral or the granting of such Note Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties
or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result
of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Note
Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the
Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Note Guarantees could
also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In
addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by
prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_**

To the best of our knowledge, there is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the
French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement
such as the Intercreditor Agreement, except for (i) in the context of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or judicial
reorganization proceedings, article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code which requires that affected
parties should bring subordination agreements entered into prior to the opening of such proceedings to the
attention of the court-appointed administrator and that the allocation of affected parties within the different
classes of creditors shall respect such subordination agreements, and (ii) article L. 626-30 and L. 628-7 of the
French Commercial Code, which provides that, under accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor should
provide the commercial court with a list of claims held by the creditors which participated in the negotiation
of the safeguard plan within the context of the conciliation proceedings that preceded the opening of such
accelerated safeguard proceedings, including details of subordination agreements of whose existence the
debtor is aware.

As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**ITALY**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special
provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved
activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public companies
are involved. In Italy, the courts play a central role in the insolvency process and in-court procedures may be
materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders
of the Notes may be familiar.

Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In
particular, on the Official Gazette No. 38 of February 14, 2019, Italian Legislative Decree No. 14 of
January 12, 2019 (the “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency” or the “Insolvency Code”), as further amended
and supplemented, which implemented the Italian Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017 and substantially
replaced the Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), was published.

The main amendments of the Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankruptcy”
(fallimento) due to its negative connotation and its replacement with a reference to a judicial liquidation
(liquidazione giudiziale), (ii) the introduction of a definition of state of crisis (stato di crisi), (iii) the adoption
of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different
restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società) originally
provided for by the Insolvency Code, (iv) a new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (v) the
introduction of restrictions relating to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato
_preventivo) in order to favor going-concern restructurings, (vi) a new crisis settlement procedure (composizione_
_negoziata della crisi), (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors, (viii) the_
adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning
group restructurings, (ix) the introduction of the new restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di_
_regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società); (x) the regulation of adequate measures and plans to_
early detect a crisis with specific criteria to be adopted by companies and (xi) amendments to certain
provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform provided by the
Insolvency Code. The Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the
Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020; (ii) the Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022
(iii) Legislative Decree No. 118 August 24, 2021; (iv) Legislative Decree No. 36 of April 30, 2022, and
(v) Legislative Decree No. 73 June 21, 2022. The Insolvency Code is now effective starting from July 15, 2022.


-----

Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain main aspects of insolvency law in Italy as
it stands now.

**_Italian laws (including Insolvency Code)_**

Below is a brief description of the main provisions of the following type of proceedings provided under
Insolvency Code which, after the entry into force of the latter (on 15 July 2022), has superseded the Italian
Bankruptcy Law:

   - judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) under the Insolvency Code;

   - composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) under the Insolvency Code;

   - negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) under the
Insolvency Code;

   - simplified composition with creditors proceeding (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio) under the Insolvency Code;_

   - certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) under the Insolvency Code;

   - debt-restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) under the Insolvency Code;

   - restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti a omologazione) under
the Insolvency Code.

The abovementioned restructuring/insolvency tools are available under Insolvency Code for insolvent
companies or a debtor in a state of crisis, as the case may be, and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing
an economic or financial imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their
insolvency will occur.

For the sake of completeness, please note that the Insolvency Code also provides for a simplified courtsupervised composition with creditors (concordato minore) in case the debtor does not meet the dimensional
requirements to access other restructuring tools, which follows the main procedural steps and effects provided
for the composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), but entails the involvement and the
assistance to the debtor of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi).

Furthermore, please find below a brief summary of the following proceedings, which remain available to
large companies also in the context of the new rules provided under the reform process:

   - extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle
_grandi imprese insolventi), under the Decree 270; and_

   - extraordinary administration for the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies
(amministrazione straordinaria per la ristrutturazione industriale delle grandi imprese insolventi), under
the Decree 347. For businesses performing essential public services, this type of proceedings would
also be subject to the Decree 134.

Please also find below a brief description of the forced administrative liquidation procedure (procedura di
_liquidazione coatta amministrativa)._

**_Definition of “insolvency” and “crisis” under the Insolvency Code_**

The Insolvency Code introduced a specific concept of crisis, which is defined under article 2, letter (a) of the
Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested
by the inadequacy of prospective cash flows to meet obligations in the following 12 (twelve) months.

Insolvency is defined under article 2, letter (b) of the Insolvency Code as the inability of the debtor to regularly
meet its obligations as they fall due, evidenced by defaults and/or other external elements.

Both insolvency and crisis are factual situations upon the occurrence of which different instruments provided
for by the Insolvency Code may be activated.

**_Judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) under the Insolvency Code_**

The judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) pursuant to the Insolvency Code is a court-supervised
procedure aimed at the liquidation of the insolvent company’s assets and for the distribution of the related


-----

proceeds. Pursuant to the Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation is declared by the competent court and is
applicable recurring two requirements:

i. an objective requirement, which is met if any of the following thresholds are met: (a) annual balance
sheet assets (attivo patrimoniale) greater than €300,000 in the last three financial years (from the date
on which the petition for judicial liquidation was filed) or from the establishment of the company if
it has been incorporated less than three years before the petition for judicial liquidation; (b) annual
gross proceeds (ricavi lordi) greater than €200,000 over the last three financial years (from the date
on which the petition for judicial liquidation was filed) or from the establishment of the company if
it has been incorporated less than three years before the petition for judicial liquidation; or
(c) indebtedness (including debt that is not overdue and payable) greater than €500,000; and

ii. a subjective requirement, which is met when the debtor is a commercial enterprise (imprenditore
_commerciale) carrying out commercial activity and is “insolvent”._

The judicial liquidation is opened and declared by the competent courts upon a specific petition that can be
filed by (i) the debtor itself; (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that have control and supervisory
functions over the company; (iii) one or more creditors; and (iv) in certain cases, the public prosecutor.

Upon opening the judicial liquidation proceeding, the courts (inter alia) appoint a receiver and the debtor
loses control over all its assets and over the management of its business which is taken over by the courtappointed receiver.

As a general rule, starting from the opening date of the judicial liquidation, stay of actions applies and no
enforcement and interim proceedings can be brought or continued against the debtor over the assets included
in the debtor’s estate. Specific exceptions by operation of law apply for certain claims secured by mortgages,
pledges or guarantees among which, inter alia:

i. mortgages securing loans pursuant to articles 38 and following of Italian Consolidated Banking
Law (so-called “mutuo fondiario”): such mortgages may be enforced by the lender also after the
opening of judicial liquidation vis-à-vis the debtor;

ii. pledges pursuant to Decree 170 (so-called «financial pledge» (pegno finanziario)): upon occurrence
of an enforcement event, the relevant secured creditor may immediately sell the pledged financial
assets and retain an amount equal to the secured obligations, even if an insolvency proceeding has
been opened;

iii. pledges over movable assets: creditors secured by pledges over movable assets of the debtor may be
authorized to sell the pledged assets during the procedure, after admission to the statement of
liabilities (ammissione allo stato passivo) with secured ranking;

iv. third-parties guarantees: even after the opening of judicial liquidation, creditors may decide to
enforce any guarantees (and/or security interest) granted by third-parties in the interest of the
bankrupt debtor.

Upon the opening of the judicial liquidation, inter alia:

i. subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within
a defined period;

ii. the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the receiver.
The debtor may no longer validly act in court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets and
the receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However, all
pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the
opening of the judicial liquidation and need to be re-initiated by or against the receiver;

iii. continuation of business may be authorized by the court, but only if the continuation of the
company’s business does not cause damage to creditors. If the court authorizes the continuation of
the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa), the management is entrusted to the receiver (who
may in turn avail himself of qualified third parties for this purpose);

iv. any act (including payments, pledges and issuances of guarantees) made by the debtor, other than
those made through the receiver, after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time)
the opening of judicial liquidation becomes (or could become if made before) ineffective against
creditors and/or can be clawed-back; and


-----

v. the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the opening of the
judicial liquidation are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the
general rule is that the receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all
of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific
rules expressly provided for the Insolvency Code. In order to overcome the uncertainty that may
predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition requiring the Court to give
the receiver a deadline of no more than 60 (sixty) days; within such deadline, the receiver must
decide to maintain the agreement in place or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline
without the receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed
terminated.

As far as receivables vis-à-vis the judicial liquidation proceedings are concerned, each creditor must lodge his
claims with the competent court. The filing of the proof of claim by the creditor is necessary to demonstrate
the creditor’s right to participate in the liquidation, the amount of its claim and its ranking. The judge
delegated by the court (giudice delegato), upon proposal of the receiver, will decide which claims are admitted
to the statement of liabilities (stato passivo), for which amount they are admitted and whether the claims are
to be qualified as secured of not. Each creditor may challenge (opposizione) the decision of the judge in front
of the court. The same procedure applies also to individuals and entities claiming the right to obtain the
restitution of assets. The sale of the debtor’s assets is carried out by the receiver—or the delegated judge—
through public auctions in compliance with a liquidation program proposed by the receiver and approved by
the creditors’ committee. Creditors are then repaid out of the proceeds of the liquidation, which is managed
by the receiver, according to the principle of equal treatment of creditors (so-called par condicio creditorum)
and in line with the statutory order of priority among creditors.

In addition to the above, please note that upon opening of the judicial liquidation, certain acts, payments,
guarantees or security interests can be declared ineffective and/or clawed-back under the Insolvency Code.
Transactions which may be set aside through a bankruptcy claw-back action under article 166 of the
Insolvency Code can be divided into two categories:

i. transactions which may be set aside by the receiver, unless the other party proves that it was not
aware of the insolvency of the debtor (article 166, para. 1 of the Insolvency Code) and, in particular:

a) transactions at an undervalue, carried out after the filing of the judicial liquidation petition
followed by the opening of the relevant proceeding or in the previous year (such term is
extended to 2 (two) years for intercompany transactions);

b) repayment of a debt by means other than money or other common methods of payment after
the filing of the petition the judicial liquidation followed by the opening of the relevant
proceeding or in the previous year (such term is extended to 2 years for intercompany
transactions);

c) pledges and voluntary mortgages created in the year preceding the filing of the judicial
liquidation petition to secure pre-existing debts not yet overdue;

d) pledges and judicial or voluntary mortgages created after the filing of the judicial liquidation
petition followed by the opening of the relevant proceeding or in the prior 6 (six) months (such
term is extended to 1 (one) year for intercompany transactions);

ii. transactions carried out after the filing of the judicial liquidation petition followed by the opening
of the relevant proceeding or in the prior 6 (six) months, which may be set aside if the receiver proves
that the other party was aware of the insolvency of the debtor (article 166, para. 2 of the Insolvency
Code) and, in particular:

a) payments of debts due and payable;

b) transactions for valuable consideration;

c) transactions creating priority rights/security interests relating to debts simultaneously incurred.

In addition to the above, under article 166 para. 3 of the Insolvency Code, the following transactions are
exempt from clawback actions:

i. payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice;

ii. remittances on a bank account (rimess effettuate su un conto corrente bancario), provided that they
do not materially and permanently reduce the entity’s debt towards the bank;


-----

iii. the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil
Code, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main
residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within 3 (three) degrees of kinship) or a nonresidential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided
that, as at the date of the opening of the judicial liquidation proceedings, the activity is actually
exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out
therein;

iv. transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the debtor’s goods,
provided that they concern the implementation of a certified restructuring plan (piano attestato di
_risanamento) pursuant to articles 56 or 284 of the Insolvency Code;_

v. a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in the context of
a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), of a restructuring plan subject to
homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) provided under article 64-bis
of the Insolvency Code or of homologated debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati) and/or transactions entered into, payments made and security_
interests legitimately granted by the debtor after the filing of the application for a composition with
creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) or of a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti). The exemption also operates for the ordinary claw-back;_

vi. remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by
them; and

vii. payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to a restructuring and insolvency tools provided for pursuant to the
Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to article 170 of the Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating claw-back action
proceedings is 3 (three) years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if earlier, 5 (five) years
from the act or transaction to be clawed back. In case a judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a
petition for other kind of insolvency proceedings, according to article 170, paragraph 2 of the Insolvency
Code, the hardening period is calculated backward from the date on which such petition was filed.

Under article 165 of the Insolvency Code, which recalls article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which in turn
provides for a general and ordinary clawback action (revocatoria ordinaria) that may be brought against the
debtor (and its counterparty) also in case no judicial liquidation proceedings are pending), acts by which the
debtor disposes of its assets (other than payments of due and payable amounts) may be clawed back if the
receiver can prove that the debtor was aware of the prejudice that such act would cause to its creditors
(including future creditors, to the extent that the act was made in order to create such prejudice) and, to the
extent that the act was non-gratuitous act, the counterparty was aware of such prejudice.

In addition, pursuant to article 163 of the Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exception, all
transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor
after the filing of the judicial liquidation petition to the relevant court followed by the opening of relevant
procedure or within the 2 (two) years preceding the opening of such proceeding. Any asset subject to a
transaction which is ineffective pursuant to article 163 of the Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation
estate by operation of law upon registration of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding
(trascrizione della sentenza che ha dichiarato l’apertura della procedura concorsuale), without the need of
waiting for the ineffectiveness of the transaction declared by a court. Any interested person may challenge the
registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law.

Moreover, under article 164 of the Insolvency Code, inter alia, are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors:

i. payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the declaration of opening of the judicial
liquidation or after such date, if carried out by the debtor after the filing of the judicial liquidation
petition followed by the opening of the insolvency proceeding or in the prior 2 (two) years period;
and

ii. payments made by the debtor with respect to any shareholder’s loan, if carried out by the debtor
after the filing of the of the judicial liquidation petition followed by the opening of the insolvency
proceeding or in the previous year.

The Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group transactions.
More specifically, under article 290 of the Insolvency Code the limitation period of initiating intra-group


-----

claw-back actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group
having the effect of shifting resources to another group company to the detriment of creditors, save for certain
exceptions) is 5 (five) years from the judicial liquidation filing petition.

Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law 132/2015) provides for a “simplified” claw-back
action with reference to certain types of transactions carried out by the debtor without consideration and
with the aim to subtract registered assets from the attachment by its creditors. The creditor can start
enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a court decision clawing back/
nullifying the relevant fraudulent transaction. In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also
be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the debtor’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of
priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities
of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a
consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor
contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the extent
they are inconsistent with the mandatory priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims
that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire debtor’s estate or
part thereof, or from a single asset. Pursuant to article 221 of the Insolvency Code, inter alia, proceeds of
liquidation of the assets shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of super-senior
claims (crediti prededucibili) including, inter alia, claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs
related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors;
(iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims (creditori chirografari).

Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of
preferential creditors, including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue
or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims
for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured
creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided
for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari), pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors
(crediti chirografari).

**_Bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale)_**

Pursuant to article 240 of the Insolvency Code, a judicial liquidation proceedings can terminate prior to
liquidation through a bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella liquidazione
_giudiziale), provided that certain requirements are met. The relevant petition may be filed by one or more_
creditors or third parties after the opening of the judicial liquidation and also before the issuance of the
decree declaring the effectiveness of the statement of liabilities (decreto che rende esecutivo lo stato passivo),
provided that, on the basis of the accounting data and the other information available, the receiver can draft
a provisional list of creditors for approval by the delegated judge, provided that debtors (or their subsidiaries
or companies under common control) are allowed to file such proposal only after 1 (one) year following the
judgement by virtue of which the judicial liquidation has been opened but within 2 (two) years from the
decree declaring the effectiveness of the statement of liabilities (decreto che rende esecutivo lo stato passivo)
and that the proposal provides for the granting of resources that increase the value of the assets of at least
10% (ten per cent.).

The proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, be then approved by the creditors and finally by the
court. In case the court’s decree approving the bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato
_nella liquidazione giudiziale) becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the judicial liquidation to be closed_
and terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors
(concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale). In the context of a bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors
(concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale), the competent court supervises both the proposal and execution
phases while the judicial receiver, once the liquidation is closed, loses his management functions and retains
only supervisory duties over the fulfillment of the terms and the conditions of the arrangement obligations
arising from or in connection with the bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella
_liquidazione giudiziale)._

i. The proposal may provide for:

ii. the subdivision of creditors into different classes according to homogeneous legal position and
economic interests;


-----

iii. differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of such
differences;

iv. debts’ rescheduling and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner, including, by way of
example, by assignment of assets, assumption (accollo) as well as by means of other extraordinary
transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to companies in which they have an
interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible into shares or other financial
instruments and debt securities.

The petition may also provide for the possibility that secured claims are paid only in part. However, it is
necessary for the plan to provide for their satisfaction to a non-lesser extent than that the one which can be
realized, by reason of preferential placement, from the relevant proceeds in the event of a judicial liquidation,
having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption
exists.

The proposal of the bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella liquidazione
_giudiziale) must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority of claims_
(and, if classes are formed, by a majority of the claims in each class and the majority of the classes). Secured
creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal, unless (i) they waive their security; or (ii) the bankruptcy
composition agreement with creditors provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market
value of their secured assets (please note that such value must be assessed by an independent expert), in which
case they can vote only in respect of the portion of their debt affected by the proposal. Final court
confirmation is also required. The bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella
_liquidazione giudiziale), once approved and homologated, is mandatory for: (i) all existing creditors prior to_
the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and (ii) creditors who have not applied for the admission to
the judicial liquidation estate, to whom the guarantees or the security interest given in the bankruptcy
composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale) by third parties do not extend.

Upon the termination of the judicial liquidation—following the homologation decree (decreto di omologa),
which pursuant to article 247 of the Insolvency Code may be challenged and appealed within 30 (thirty) days
from its notification—the debtor returns “in bonis”.

**_Composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) under the Insolvency Code_**

Prior to the opening of judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), a debtor that is facing a situation of either
crisis or insolvency may apply for a pre-insolvency composition with creditors proceeding (“concordato
_preventivo”) pursuant to Insolvency Code, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its_
business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of insolvency proceedings.

Such concordato proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise (imprenditore commerciale) which exceeds
any of the following thresholds: (i) annual balance sheet assets (attivo patrimoniale) greater than €00,000 in
the last three financial years (from the date on which the petition for judicial liquidation was filed) or from the
establishment of the company if it has been incorporated less than three years before the concordato petition;
(ii) annual gross proceeds (ricavi lordi) greater than €200,000 over the last three financial years (from the date
on which the concordato petition was filed) or from the establishment of the company if it has been
incorporated less than three years before the concordato petition; and (iii) indebtedness (including debt that is
not overdue and payable) greater than €500,000.

Only the debtor itself can file the concordato petition before the court based in the location of the debtor’s
main office.

The concordato petition must be accompanied by a number of mandatory documents and annexes, among
which, inter alia, a workout plan, the content of which shall meet specific requirements set forth under the
Insolvency Code including, without limitation, description of the reasons why the company is facing a
distressed situation, description of the company’s group and activity, the liquidation value (valore di
_liquidazione) of the company’s assets in a judicial liquidation scenario, content of the restructuring proposal_
to creditors and a report drafted by a third-party independent expert in possession of certain professional
requirements certifying the truthfulness of the data on which the plan is grounded and its feasibility, copy of
the company’s financial statements in relation to the past three financial years, as well as updated economic
and financial accounts of the company, an exhaustive description of the company’s assets and the list of the
company’s creditors, indicating their names, the amount of their claims and the ranking of such claims.

Furthermore, pursuant to the Insolvency Code, the debtor shall file a report describing all acts and
transactions exceeding the ordinary course of business carried out by the company over the preceding


-----

five years; a description of possible legal actions for damages as well as possible claw-back actions and legal
actions potentially enforceable against the company and its corporate bodies in a judicial liquidation scenario;
as well as in case the company belongs to a group, certain additional information about the group itself.

According to articles 39 para. 3 and 44 of the Insolvency Code, the debtor may file a “preliminary and
simplified application” for admission to concordato preventivo (so called “concordato in bianco” or
“concordato con riserva”), meaning that the company might request to the courts the granting of a deadline—
for a minimum of 30 (thirty) days to a maximum of 60 (sixty) days—within which the company shall then file
the “full application” including the concordato plan and all other necessary documents. When filing a
“simplified application”, the company must only attach to the relevant petition: (i) copy of the company’s
financial statements relating to its three last financial years; and (ii) a list of the company’s creditors, indicating
the name of the relevant creditor, the amount and ranking of its claim towards the company as well as its
digital domicile (domicilio digitale). According to the Insolvency Code, within the aforementioned deadline
the company is also entitled to file (instead of the full concordato application) a petition for homologation of
debt-restructuring agreement under article 57 of the Insolvency Code or for homologation of a restructuring
plan subject to homologation under article 64-bis of the Insolvency Code. Such deadline can be extended
only once for additional maximum 60 (sixty) days upon the company’s request, provided that there are
reasonable grounds (giustificati motivi) for such extension and that no petitions for the opening of judicial
liquidation are pending against the company. In case the debtor does not file the proposal, the plan, the expert
report and the other documents within the established deadline, the court will not admit the debtor’s request
and, if the criteria provided by the Insolvency Code are met, the court could open the judicial liquidation
upon request from a creditor or the public prosecutor. Upon grating of the deadline by the courts and up until
its expiry, the debtor shall comply with the monthly information undertakings set by the court itself, including,
_inter alia, information undertakings relating to the debtor’s financial management and to the activities carried_
out in order to finalize the debtor’s workout plan and proposal to creditors.

Moreover, the debtor shall monthly file with the court an updated report about the company’s financial
situation, which is then published in the competent companies’ register. Pending the above-mentioned
deadline, the debtor can carry out both activities of ordinary management and urgent activities of
extraordinary management provided that, in the latter case, it has been duly and priorly authorized by the
Court. After the company’s filing of the preliminary and simplified application, appoints a Pre Judicial
Commissioner (pre-commissario giudiziale), who will supervise the proceeding and will have to review—inter
_alia and together with the Court—all the company’s requests for authorization relating to the performance of_
activities of extraordinary management. All the third-party claims which may arise from acts legally
performed by the debtor after the filing will be deemed super-senior (prededucibili).

The concordato petition is published by the debtor in the company’s register by the registry of the court and
communicated to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court
homologates the concordato preventivo, pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (except in case
this has been priorly authorized by the courts) and mortgages registered within the 90 (ninety) days preceding
the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are
ineffective against such pre-existing creditors.

According to article 54, paragraph 2, of the Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for the admission to
the concordato proceedings includes the relevant request for protective measures, from the date of publication
of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the
conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant measures). Final
decision on such request (which is provisionally effective starting from its publication in the companies’
register) shall be taken by the competent court and the length of the stay of action period is for maximum
four months (subject to extensions under certain circumstances, in any case not exceeding an overall period of
twelve months). During the stay of action period, inter alia, the judicial liquidation cannot be opened by the
court.

Protective measures might be revoked by the Courts upon occurrence of certain circumstances, including—
without limitation—upon discovery of fraudulent acts by the debtor. The debtor may request, by a subsequent
petition, to be granted by additional interim measures to prevent certain actions of one or more creditors
from affecting, from the negotiation phase, the positive outcome of the initiatives taken for the regulation of
the crisis or insolvency. The abovementioned measures can also be requested by the debtor pursuant to article
44 of the Insolvency Code, together with a “preliminary and simplified application” for the access to one of
the restructuring tools provided for by the Insolvency Code.


-----

Unless specific provisions apply by operation of law or relevant collective contracts (contratti collettivi), a
company employing more than 15 (fifteen) employees must inform in writing the relevant trade union
representatives about the decisions taken while drafting the concordato plan and which have an impact over
the employment agreements of a number of employees, including in case such decisions relate to the workorganization and/or the modalities of work. Trade union representatives can ask for a meeting with the
company by the 3 (three) days following receipt of such notice and the following consultation among the
parties shall start by the following 5 (five) days and—unless otherwise agreed—shall have a duration of no
more than 10 (ten) days.

In addition to all the above, upon filing of concordato application (including filing of a simplified petition),
_inter alia (i) as a general rule, monetary obligations of the company are deemed as due on the date of_
concordato filing; (ii) set-off is allowed only if (a) all the claims/debts subject matter of the set-off arose prior
to the filing date; or (b) all the claims/debts subject matter of the set-off arose after the filing date; (iii) accrual
of interest on unsecured claims is suspended. Interests on secured claims will continue to accrue in accordance
with specific rules set out under the Insolvency Code.

Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the concordato preventivo application and
in accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also exempt from
certain bankruptcy crimes provided under articles 322, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”), and 323
(“simple bankruptcy”) of the Insolvency Code, in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the
composition with creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under article 99 of the Insolvency Code
upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have
super senior priority (prededucibili) in the event of a subsequent judicial liquidation.

The concordato plan can be aimed either at:

i. the direct or indirect continuation of the company’s business activity (so called “concordato in
_continuità aziendale”)—in such event, creditors are satisfied (in full or part) with the proceeds arising_
from the continuation of the business activity; or

ii. at the liquidation of the company’s assets (so called “concordato con liquidazione del
_patrimonio”)—in such event, the concordato plan must necessarily provide for a cash injection, by a_
third-party, which can increase of at least 10% (ten per cent.) the available assets and ensure a
minimum recovery of at least 20% (twenty per cent.) for unsecured creditors.

The proposal filed in connection with the concordato petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and
payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of
at least 20% (twenty per cent.) of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors
with continuity of the going concern (concordato in continuità aziendale)), including through extraordinary
transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares,
bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the
transfer to an assumptor (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition
proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes (which is mandatory in certain cases provided under the
article 85 of the Insolvency Code), provided that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous
legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes.
The concordato proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of
certain taxes.

Please note that concordato preventivo qualifies as “with going concern” (in continuità aziendale) when the
plan provides for the continuation, on a direct or indirect basis, of the business by the debtor activity and
creditors are satisfied—even through a non-prevalent extent—through the proceeds arising from the
continuation of the business activity. Pursuant to article 84 of the Insolvency Code, the business continuity
shall safeguard the creditors’ interest as well as, to the maximum extent possible, the occupational levels of the
company.

Furthermore, certain specific rules apply only to composition with creditors proceedings with going concern
(in continuità aziendale). In particular, inter alia:

i. under article 84, para. 6 of the Insolvency Code, in a composition with creditors proceedings with
going concern (in continuità aziendale) (a) proceeds arising from the liquidation of company’s assets
shall be distributed to creditors in accordance with the so called “absolute priority rule”, i.e., in
accordance with the creditors’ ranking pursuant to Italian law; whilst (b) proceeds arising from the
continuation of the business activity (thus, exceeding the liquidation value) can be distributed in


-----

accordance with the so called “relative priority rule”, meaning that it is not mandatory to distribute
them in accordance with creditors’ ranking but it is sufficient to ensure that all classes of creditors
sharing the same ranking are treated equally and in a way which is more favorable than that of the
classes of creditors ranking junior to them. Without prejudice to the above, claims which are secured
pursuant to article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e., salaries) must be satisfied in compliance
with the “absolute priority rule”;

ii. the division into classes is mandatory. Classes must be created also in relation to secured creditors
unless they are repaid in full by means of cash within 180 (one hundred and eighty) days (reduced to
30 (thirty) days for employees) after the homologation without any waiver to their security interests.
So called “imprese minori” (i.e. enterprises not subject to judicial liquidation) which are unsecured
creditors of the company under supply agreements for goods or services shall be put into different
classes;

iii. save for the provisions provided for under article 109 of the Insolvency Code, under article 86 of the
Insolvency Code the concordato plan of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (in
_continuità aziendale), may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which may extend up to_
six months from the date of homologation of the concordato proposal for the payment of secured
creditors (creditori privilegiati) pursuant to article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e. employees,
professionals etc.);

iv. the concordato plan of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (in continuità
_aziendale) must detail, inter alia, the financial impact of the plan and the time needed to achieve the_
rebalance of the company’s financial situation. Moreover, in case the plan provides for the direct
continuation of the business activity, the plan must include a detailed indication of the envisaged
costs and sales, financial needs and relevant cashflows, also considering those costs which are
necessary to ensure compliance with applicable employment and environmental laws;

v. the expert’s report must certify that such plan is aimed at overcoming or preventing the company’s
insolvency and at ensuring the economic sustainability of the company. Moreover, the expert’s report
shall confirm that creditors’ treatment (recovery) in the concordato is not worse than creditors’
treatment (recovery) in a judicial liquidation;

vi. creditors cannot unilaterally refuse to fulfil their obligations under pending contracts, nor they can
terminate them or anticipate relevant due dates/expiry dates or amend them in way which is
detrimental for the debtor for the sole reason of the debtor’s application for/access to composition
with creditors on a going concern basis (in continuità aziendale) (or of the granting of protective
measures). Any contrary provision is ineffective. Without prejudice to the above, creditors which are
interested by protective measures cannot unilaterally refuse to fulfil their obligations under “essential
pending contracts” (contratti essenziali in corso di esecuzione) nor they can terminate them or
anticipate relevant due dates/expiry dates or amend them in way which is detrimental for the debtor
for the sole reason of nonpayment, by the debtor, of claims arisen before filing of the application for
to composition with creditors on a going concern basis (in continuità aziendale). According to the
Insolvency Code, a contract is “essential” if it is necessary for the continuation of the ordinary
business activity, including supply contracts the cessation of which could prevent the company to
continue its business activity.

Under article 100 of the Insolvency Code, inter alia, a debtor who files for a concordato on a going concern
basis (in continuità aziendale) may request the court to authorize payment: (i) of debts arisen before
concordato filing in relation to supply of goods or services which are essential for the company, provided that
an independent expert certifies that they are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction
of creditors; and (ii) in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, of the instalments due under a loan
agreement which is secured by a security interests over the assets used in the business, provided that (a) on the
concordato filing date, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations under the agreement, or the court authorizes the
payment of the debt for principal and interest due at that date; and (b) a third-party independent expert
certifies that such payments are essential for the continuation of the business activity and functional to
ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors and that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the
proceeds of the liquidation of the asset, carried out at market value, and that the repayment of the instalments
does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors.

As mentioned, according to article 84 of the Insolvency Code, in a composition with creditors proceeding
without going concern (“con liquidazione del patrimonio”), concordato proposal must provide for a


-----

contribution (cash injection) of resources by a third-party, which can increase of at least 10% (ten per cent.)
the assets (attivo) available to creditors as of the filing date and ensure a minimum recovery of at least 20%
(twenty per cent.) for unsecured creditors. The third-party resources subject matter of the mandatory
contribution can be distributed to creditors also irrespectively of their ranking, provided that the abovementioned 20% (twenty per cent.) minimum recovery is achieved.

According to the Insolvency Code, contributions made by the company’s shareholders without any repayment
obligation by the company (as well as shareholders’ contributions fully and expressly subordinated) qualify as
“third-party contributions” for the purposes of article 84 of the Insolvency Code, if the plan provides for
their direct application to the benefit of company’s creditors. As a general rule, the division into classes of
creditors is not mandatory for composition with creditors proceeding without going concern (“con
_liquidazione del patrimonio”). However, pursuant to article 85 para. 2 of the Insolvency Code, classes must be_
created in relation to the following creditors: (i) creditors for tax claims and/or social contributions claims
which will not be repaid in full; (ii) creditors benefitting of security interests/guarantees issued by third parties;
(iii) creditors which will be satisfied not by means of cash (also in case satisfaction is made partly in cash and
partly by way of other means); (iv) creditors who filed a “competing concordato proposal” and their related
parties.

Upon the filing, the Courts, inter alia, determines whether the proposal for the composition is admissible
assessing: (i) in case of a composition with creditors proceeding without going concern (“con liquidazione del
_patrimonio”), the admissibility of the proposal and the feasibility of the plan (meaning that the plan shall not_
be manifestly unfit to achieve the envisaged goals; and (ii) in case of a composition with creditors on a going
concern basis (in continuità aziendale), compliance of the proposal with applicable provisions of law (ritualità).
The proposal for concordato with going concern is, in any case, not admissible if the plan is manifestly unfit
to satisfy the creditors as proposed by the debtor and to preserve the company’s going concern value (valori
_aziendali)._

If the court determines that the concordato proposal is admissible, inter alia, it appoints a delegated judge
(giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints (or confirms, as the case may be) one or more judicial
commissioners (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific period of time during which creditors can
express their vote.

During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate
bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial commissioners and judge
(who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). Furthermore, up until the
homologation of the proceeding, the debtor cannot make any payments of debts arisen before the opening of
the proceeding itself, unless they have been specifically approved by the delegated judge.

Pursuant to the Insolvency Code: (i) one or more creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled,
controlling or under common control of the debtor), representing at least 10% (ten per cent.) of the aggregate
claims resulting from the updated accounts of the debtor filed with the courts; and (ii) shareholders
representing at least 10% (ten per cent.) of the company’s share capital, may file a concordato preventivo
proposal competing with the debtors’ proposal (proposta concorrente)—within 30 (thirty) days before the
starting of the voting process—subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the
proposal of the debtor does not envisages the payment of at least 30% (thirty per cent.) of the unsecured
claims (such threshold is reduced to 20% (twenty per cent.) in case the debtor had priorly and successfully
started a negotiated crisis composition proceeding (composizione negoziata)).

Furthermore, pursuant to article 91 of the Insolvency Code, if the concordato plan, includes an offer for the
sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court or
the delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the offer itself in order to acquire
competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated judge,
by decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding. Furthermore, the abovementioned decree
establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers, providing that in all cases, among others,
the following is ensured: (i) their comparability; (ii) the requirements for the participation of the bidders;
(c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information; (iii) any limits on their use; (iv) the modalities
according to which the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them; (v) the modalities
according to which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (vi) the minimum increase in the
consideration to be provided by the subsequent offers; (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders; (vii) the
forms of publicity, and (viii) the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids, if the sale takes place before
the judge. With the sale or with the assignment, if earlier, to a person other than the original bidder identified


-----

in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their obligations towards each other and accordingly
the debtor shall amend the proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome of the competitive proceeding.

As a general rule, the concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court and
must be approved with the favorable vote of (i) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables
admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (ii) the majority
of the receivables admitted to vote is reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to article 109, paragraph 1,
of the Insolvency Code, in case one creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting,
it is also necessary to reach majority by headcount (maggioranza per teste). The concordato preventivo is
approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who
did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato proposal. Secured creditors
are not entitled to vote on the concordato proposal unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the
concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their
secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in
respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among others, (i) the companies controlling the
debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity controlling the debtor, (ii) the
assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been perfected during the year
preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting.

Differently from the general rules set out above, a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (in
_continuità aziendale) is approved with the positive vote of all the creditors’classes. In each class, the concordato_
is approved with the positive vote of creditors representing the majority of claims admitted voting or, if such
threshold is not met, with the positive vote of creditors representing two-thirds of the claims of voting
creditors, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. Secured
creditors are not admitted voting if they are repaid in full (and in cash) within 180 days (one hundred and
eighty) (reduced to 30 (thirty) days for employees) after the homologation without any waiver to their security
interests. If such requirements are not met, then secured creditors are entitled to vote. Without prejudice to
the above, the Insolvency Code provides that composition with creditors on a going concern basis (in
_continuità aziendale) can be homologated by the Courts also in case it is not approved by all the classes upon_
certain specific conditions being met.

If concordato competing proposal (proposte concorrenti) have been filed by one or more creditors, they will be
subject to the vote by creditors as well. The winning proposal is that which results in the highest majority of
positive votes and, in the event of a tie, the debtor’s proposal prevails against a creditor’s, while a creditor’s
proposal will prevail over the one of another creditor if it has been filed before. In the event that none of the
proposals achieves the required number of votes as described above, the judge shall re-submit to vote the
proposal which obtained the highest majority.

Please note that the delegated judge may provisionally admit (in whole or in part) to the voting session
creditors of disputed claims for the sole purpose of the vote on the concordato proposal and of the calculation
of the relevant majorities. Excluded creditors shall have the right to oppose such decision by submission of a
specific filing in the context of the homologation by the court, in any case, only if their participation in the
voting session may have affected the calculation of the relevant majorities.

Once the concordato preventivo has been approved by creditors, the Court sets the date for the hearing aimed
at the Court’s formal homologation (omologazione) of the concordato preventivo and then the debtor notifies
the relevant parties. At least 10 (ten) days before the date of the homologation hearing, any dissenting creditor
and/or any third-party interested in doing so can file a challenge/appeal (“opposizione”) against the proposed
homologation of the composition with creditors proceeding. In case no challenges (opposizioni) are filed, the
court shall homologate the concordato after verifying (i) the regularity of the concordato proceeding; (ii) the
outcome of the creditors’ vote; (iii) the admissibility of the proposal; (iv) the proper creation of the classes of
creditors; and (v) the equal treatment of creditors within each class. In addition, in case of a concordato with
going concern, the court shall verify that all classes have voted in favor of the proposal, the plan has reasonable
prospects of preventing or overcoming insolvency, and any new financing is necessary to implement the plan
and does not unfairly prejudice the interests of creditors. In any other case, the court shall verify the feasibility
of the plan (i.e. the plan not being manifestly unfit to achieve the stated objectives).

Furthermore, in case of a concordato with going concern, if one or more classes are dissenting, the court,
upon request of the debtor (or, in case of a competing concordato proposal, with the consent of the debtor)
may homologate the concordato anyway, if the following conditions are jointly met: (i) the liquidation value
is distributed in accordance with the ranking of each claim (absolute priority rule); (ii) the resources arising
from the going concern exceeding the liquidation value are distributed in such a way that the claims included


-----

in the dissenting classes receive overall treatment at least equal to that of the classes of the same ranking and
more favorable than that of the classes of lower ranking (relative priority rule); (iii) no creditor receives more
than the amount of their claim; and (iv) the proposal is approved by the majority of the classes, provided that
at least one of them consists of secured creditors or, failing that, the proposal is approved by at least one class
of creditors which would be at least partially satisfied based on the respective ranking of the claims even on
the value exceeding the liquidation value.

Moreover, pursuant to article 88 of the Insolvency Code, if the debtor made a proposal for “transazione
_fiscale” to Tax Authorities/Social Security Authorities under the Insolvency Code, the courts can homologate_
the concordato also without the consent of such creditors when their consent is required for achieving the
applicable majorities, provided that the expert’s report certifies that the proposal made by the debtor to such
creditor is more convenient than a liquidation scenario.

In case of challenges against the homologation, the Court shall decide and rule upon each of the challenges.
In case the Court rejects all challenges and has no additional remarks, then it will issue the homologation
decree.

Article 112 of the Insolvency Code provides for a “cram-down” mechanism whereby:

i. in case of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (in continuità aziendale), if a creditor
challenges the “convenience” of the concordato proposal, the court can homologate the concordato
only if it deems that the relevant claim will be satisfied for an amount not lower than the amount
that would be paid in the frame of a judicial liquidation;

ii. in all other cases, the court can homologate a concordato preventivo petition challenged by (i) a
creditor which is a member of a “dissenting class” of creditors; or (ii) in case there are no classes of
creditors, by creditors representing 20% (twenty per cent.)of the claims admitted to vote, to the
extent that (a) such challenge(s) are about the “convenience”of the concordato proposal; and (b) the
court deems that the relevant claim will be satisfied for an amount not lower than the amount that
would be paid in the frame of a judicial liquidation.

In addition, if the plan provides that pre-existing shareholders would benefit from the so-called “restructuring
value”, then concordato can be homologated if one or more classes of creditors are dissenting, to the extent
that the recovery of each dissenting class is at least equal to the recovery of other classes having the same
ranking and more favorable than the recovery proposed to classes ranking junior, even if the restructuring
value reserved to the shareholders were to be applied to such classes. According to the Insolvency Code, the
“restructuring value reserved to shareholders” means the effective value of the shareholders’ stakes into the
company following the homologation of the proposal, net of any contributions/injections made by the
shareholders for the purposes of the restructuring. Shareholders can challenge the homologation if the latter
is prejudicial to them compared to a liquidation scenario.

If the composition with creditors provides for the liquidation of the debtor’s assets, the court, if homologates
the concordato, appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized
by way of a transfer of assets. The court may grant special powers to the commissioner to implement the plan
if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required.

If the court does not homologate the concordato, it might open judicial liquidation of the company only if
there are pending petitions in such respect.

The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time,
by the debtor are not automatically affected by the concordato preventivo proceeding and normally continue
pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to article 97 of the
Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the Courts to either terminate or suspend the effectiveness of such
pending agreements (save for certain exceptions: for instance, employment contracts cannot be suspended nor
terminated) in case the continuation of the agreement is not in line with the plan nor functional to its
implementation. Please note that termination can be requested only if concordato plan and proposal have
already been filed before the Courts. In such circumstances, the counterparty shall be entitled to an indemnity
equal to the damages suffered because of the termination or suspension of the contract. Such indemnity shall
be considered as an unsecured claim arisen before the concordato proceeding, without prejudice, however, to
the super-senior ranking of those claims arisen because of transactions legally carried out after the publication
of the concordato petition in the Companies’ Register (and before the notification of the suspension/
termination petition).


-----

Specific rules are provided in relation to the termination of financial lease agreements and pending facilities
agreements. In such latter respect, para. 14 of article 97 of the Insolvency Code states that, upon termination
of a facility agreement, the lender is entitled to cash-in and retain the amounts paid by company’s debtors up
until repayment in full of the advances disbursed by the lender to the company in the period between (i) the
date falling 120 (one hundred and twenty) days before concordato filing; and (ii) the date on which the petition
for termination of the agreement has been notified to the lender.

In addition to all the above, article 95 of the Insolvency Code clarifies that pending contracts with Italian
Public Authorities are not terminated as a result of concordato filing and any contrary provisions are
ineffective; such contracts continue to be effective if the third-party independent expert certifies that such
contracts are consistent with the plan (if already drafted) and that the company is reasonably able to fulfil
them. If the composition with creditors on a going concern basis (in continuità aziendale), the expert shall also
attest that the continuation of such contracts is necessary to achieve the best liquidation of the company’s
business unit (migliore liquidazione dell’azienda in esercizio). After concordato filing, the company can
participate in public tender processes with the prior authorization of the Courts and upon meeting certain
requirements set out under the Insolvency Code (including filing of a third-party expert report in such
respect).

Pursuant to article 89 of the Insolvency Code, the rules governing the loss and reduction of the share capital
set forth in the Italian Civil Code do not apply to Italian companies during the period from the date of filing
of concordato application until the date of its homologation. During such period, moreover, the rule
according to which a company shall be wound up in case of reduction or loss of the share capital, does not
apply.

Nevertheless, during the period preceding the filing of the concordato application, article 2486 of the Italian
Civil Code—providing for the powers and duties of the directors after the occurrence of an event of
dissolution of the company—will be applicable.

For the analysis of the rules regulating the new financial resources please see the specific section under
paragraph “New financial resources” below.

Pursuant to articles 119 and 120 of the Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition with
creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the concordato can be terminated or
annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors; the judicial liquidation may
follow.

Concordato preventivo is mandatory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the
companies’register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors
of the debtor.

In case of non-minor breaches, the concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial
commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought
within one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the
concordato itself. The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of one
or more creditors in case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been
willfully exaggerated. The relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the
concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the
last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself.

Finally, please note that articles 284 and followings of the Insolvency Code provide for composition with
creditors group-proceedings. More precisely, if more companies (having their center of main interests in Italy)
belonging to the same group are facing a situation of crisis or insolvency they can make a single application
for composition with creditors proceeding, including a single concordato plan or multiple connected plans.
Assets and liabilities of each group company shall be assessed on a single-entity basis. In such case, the legal
framework of composition with creditors group-proceedings is the same applicable to the ordinary type, save
for certain specific rules/exceptions, among which, inter alia: (i) the concordato petition shall specify the
reasons why a group proceeding is more convenient for creditors than single and separate proceedings; (ii) the
concordato petition and the plan/plans must include certain additional information, mainly relating to group
structure, intercompany relationships, etc.; (iii) the plan(s) must ensure the restructuring of each group
company and must be certified by the third-party expert. The expert’s report shall also confirm that the
group-proceeding is more convenient for creditors than separate proceedings; (iv) the plan(s) might provide
both for the continuation of certain business activities and the liquidation of others. The proceeding qualifies
as composition with creditors on a going concern basis (in continuità aziendale) whenever the proceeds arising


-----

from the continuation of business exceed the proceeds arising from the liquidation of assets; and (v) certain
specific rules in relation to the voting phase and homologation phase of the proceeding apply.

**_Negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) under the Insolvency_**
**_Code_**

The negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) was originally
introduced in the Italian legal framework by Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into
the Insolvency Code. It consists of a negotiated and out-of-court tool applicable to both commercial
enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) and agricultural enterprises (imprenditori agricoli), which are
undergoing a distressed situation with reference to their assets, their business and/or their financial situation,
such that it is likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will follow. Therefore, it is a tool aiming at anticipating
further deterioration of the debtor’s situation.

Without prejudice to the above, the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the
entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to article 18 of the Insolvency Code requesting the competent court to
confirm or modify the protective measures provided for pursuant to the same provision on the same day as
the publication of the request in the relevant companies’ register and the acceptance of the expert, and, if
necessary, to enact the interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations, and (ii) when the entrepreneur
files a petition asking the court to authorize certain acts in line with the provisions set forth under article 22 of
the Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to article 17 of the Insolvency Code, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a negotiated crisis
composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa), inter alia, shall certify that no judicial
liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings are pending towards itself nor requests for the admission to
the procedures provided for under articles 40 of the Insolvency Code, including pursuant to articles 44, para. 1,
letter (a) and 54, para. 3, have been previously filed. In the event that the petition for a negotiated crisis
composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) is dismissed (arhiviata) shall not submit
a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal (the term is reduced, for one time only, to four months
if such dismissal is requested by the entrepreneur within two months starting from the acceptance of the
expert).

The negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) is commenced on
a voluntary basis only, filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and independent expert to the
Secretary General of the relevant Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform and the
expert is appointed within 5 (five) days upon the filing of the request. Pursuant to the Insolvency Code, the
person to be appointed as expert shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur
during the two years following the termination of the negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione
_negoziata per la crisi di impresa). The petition cannot be filed pending a procedure for over-indebtedness_
restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets pursuant to articles 7 and 14-ter of Law no. 3/2012
(procedimenti di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio). The expert is
responsible for facilitating and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other
interested parties, in order to identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through
the transfer of the business or a branch thereof.

The expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and his/ her
own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is
positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on the dedicated electronic platform. If
the expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are
concrete and real chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally, and can be assisted by
its advisors.

If the expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery, he/she meets with the parties involved
in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close
in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with
fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions
carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations.
The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage his/her
assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and,
in case of credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations
actively and in an informed manner. The access to the composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la
_crisi di impresa) does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions_
apply to negotiations involving employment contracts.


-----

If the expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery, after the meeting with the entrepreneur or
thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the Secretary General of the Chamber of
Commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The negotiated crisis composition
procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) shall not exceed 180 (one hundred and eighty) days,
subject to a possible extension of additional 180 (one hundred and eighty) days upon certain requirements.
More specifically, the expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 (one hundred and eighty)
days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the expert)
for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the expert’s appointment can continue up to
further 180 (one hundred and eighty) days if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the
expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed
a petition to the court pursuant to article 19 and/ or article 22 of the Insolvency Code.

At the end of his/her appointment the expert issues a final report, to be uploaded it on the platform, and
notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the protective measures and interim measures
(if any) which declares the termination of their related effects.

Pursuant to article 18 of the Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the expert, or
with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of protective measures, which may
also be limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors. If
the protective measures are granted, from the date of publication of the relevant petition, pre-existing creditors
cannot obtain pre-emption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all
enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, please note that, differently from what it is provided
under the Insolvency Code for the composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), payment of
pre-existing creditors is not forbidden. The protective measures do not apply to employees’ claims.

Starting from the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the protective measures
until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the negotiated crisis
composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa), the judgement of opening the judicial
liquidation (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the declaration of the insolvency of the
entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court, provided that the court revokes the protective
measures.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the protective measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their
obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate
their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the
ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the
application of the protective measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the pending
contracts from the publication of the petition requesting protective measures to the obtainment of such
protective measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the protective measures, it must simultaneously file the same request to the
competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to
modify them. In the absence of this request, the protective measures will be ineffective.

The duration of the protective measures and, if necessary, the interim measures, is established by an order of
the court in a range between 30 (thirty) and 120 (one hundred and twenty) days, and, upon request of the
parties and after obtaining the opinion of the expert, can be extended for the time required to positively
finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 (two hundred and forty) days, given that the judge may
discretionary order the revocation of such protective measures or shorten their duration.

Pending the negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa), there is
no dispossession: the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of
the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to article 21 of the Insolvency Code,
pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity. Upon written
notice to the expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with
the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and
financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore acts, payments, and guarantees/security interests carried
out by the entrepreneur after the appointment of the expert under the negotiated crisis composition procedure
(composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) are not subject to claw-back action under article 166, para. 2 of
the Insolvency Code, if they are consistent with the status of the negotiations and the recovery perspectives of
the company. If during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there
are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors,


-----

subject to his liabilities. If the expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the
negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the
enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act,
the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the
companies’ register. At the request of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the expert, the court that has
granted the protective measures and/or interim measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce
their duration when they do not meet the aim of ensuring the positive outcome of the negotiations or they
appear disproportionate in relation to the prejudice caused to the creditors. If the protective measures are
revoked, the rule relating to the prohibition of the obtainment of pre-emption rights by pre-existing creditors
ceases to be effective for the date on which the protective measure has been revoked.

Upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business
as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, the court may authorize: (i) the
entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness
(prededucibile) pursuant to article 6 of the Insolvency Code; (ii) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior
indebtedness (prededucibile) by virtue of shareholders’financing pursuant to article 6 of the Insolvency Code;
and (iii) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided
under article 2560, para. 2 of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to article 2112 of the Civil Code,
identifying the appropriate measures to protect all the interests involved, taking also into account the requests
of the parties concerned. The court shall also verify the compliance with the competitiveness principle
(principio di competitività) in the selection of the purchaser.

Pursuant to article 23 of the Insolvency Code, if a suitable solution to overcome the entrepreneur’s difficulties
has been found, the negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa)
can terminate by means of:

i. the execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which
constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under article 25-bis, para. 1 of the
Insolvency Code if, according to the expert’s final report, such agreement ensures the continuation
of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years;

ii. the execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to article 62 of the
Insolvency Code;

iii. the execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the expert, with
the effects provided under articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. (d) and 324 of the Insolvency Code. With
such agreement the expert acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems
to be consistent with the composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur.

If, at the end of the negotiations, none of the above mentioned solutions have been elected, the entrepreneur
may, alternatively:

i. draft a certified restructuring plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to article 56 of the
Insolvency Code;

ii. file a petition requesting the homologation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Insolvency Code._
The percentage referred to under article 61, para. 2, letter (c) of the Insolvency Code is reduced to
60% (sixty per cent.) if the achievement of the agreement results from the final report of the expert;

iii. file a petition for the simplified composition with creditors proceeding for the liquidation of assets
(concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) (please see the paragraph “—Simplified
_composition with creditors proceeding for the liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato per la_
_liquidazione del patrimonio) under the Insolvency Code” below;_

iv. access to one of the proceedings/tools provided under the Insolvency Code or in the Decree 270 or
in the Decree 347.

Furthermore, pursuant to article 24 of the Insolvency Code:

i. the acts authorized by the court pursuant to article 22 of the Insolvency Code shall maintain their
effects in the event of the subsequent occurrence of an homologated debt-restructuring agreement
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omlogato), an homologated composition with creditors
proceeding (concordato preventivo omologato), an homologated restructuring plan pursuant to


-----

article 64-bis of Insolvency Code (piano di ristrutturazione omologato), the opening of the judicial
liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), the compulsory administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta
_amministrativa), the extraordinary administration (amministrazione straordinaria) or the simplified_
composition with creditors proceeding for the liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio);_

ii. the transactions, the payments and the granting of security interests carried out by the entrepreneur
after the acceptance by the expert of his/her appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions
pursuant to article 166, para. 2 of the Insolvency Code, if they are consistent with the development
and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery in place at the time the
transaction/payments/granting of security interest was made; and

iii. the extraordinary transactions and payment made after the acceptance by the expert of his/her
appointment are in any case subject to claw-back actions pursuant to article 165 and article 166 of
the Insolvency Code if the expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register pursuant
to article 21, para. 4 of the Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied its authorization
pursuant to article 22 of the Insolvency Code.

In addition, payment and transactions carried out after the acceptance by the expert of his/her accepted its
appointment, which the expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with
the perspectives of recovery of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to article 22
of the Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions.

Pursuant to article 25 of the Insolvency Code, the negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione
_negoziata per la crisi di impresa) may also apply to group of companies, which may commence one proceeding_
all together. At the end of the negotiations, the companies belonging to the same group may either entering
into one of the agreements provided under in article 23, para. 1 of the Insolvency Code as a group, or access
to one of the tools provided under article 23 of the Insolvency Code, both separately or as a whole group.

**_Simplified composition with creditors proceeding for the liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato per la_**
**_liquidazione del patrimonio) under the Insolvency Code_**

Simplified composition with creditors proceeding for liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio) is a particular type of composition with creditors proceeding (concordato_
_preventivo) available only for those companies which (i) had first made access to composition procedure_
(composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa); and (ii) as certified by the expert under the composition
procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa), notwithstanding the negotiations in good faith with
creditors could not achieve a positive outcome.

Simplified composition with creditors proceeding for liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio)—which has merely liquidation purposes—has originally been introduced in the_
Italian legal framework by Decree 118/2021 and has been subsequently incorporated into the Insolvency
Code.

If, in its final report, the expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been
conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under article 23, para. 1
and 2, letter (b) of the Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 (sixty) days following the notification of the
final report the entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where the company has its
registered office, a petition for admission to the simplified composition with creditors proceeding for
liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio), a concordato proposal
providing for the liquidation of the assets together with the liquidation plan and the documents provided
under article 39 of the Insolvency Code. The proposal may provide for the division of the creditors into
different classes.

The petition for the simplified composition with creditors proceeding for liquidation of assets (concordato
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) is communicated to the public prosecutor and published with_
the companies’ register within the day following the date of the filing with the court. From the date of such
publication, the effects provided under articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Insolvency Code apply.

Upon the filing of the application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, inter alia,
express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the opinion of
the auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing on the list


-----

filed by the debtor itself; and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the homologation. Creditors and any third
party which has any interests are entitled to object to the homologation within 10 (ten) days before the date
fixed for the hearing.

The court homologates the simplified composition with creditors proceeding for liquidation of assets
(concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) when it verifies (i) the regularity of the adversarial
principle among the parties (contraddittorio) and the proceeding; (ii) the compliance with the pre-emption
rights (cause di prelazione); (iii) the feasibility of the liquidation plan, and finds that the proposal does not
cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of judicial liquidation
(liquidazione giudiziale) of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain
recovery. With the homologation decree, the court also appoints a liquidator.

The parties may challenge the homologation decree within 30 (thirty) days after the notification of the same.

Pursuant to article 25-septies of the Insolvency Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer by a
preidentified third party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to
such third party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of
better solutions on the market, may implement the offer.

**_Certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) under article 56 of the Insolvency Code_**

Certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) under article 56 of the Insolvency Code are out
of-court tools consisting of a restructuring plan addressed to creditors and prepared by debtors who are
either insolvent or in a state of crisis, in order to permit the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and
supporting the rebalancing of the debtor’s financial condition, which shall be certified by a third-party
independent expert appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the register of auditors and accounting
experts (Registro dei Revisori Contabili). The independent expert—which must verify the feasibility of the
restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company—must possess certain
specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the
Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification.

The certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) are usually implemented by means of one or
more agreements entered by the company with the relevant creditors/counterparties. Such agreements are
merely private agreements and do not affect the right of creditors who are not a party to the agreement to
enforce their claims, guarantees or securities. As such, there is no “automatic stay” by operation of law. The
certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements
are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed
with the court or supervising authority. Also, no approval or consent by a specific majority of all outstanding
claims are required.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at restructuring the
debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Article 56 of the Insolvency Code sets out the
“minimum content” of the plan including, inter alia, indication of non-adhering creditors, the financial
resources necessary to pay their claims at the relevant due dates as well as the causes of the crisis. Also, it must
be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial situation of the debtor.

As expressly provided under article 166, para. 3, letter (d) of the Insolvency Code, should these plans fail, and
the debtor be declared insolvent, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the
debtor’s assets for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions, are not subject
to any claw-back action (azione revocatoria), including the ordinary claw-back action provided for pursuant
to article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (azione revocatoria). Furthermore, they are exempted from the
potential application of certain criminal sanctions.

There is no homologation by the court. The publication in the companies’ register of the plan, the report of
the independent expert and the agreement(s) is not mandatory and it is possible upon a debtor’s request and
would allow to certain tax benefits.

The Insolvency Law provides for specific rules regarding the protection against claw-back actions and
potential civil and criminal responsibilities in relation to the transactions, the payments and the securities
granted on debtor’s assets carried out in the context of implementation of certified restructuring plans (piani
_attestati di risanamento) under article 56 of the Insolvency Code._

**_Debt-restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) under article 57 of the Insolvency Code_**
**_and ff._**

A debtor which is insolvent or is facing a state of crisis may enter into a debt-restructuring agreement (accordo
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti) provided for pursuant to article 57 and ff. of the Insolvency Code with creditors_
holding at least 60% (sixty per cent.) of the outstanding indebtedness, which shall be certified by an
independent expert appointed by the debtor as per assessment of the truthfulness of the business and
accounting data provided by the company and the declaration of its feasibility and requesting its
homologation by the competent court.

More specifically, the independent expert, shall certify that the plan and the debt-restructuring agreement
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) ensure that the indebtedness vis-à-vis non-adhering creditors can be
fully satisfied within the following terms in a 120 (one hundred and twenty) day term from: (i) the date of
homologation of debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) by the court, in the case
of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the homologation; and
(ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the
non-adhering creditors as at the date of the homologation of the debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) by the court._

The debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) is published in the companies’register
and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Creditors and other interested parties may challenge
the debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) within 30 (thirty) days from the
publication of the same in the companies’ register. After having decided on the opposition filed (if any), the
court homologates the debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) by issuing a decree,
which can be appealed within 30 (thirty) days of its publication pursuant to article 51 of the Insolvency Code.

The Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt
restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti). The plan can therefore provide, inter alia,
either for the debtor or a third party carrying out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain
refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt-restructuring
agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or
deferred payment of certain taxes.

Pursuant to article 58, para. 1 of the Insolvency Code, in the event of substantial amendments to the plan
before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the debt-restructuring agreement
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) expressed by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed
in the event of substantial amendment. In the event of substantial amendments after the approval, the debtor
shall make such amendments as are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the agreements, by requesting
the update of the certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in article 57, para. 4 of
the Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the amended restructuring plan,
shall be published in the companies’ register, giving proper notice to the creditors by registered letter or via
certified email. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 (thirty)
days after having been notified of the same.

With the petition for the homologation of the debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei
_debiti) by the competent court (or at any time pending the procedure) the debtor may request to be granted_
any protective measures (aimed at providing for the stay of actions or the creation by creditors of security
interest, unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement in relation to pre-existing debts, etc.). Such
measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to article 54, para. 3 of the Insolvency Code, to the court by the
debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for the homologation of the
debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti)), subject to certain conditions, or
(ii) pursuant to article 44 of the Insolvency Code, together with a “simplified application” for the access to
one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Insolvency Code. According to article 54, para. 2 of the
Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for the homologation of the debt-restructuring agreement
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) includes the relevant request for measures, from the date of publication
of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the
conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant measures).

It is a court-supervised proceeding which does not provide for the dispossession of debtor; however, the court
may appoint a judicial commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case petitions for the
opening of judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of
the parties who filed such petitions. Creditors entering into the debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal_


-----

and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors,
which shall be fully re-paid within the relevant deadlines outlined above.

The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, fixes the date for a
hearing to be held no earlier of 15 (fifteen) days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such
deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the homologation. At such hearing,
the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met. Without
prejudice to all the above, articles 60, 61 and 62 of the Insolvency Code provide for the following additional
types of debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti).

First, article 60 of the Insolvency Code provides for the so-called facilitated debt-restructuring agreement
(“accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati”). Such proceeding is a particular kind of debt restructuring agreement
which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% (thirty per cent.) of the total indebtedness
(instead of the 60% (sixty per cent.) generally required under article 57, para. 1, of the Insolvency Code)
provided that the debtor: (i) does not propose the standstill on the payment of non-adhering creditors; and
(ii) has not previously requested (and waives to request) to the court the granting of protective interim
measures on its assets.

Pursuant to article 61 of the Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into debt-restructuring agreement
by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% (seventy five per cent.) of the credits belonging
to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests) and can request
the court to declare that agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category (so
called “cram down”).

More in detail, debt-restructuring agreement with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia
_estesa) under article 61 of the Insolvency Code can be applied to any category of creditors, provided that,_
_inter alia: (i) all the creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the_
negotiations and have been able to participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-todate information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation as well as on the restructuring
agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement provides for the continuation of the business activity either directly
or indirectly pursuant to article 84 of the Insolvency Code; (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors
belonging to a same category represent at least 75% (seventy five per cent.) of all the claims belonging to the
same category; (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category to which the effects of the
agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower than the amount they
would receive with the judicial liquidation being understood that a creditor may hold claims in more than one
category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court approval and the documents
attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed down. The percentage of 75% (seventy five per cent.) is
lowered to 60% (sixty per cent.) if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the final report issued by
the expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the negotiated crisis composition procedure
(composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa).

Moreover, pursuant to para. 5 of article 61 of the Insolvency Code, if a debtor whose financial indebtedness
is at least 50% (fifty per cent.) of their total indebtedness, debt-restructuring agreement may identify one or
more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal
position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who
are part of the same category. In such case, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or
indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, the rights of creditors who are not
banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

Pursuant to the article 62 of the Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered
into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% (seventy five per cent.) of the same class would is also
binding over the non-adhering creditors, provided that (i) certain conditions are met, such as, inter alia, (a) all
the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations,
have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information
on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects; (b) the
claims of the adhering creditors belonging to the same categories represent 75% (seventy five per cent.) of all
the creditors of the same class; and (c) there is a real prospect that the non-adhering creditors of the same
category, to whom the effects of the agreement are extended, may be satisfied at the outcome of the agreement
to an extent not less than in the judicial liquidation; and (ii) an independent expert certifies (i) the truthfulness
of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis
and (iii) the meeting of the condition under (i)(c) above (i.e. the fact that the treatment reserved to nonadhering creditors is at least equal to the one they could obtain in the context of a judicial liquidation).


-----

Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 (thirty) days after
the notification of the same.

In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under article 61 of the Insolvency Code and standstill
agreements provided under article 62 of the Insolvency Code may impose on the non-adhering creditors, inter
_alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the_
possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. By virtue of article 59 of the
Insolvency Code, article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the
debt-restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are
jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of
recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the
shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders
have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors.

For the analysis of the rules provided under article 99 of the Insolvency Code—which applies to both debt
restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and to the composition with creditors
proceedings (concordati preventivi)—regulating the super senior financings authorized before the
homologation of a debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and a composition
with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) please see the specific section under paragraph “—New
_financial resources” below._

**_Restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti a omologazione) under_**
**_article 64-bis of the Insolvency Code_**

The restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti a omologazione) under
articles 64-bis and 64-ter of the Insolvency Code constitute a novelty in the business and crisis and insolvency
legal framework. Pursuant to this new tool, which is available to debtors which are insolvent or are facing a
state of crisis, the distribution rules of regular insolvency proceedings can be disregarded, can be enacted
provided that certain strict requirements are met.

More precisely, by virtue of this instrument, pursuant to which the creditors must be divided into classes
according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests, the debtor may distribute to the creditors
the value generated by the plan even in derogation of the provisions governing the ranking/statutory order of
claims (principle of “par condicio creditorum”), provided that the proposal is approved by unanimous consent
of the classes.

The restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti a omologazione) shall
provide for payment in full, by means of cash, of claims secured by the privilege under article 2751-bis no. 1
of the Civil Code (i.e., salaries) within 30 (thirty) days of homologation and must be certified, as to the
truthfulness of the company data and the feasibility of the plan, by an independent professional meeting the
requirements of the Insolvency Code.

The debtor shall file the restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti a
_omologazione) before the courts together with all relevant documents provided under the Insolvency Code._
The court shall assess the regular filing and the correctness of the criteria for the formation of the classes: in
this case, the courts appoint the judicial commissioner, the delegated judge and set the deadlines for the
creditors to vote. The following phase must follow the steps of the common framework applicable to all
restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e. composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), debtrestructuring agreement (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale)).

From the date of filing of the petition until the homologation, the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and
extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of
the judicial commissioner.

There is no “automatic stay”: nevertheless, the debtor can file a specific request for the application of the stay
of action, to stop/block enforcement and/or pre-cautionary actions by creditors over its assets up until the
homologation of the agreement (and such request can be filed also pending the negotiations for the debt
restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti)). Final decision on such request (which is
provisionally effective) shall be taken by the competent courts and the length of such stay of action period is
for maximum 4 months (subject to extensions under certain circumstances, in any case not exceeding an
overall period of 12 months). During the stay-of-action period the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale)
cannot be opened by the courts.


-----

In each class, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if
two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least
half of the total claims of the same class have voted. Secured creditors are not admitted voting if they are
repaid in full (by means of cash) within 180 days (one hundred and eighty) (reduced to 30 (thirty) days for
employees) after the homologation without any waiver to their security interests. If the restructuring plan
(piano di ristrutturazione) is not approved by all classes, the debtor, inter alia, may amend the application by
making a proposal for a composition with creditors (concordato preventivo). The court will homologate the
restructuring plan (piano di ristrutturazione) in the event of approval by all classes. If a dissenting creditor
objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies
the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not
objected to the lack of convenience in its observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it
proves such the lack of objection was due to a cause not attributable to it. Against the judgment of the court
ruling on the homologation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione
_soggetto a omologazione), the parties may file an appeal before the competent court of appeal within the term_
of 30 (thirty) days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court. Acts, payments, and
guarantees/security interest on the debtor’s assets carried out in execution of the homologated restructuring
plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti a omologazione) and indicated therein are not
subject to claw-back action pursuant to article 166 of the Insolvency Code.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi_**
**_imprese in stato di insolvenza)_**

An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law (Italian Legislative Decree no. 270 of
1999) for large industrial and commercial enterprises (the Prodi bis procedure). The relevant company must be
insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must
have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two
thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two thirds of its income from sales and services
during its last financial year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a
petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy
proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary
administration proceedings.

There are two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase”.

_Judicial Phase_

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is
insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissiario
_giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or_
reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 (thirty) days, and within 10 (ten)
days from such filing, the Italian Productive Activities Minister (the “Ministry”) may make an opinion on the
admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30
(thirty) days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into
bankruptcy.

_Administrative Phase_

Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative
phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the Ministry. The
extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a
going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization
leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry)
(the “Recovery Plan”). The plan may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap,
an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been transferred, etc.)
(“concordato”). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 (thirty) days from submission by the
extraordinary commissioner.

In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition
and interim management of the company and sends it to the Italian Ministry of Economic Development.

The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing which
the company is declared bankrupt.


-----

**_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_**
**_insolvenza)_**

Introduced in 2003, pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Italian
Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently amended, this procedure, is also known as the Marzano procedure. It is
complementary to the Prodi bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The
Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi bis procedure. For example, although a company
must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry of Economic Development can be made before the court
commences the administrative phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at
least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt. The
decision of whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry of Economic Development
following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The
Ministry of Economic Development assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints
the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s
insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 (one hundred and eighty) days (or 270 (two hundred and
seventy) days if the Ministry of Economic Development so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery
Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within,
respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan is
approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative winding-up (“liquidazione coatta amministrativa”) is only available for public
interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other
financial institutions, none of which can be wound up pursuant to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant
whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up
is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court but by the relevant
administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered
not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the
relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of
the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (“commissario
_liquidatore”) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering_
committee (“comitato di sorveglianza”). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy
court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this
procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under
bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth
for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a
compulsory administrative winding-up.

The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims
largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings.

**_Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures_**

The Insolvency Code has introduced the definition of the organizational, administrative and accounting
structures (assetto organizzativo, amministrativo e contabile) of a company which are deemed to be adequate
(adeguato) under article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose
of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor. More
precisely, article 3 of the Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate organizational
structure in accordance with article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose of timely detection of the
crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and
recover business continuity.

According to article 3 of the Insolvency Code:

i. for the purpose of the timely detection of the company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures
deemed to be adequate should make it possible to:


-----

a. detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific
characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor;

b. verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity for
the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by article 3, para. 4 of the
Insolvency Code; and

c. derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test
for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery.

ii. the warning signs are identified, inter alia, as follows:

a. the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 (thirty) days equal to more than half of the
total monthly payroll amount;

b. the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 (ninety) days past due in an
amount greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due;

c. the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due
for more than 60 (sixty) days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form
for at least 60 (sixty) days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% (five per
cent.) of the total exposures; and

d. the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under
article 25-novies of the Insolvency Code.

**_New financial resources_**

Please find below a brief summary of the main features of the provisions concerning different available
financings under the Insolvency Code.

_Interim financings—article 99, paragraphs from 1 to 4 of the Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to article 99, para. 1 and 2, of the Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring transactions on
a going concern basis (continuazione dell’attività aziendale), also in cases in which business continuity is
maintained exclusively in a view of liquidation, upon the debtor’s request, the court, until the homologation
of the debt-restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) (pursuant to article 57, or article 60
or 61 of the Insolvency Code) or a petition pursuant to article 87 of the Insolvency Code in relation to the
composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), including in the case of a “simplified petition”
pursuant to article 44 of the Insolvency Code, may authorize the debtor to be granted with new super-senior
loans (finanziamenti prededucibili) and to secure such indebtedness, subject to the court’s authorization with
in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the petition specifies:

i. the purpose of the financing;

ii. that the debtor is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds; and

iii. that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going
concern or to the proceedings.

The petition shall be filed along with the report of the expert appointed by the debtor in which the latter,
having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the homologation, declares that the new loans
are instrumental to the continuity of the business activities until the homologation of the relevant insolvency
proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing
a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes
that there is the urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event
of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), the
aforementioned financings do not benefit from the super-senior priority (prededucibilità) in case the petition
or the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed acts in
fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the receiver proves that who made available such financings
to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_Bridge financings—article 99, para. 5 of the Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to article 99, para. 5, of the Insolvency Code, loans (together with the related claims) granted, in any
form, in view of the filing of a petition for the homologation of a debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di


-----

_ristrutturazione dei debiti) or a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) (finanza ponte),_
may be rank super-senior (prededucibili) provided that (i) they meet the requirements of article 99, para. 1 and
2 (as outlined above), and (ii) they are provided under the relevant plan and provided that super-seniority
(prededucibilità) is expressly provided for in the decree by means of which the court accepts the application for
admission to the composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) or homologate the
restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione).

The indebtedness under such loans may be secured, subject to the court’s authorization, with in rem security
(garanzie reali), or by assigning claims.

_Implementation financing—article 101 of the Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to article 101 of the Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring transactions on a going concern
basis (continuazione dell’attività aziendale), any loan granted to the debtor as implementation of an
homologated composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) or debt-restructuring agreement
(accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) ranks super-senior (prededucibile) to the extent that they are expressly
provided under the relevant plan providing for the continuation of the business activity.

In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), the
abovementioned loans do not benefit from the super senior priority (prededucibilità) in case the plan of the
composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) or of the debt-restructuring agreement (accord
_di ristritturazione), on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be_
based upon false data or omission of relevant information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the
creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the receiver proves that who made available such financings to the
debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_The shareholders’ financing—article 102 of the Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to article 102, para. 1 of the Insolvency Code, super-seniority (prededucibilità) is granted also for
claims up to 80% (eighty per cent.) of the value of shareholder loans that have been granted to the company
in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting counter-indemnities) in implementation or in
anticipation of a homologated composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) or debtrestructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione) (also by way of derogation from the statutory
subordination regime provided under the Italian Civil Code with respect to loans granted to limited liability
companies by its shareholders or by entities that exercise direction and coordination activities).

According to para. 2 of article 102 of the Insolvency Code, if the lender become a shareholder only following
the execution of the composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) or the debt-restructuring
agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), the superior seniority will apply to the entire amount of the
loan.

_Super senior ranking—article 99 para. 6 and article 101 para. 2 of the Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to article 6, para. 1 of the Insolvency Code, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the
claims deriving from the bridge financings, interim financings and implementation financings are supersenior (prededucibili) by operation of law.

According to article 6, para. 2 of the Insolvency Code, the super-seniority (prededucibilità) continues in the
context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings. In specific cases, the abovementioned loans
may not rank super-senior in case of judicial liquidation, if, inter alia, the receiver proves that acts of fraud
were committed by debtor.

More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information
are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of
the independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included in
plan underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement.

With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, article 99 para. 6 of the Insolvency Code provides
that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), such financings (although
authorized by the court in the context of the composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) or
the debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione)) do not benefit from super senior ranking when
it is proved (jointly) that: (i) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant


-----

information, or when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization;
and (ii) the receiver proves that the lender, at the date of granting of the loan, was aware of the
abovementioned circumstances.

With reference to implementation financings, article 101 para. 2 of the Insolvency Code provides that such
loans do not benefit from the super-seniority (prededucibilità), in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation
(liquidazione giudiziale) (alternatively): (i) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the
petition for the opening of the proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors proceeding
(concordato preventivo) or debt-restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) turns out to be
based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or (ii) when the debtor has carried out acts of
fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the lenders providing the loans were aware of such
circumstances at the time of the establishment of the financings.

**_Certain Italian Law Considerations in Relation to Guarantees and Security Interests and Certain Other_**
**_Additional Italian Legal Considerations_**

_Maximum Guaranteed Amount_

Under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued to guarantee conditional or
future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be
expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a
separate document, such as the Guarantee Agreement). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees
granted by Wepa Italia S.r.l. (the “Italian Guarantor”and, together with any future guarantor incorporated in
Italy, the “Italian Guarantors”) must be supported by corporate benefit. It has been held that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportional to the assets of each of the Italian Guarantors, there is the risk that the guarantee could be
declared void.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within
the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993 (the “Italian Banking
**Act”), whose exercise is exclusively reserved to banks and authorized financial intermediaries.**
Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, inter alia, entail the relevant guarantees
being considered null and void. In this respect, the Ministerial Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing
article 106, paragraph 3 of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or security interest
by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a
restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the
meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the
same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the Italian Guarantor and the guaranteed
entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a
restricted financial activity.

_Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance Issues under Italian Law_

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of
a guarantee) by a company incorporated in Italy must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by-laws
(statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and
certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context
of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be
triggered.

_Corporate Benefit_

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee) must
receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for it. The concept of a “corporate benefit” is not specifically
defined in the applicable legislation and is determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis. As a
general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis,
although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such
company belongs may also be taken into consideration.

An Italian company granting a guarantee or a security interest must receive a real and adequate benefit in
exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the transaction (including
granting a security interest or a guarantee) ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict of interest and the


-----

related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of
challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities also may be imposed on the directors of the company if it is assessed
that they did not act in the interest of it and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate
purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit
could also lead to civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over the Italian
grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the
transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared
null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such
third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream/cross stream/downstream security
interest or guarantees granted by Italian companies.

In relation to security interests or guarantees, while corporate benefit for a downstream security or guarantee
(i.e., a security or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the
relevant grantor) can usually be easily proved, the validity and effectiveness of an upstream or cross stream
security or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the
direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the
laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security
interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits
or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an
Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit
to it.

The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and is assessed and
determined on a case by case basis, further its existence is purely a factual analysis made by the company’s
directors. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a
stand-alone basis, although in certain circumstances, and subject to specific strict rules, the interest of the
group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. Generally, the risk assumed by
an Italian Guarantor or grantor of security must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic
benefit to it.

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements, the maximum amount that each of the Italian
Guarantors may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Conditions of Issue
and the Guarantee Agreement to be entered into by such Guarantor shall be subject to additional limitations.
In particular as regards to Italian Guarantors, such amount shall never exceed, at any time, an amount equal
to the sum of:

i. the aggregate principal amount of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility advanced from time
to time to the Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359
of the Italian Civil Code) as borrower under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,
notwithstanding any subsequent repayment, reduction or cancellation; and

ii. the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other financial support in any form
(such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions) advanced from time to
time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359
of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer, or any borrower under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, (whether directly or indirectly) as outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the
guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid by it pursuant to the enforcement of its
guarantee under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility in accordance with the previsions of the
Intercreditor Agreement; provided further that the Guarantor shall not be liable as “Guarantor” in
respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that it is entitled to set-off against its claims of
recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by it
under its guarantee.

It being understood that the obligations of an Italian Guarantor as Guarantor under the Conditions of Issue
and/or the Guarantee Agreement to be entered into by such Guarantor shall not extend to any obligation
incurred by the Issuer or any Guarantor, in full or in part, for the purpose of acquiring or subscribing the
shares or quota of such Italian Guarantor or any of its direct or indirect controlling company (or refinancing
any existing indebtedness incurred for such purposes), to the extent that such guarantee, obligation or liability
would constitute unlawful financial assistance under applicable Italian laws.


-----

In any event, for the purposes of Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, the maximum amount that each of the
Italian Guarantors may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Conditions of
Issue and the Guarantee Agreement to be entered into by such Guarantor shall not exceed in aggregate an
amount equal to 150% (one hundred and fifty per cent.) of the principal amount of the Notes and the Total
Commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (or its equivalent in any other currency).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided for in any guarantee limitation expressed by any debt
document to apply to the obligations under the relevant debt documents of any debtor incorporated under
the laws of Italy (each an “Italian Debtor”), any reference in that guarantee limitation to the aggregate
principal original amount of any intercompany loan or other financial support in any form of debt advanced
to such Italian Debtor (or any of its subsidiaries within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code
(each a “Relevant Subsidiary”)) by another debtor (other than by any of that Italian Debtor’s Relevant
Subsidiaries, and whether directly or indirectly) (the “Intercompany Liabilities”), shall for all purposes of the
debt documents be deemed to refer instead to an amount corresponding to a percentage of the Intercompany
Liabilities which is equal to the percentage borne by the aggregate amount of principal then outstanding from
the debtors under the relevant debt documents to the aggregate amount of principal then outstanding from
the debtors under all debt documents to which the relevant Italian Debtor is party as a Guarantor, so that,
where and to the extent such Intercompany Liabilities are taken as the basis for the computation of the
relevant guaranteed obligations, such Intercompany Liabilities will be counted once only, i.e. without any
double-counting.

To the extent the enforcement of any guarantee and security interests granted by any Italian Debtor is
expressed to be limited to an amount to be computed, inter alia, by reference to Intercompany Liabilities, then
for the purposes of determining the amount for which such guarantee and security interests may be enforced,
the amount of such Intercompany Liabilities shall be taken into account once only, i.e. without any doublecounting.

_Financial Assistance_

Save for specific exceptions, it is unlawful under Italian laws for a company to give financial assistance (whether
by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third
party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian
company, and any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void.
Financial assistance to refinance indebtedness incurred by a company to purchase or subscribe for its own
shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company might also be considered as falling within
the scope of Italian financial assistance provisions. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure
to act in the best interests of the company.

In the light of the above, Wepa Italia S.r.l. as Guarantor and any Italian guarantor shall not undertake to
guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in part, to purchase their shares or quota (or
the shares or quota of any of their direct or indirect holding companies) and which would therefore constitute
the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may
be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by
Italian courts.

_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and
security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential
challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or
avoidance or clawback of the Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or
clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”).
For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an
insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws” above.

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts
received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the granting of any security interest or
guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may
not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or
there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders
could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.


-----

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general
may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

   - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to
or affecting the rights of creditors;

   - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

   - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each
party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to
perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of
Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

   - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of
Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or
may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

   - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

   - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter
in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such
opinion is based on reasonable grounds;

   - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione
_necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_
Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application
of such legal concepts under Italian law;

   - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement
or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would
survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

   - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

   - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument
may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation
pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

   - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in
order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the
interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties
following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

   - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for
the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian
Civil Code are satisfied;

   - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest
being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

   - in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is
appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors’
committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the
enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the
relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by
the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value
returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate;


-----

   - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which
the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of
seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend,
moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and
until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/
bankruptcy proceedings;

   - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to
the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date
(data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring
that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant
document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the
document;

   - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

   - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by
Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of
mandatory provisions;

   - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

   - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian
company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among
others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate
permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended
from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest
deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including
Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be
capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest
were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the
relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian
Banking Act )) may not be enforceable;

   - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other
parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties
as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

   - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

   - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from
continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge;
and

   - in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or judicial liquidation of the
grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to
any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial
liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and, as
a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the
pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on
the pledged quotas/shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can
be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a
clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to article 2901 of the Italian civil code (which results
in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and
other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could
revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the
prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

   - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting
creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was
fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit;


-----

   - that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if
the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in
the fraudulent design.

Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or invalidate
all or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if payment had already
been made under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return the payment to the relevant
guarantor, if the court found that, inter alia:

i. the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its current
or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or when the beneficiary of
the guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave the relevant
guarantee;

ii. the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its
guarantee or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given;

iii. the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not to
be in the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or

iv. the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction was
to the detriment of the creditors.

If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it
unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect
to the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.

_Holders’ representative_

Under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the relevant
security document. Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over time of the names of the
individual holder of the Notes, Italian security documents are created in favor of a “Holders’ representative”
of the Notes on behalf of the holders of the Notes and in favor of the Security Agent as representative of all
secured creditors. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security
interest can be created and perfected in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither
directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant
share certificates and corporate documents or public registries.

Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the Italian law governed
security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes (in
relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not
perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created under the Italian law
governed security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest.

To address the above potential issue, any Notes Collateral governed by Italian law will be granted and perfected
in favor of the Holders’ representative acting also in its capacity as legal representative (“mandatario con
_rappresentanza”) of the holders of the Notes._

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt”. Pursuant to the parallel debt
claim and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and to applicable law, the Security Agent, in its
individual capacity acting in its own name and not as agent or representative of the holders of the Notes, shall
become the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. However, investors
should note that the enforceability of Italian law governed security interests granted in favor of the creditor of
a parallel debt has not been tested before the Italian courts and, therefore, there is no certainty that the parallel
debt will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability by the holders of the Notes of any collateral
securing the Notes governed by Italian law.

**POLAND**

**_Overview_**

Wepa Piechowice Sp. z o.o. (the “Polish Guarantor”), being a Polish limited liability company (Polish: spółka
_z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.) is incorporated and existing under the laws of Poland. Comments_
made below are relevant for the Polish limited liability company.


-----

In the event of insolvency of the Polish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Poland. Note,
however, that if the center of main interest of the Polish Guarantor is situated in another European Union
member state, the courts of that state shall have jurisdiction and the insolvency laws of that state shall apply
pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015,
on insolvency proceedings (Official Journal No. L 141 of June 5, 2015).

If the center of main interest of the Polish Guarantor is situated in Poland, the insolvency proceedings would
be governed by the Bankruptcy Law (Polish: Prawo Upadłościowe) of February 28, 2003 (consolidated text:
Journal of Laws of 2022, item 1520, as amended) (the “Bankruptcy Law”), and a Restructuring Law (Polish:
Prawo Restrukturyzacyjne) of May 15, 2015 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2022, item 2309, as
amended) (the “Restructuring Law”).

Please find below the general and non-exhaustive description of certain provisions of the Bankruptcy Law
and the Restructuring Law.

Note that the Bankruptcy Law and the Restructuring Law may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors
as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain
interest after the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the duration of the insolvency proceedings,
and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes and the Guarantees to an extent
exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

Now in Poland the government works on certain amendments to the Polish insolvency regime connecting
with implementation of the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20
June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on
measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt,
and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency).

The current provisions of the Polish insolvency law are largely in line with the basic terms of the Directive.
Provisions that still need to be implemented concern, inter alia, the scope of suspension of individual
enforcement actions, approval of a restructuring plan against the objection of a group of creditors, as well as
protection of new financing, interim financing and other restructuring-related transactions.

The planned date for implementation of the Directive and entry into force of the amendments is March 2024.

**_Insolvent debtor_**

Bankruptcy proceedings under Polish law may be initiated against insolvent debtors.

The debtor is deemed insolvent if it loses the ability to settle its due and payable financial liabilities (which will
be presumed to be the case if a delay in payment exceeds three months).

Under the balance sheet test (for a debtor being a legal person, e.g. a limited liability company), the debtor will
be deemed insolvent if according to its balance sheet, its financial obligations (except for future liabilities,
including liabilities subject to a suspensory condition, and shareholder loans or other legal act having the
similar effects made within five years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy and also expect for liabilities
arising from capital instruments and subordinated loans issued or incurred for the purpose of qualifying for
own funds as additional instruments) exceed the value of their assets and this “negative surplus”continues for
longer than twenty four consecutive months. Note that even if the above conditions are met, the court may
reject a bankruptcy petition, provided that there is no threat to the debtor’s ability to perform its due and
payable obligations in a short term.

**_Bankruptcy petition_**

Bankruptcy proceedings are initiated upon submitting a bankruptcy petition. Such a petition may be
submitted by either the debtor or its personal creditors. In connection with the amendment of the regulations
of October 13, 2022 and the introduction of the so-called holding law, i.e., new provisions that regulate groups
of companies, the entity entitled to submit a petition is also the parent company—in relation to the subsidiary
company participating in the group of companies.

According to the Bankruptcy Law, the catalogue of persons authorized and obliged to submit a bankruptcy
petition for the debtor has been determined, inter alia, as all persons who on the basis of the law, articles of
association/statute of the company have the right to conduct the company’s affairs and to represent it
(e.g., each member of the management board is individually authorized and obliged to submit a bankruptcy


-----

petition). The deadline for submitting the bankruptcy petition is thirty days from the date on which the
reason for bankruptcy occurred.

Note that persons obliged to submit the bankruptcy petition (e.g., management board members) may be held
liable for damages resulting from a delay in submitting the petition to the court. Polish law provides a number
of consequences for failure to comply with this obligation, including personal liability for debts not satisfied
by the company, a ban on conducting economic activity, and even criminal or tax liability.

A member of the management board of an insolvent limited-liability company may be relieved of personal
liability for the company’s obligations if, within the time provided by law for filing a bankruptcy petition, i.e.,
within 30 days after insolvency arises, a restructuring procedure was opened or an arrangement was approved
in a procedure for approval of an arrangement.

The court is obliged to refuse to initiate bankruptcy proceedings if the debtor’s assets are insufficient to cover
the cost of the proceedings or, additionally if the debtor’s assets are sufficient to cover only the cost of the
proceedings. The court may also reject the petition to declare bankruptcy if the debtor’s assets are encumbered
with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge or maritime mortgage to such a degree that the
debtor’s remaining assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of the proceedings.

**_Safeguard procedure before the bankruptcy proceedings_**

Upon receiving a bankruptcy petition, the court can, ex officio or upon a motion, secure the debtor’s assets.

The court may also secure the debtor’s assets, inter alia, through the appointment of an interim court
supervisor (Polish: tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy) or a mandatory administrator (Polish: zarządca
_przymusowy), and suspend the execution proceedings against the debtor (and additionally the court may_
revoke seizure of a bank account).

**_Bankruptcy proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, there is one uniform bankruptcy proceedings, i.e., liquidation bankruptcy
proceedings.

Upon acceptance of the bankruptcy petition, the court decides whether to initiate the bankruptcy proceedings.
This decision shall be made within two months of submitting the bankruptcy petition, however this deadline
is only of instructive nature.

The date of the bankruptcy is the date on which the bankruptcy order is issued by the court.

As a rule, upon the court declaring liquidation bankruptcy, the debtor loses its right to manage its assets and
a bankruptcy receiver (Polish: syndyk masy upadło´sci) is appointed. The financial liabilities of the debtor that
have not yet become due and payable, become due and payable on the day the bankruptcy order is issued. The
debtor’s assets become the bankruptcy estate to be used to settle the debtor’s creditors. The bankruptcy estate
is managed by a bankruptcy receiver appointed by the court. Consent of the creditors’ committee (Polish:
_zgromadzenie wierzycieli) or the bankruptcy receiver responsible for administering the bankruptcy is required_
for specified decisions made in relation to some matters connected with the bankruptcy process.

As a rule, the preferred type of liquidation under the Bankruptcy Law is the sale of the bankrupt’s business as
a whole.

Creditors have the right to submit their claims within thirty days from the announcement of the bankruptcy
order; claims may be submitted also after the lapse of the set deadline, however, all actions undertaken in the
bankruptcy proceedings until that date are valid towards the creditor. If a claim is not included in the list
prepared by a court receiver, the creditor has the right to appeal. The procedural requirements for submitting
claims are very formal.

**_Prepared liquidation (so called “pre-pack”)_**

The Bankruptcy Law provides for an institution called prepared liquidation (Polish: przygotowana likwidacja),
also called “pre pack”.

In the pre pack procedure, the bankruptcy petition may be accompanied by an application for approval of the
terms of sale of a debtor’s enterprise, its organized part or assets representing a major part of its enterprise.
Nevertheless, it may not include assets secured with registered pledge if the registered pledge agreement
provides for foreclosure of the assets or their sale to satisfy a pledgee’s claims (unless a pledgee gives its
consent).


-----

Such application for approval of terms of sale must specify at least the sale price and a potential purchaser,
and be accompanied by a valuation report prepared by a certified court expert.

It is possible to request that the debtor’s enterprise will be handed over to the purchaser on the bankruptcy
declaration day, in which case the full price will have to be paid in advance to the court’s deposit account.
Note that the sale to an affiliated company of the debtor is permissible only at a price not lower than the price
indicated in the valuation report.

The court is obliged to accept the application if the offered price is higher than the estimated liquidation
proceeds that could be raised in “standard” bankruptcy proceedings, less the estimated costs of the
proceedings. If the offered price is lower than (but still close to) the estimated net liquidation proceeds, the
court will still be in a position to approve the sale if it is supported by an “important social interest” or if it
allows the distressed enterprise to be preserved.

The court’s decision to dismiss the pre-pack application may be appealed by the debtor and the applicant,
whereas the decision approving pre-packed sale may be appealed by the debtor and each of the creditors. The
appeal may be lodged within two weeks from the date of publication of the said decision in the National
Register of Debtors.

**_Ineffectiveness of some legal acts with respect to the bankruptcy estate_**

Following the declaration of bankruptcy, the bankrupt’s assets become the bankruptcy estate, which serves to
satisfy the claims of the bankrupt’s creditors. The bankruptcy estate covers, subject to exceptions, the assets
belonging to the insolvent debtor on the date of the bankruptcy or acquired by it during the bankruptcy
proceedings. The Bankruptcy Law lists assets that are excluded from the bankruptcy estate by virtue of law,
while other assets of the debtor can be excluded from the bankruptcy estate by a resolution of the creditors’
committee or through the proceedings reviewed by the judge commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz).

Under the Bankruptcy Law, contractual provisions which provide for a change or termination of a legal
relationship, to which the bankrupt is a party to, due to the declaration of bankruptcy (or in the case of filling
a petition for bankruptcy), are null and void. Furthermore, contractual provisions, which make it impossible
or difficult to achieve the objective of the bankruptcy proceedings, are ineffective towards the bankruptcy
estate.

Legal transactions are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if concluded by the bankrupt within one year
preceding the day, on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted and resulting in the bankrupt disposing of
its assets: (i) without any reciprocal consideration for the bankrupt or (ii) bankrupt’s consideration
significantly exceeds the value of the consideration received by the bankrupt or reserved for the bankrupt or
a third party.

Also ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate is granting of collateral for an undue debt and the payment of
such debt effected by the insolvent debtor in six months preceding the day, on which the bankruptcy petition
was submitted. The beneficiaries of such actions may, however, aim to have these transactions considered
effective, if they have not been aware of grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy while receiving payment or
being granted the collateral.

Moreover, in relation to non-gratuitous legal transactions concluded by an insolvent legal person with its
shareholders, representatives (including their spouses), as well as affiliated companies, their shareholders or
representatives (including their spouses) executed within six months before the day on which the bankruptcy
petition was submitted, the judge commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz) is entitled to declare them ineffective
(ex officio or upon a motion) unless the party to such legal transaction demonstrates that such transaction
was not to the creditors’ detriment.

In addition, a transfer of future receivable is ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if such receivable arises
after the declaration of bankruptcy, unless the agreement on the transfer of receivable was concluded in
writing with a certified date (Polish: forma pisemna z datą pewną) at least six months before the day on which
the bankruptcy petition was submitted.

Mortgages, pledges, registered pledges or maritime mortgages established by the bankrupt within one year
preceding the day on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted may be challenged in one of the following
situations: (i) the bankrupt was not the personal debtor of the creditor (e.g. if the debtor was a guarantor) and
the bankrupt did not receive any consideration in connection with such security, (ii) the consideration received
was substantially lower than the value of the security, or (iii) the security interests was established for the
benefit of its shareholders, representatives (including their spouses), as well as affiliated companies, their


-----

shareholders or representatives (including their spouses). The judge commissioner, acting upon a motion, is
competent to decide on the ineffectiveness of the established security towards the bankruptcy estate, however
in case described in point (iii) above it is obliged to decide on such ineffectiveness unless the party to such legal
transaction demonstrates that it was not to the creditors’ detriment.

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, the judge commissioner, is authorized to deem ineffective towards the
bankruptcy estate any contractual penalty (reserved for non-performance or improper performance of
obligations) if the obligation was already performed to a large extent or the contractual penalty is excessive.

The transfer of the ownership title to a thing, claim or other right to the creditor (Polish: przewłaszczenie na
_zabezpieczenie) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate if such agreement has been made in writing with a_
certified date.

A credit agreement expires on the date bankruptcy is declared if prior to that date the lender did not disburse
the funds to the bankrupt. The lender may pursue a claim in the bankruptcy proceedings for compensation by
filing the claim with the judge commissioner. If only a portion of the funds was disbursed to the bankrupt
prior to the date of declaring bankruptcy, the bankrupt loses the right to request the disbursement of the
remaining balance.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not affect the bankrupt’s bank account agreement, securities account
agreement, account agreement for derivatives, clearing account or collective account agreement.

**_Other selected consequences of bankruptcy_**

After the declaration of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy estate, as a general rule, cannot be encumbered with a
mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime mortgage in order to secure a liability
incurred before the declaration of bankruptcy. Additionally, it is forbidden to encumber the bankruptcy estate
with a compulsory mortgage or a treasury pledge in order to secure a liability that arises after the declaration
of bankruptcy.

The effectiveness of contractual subordination arrangements under Polish law is not definitively established
either in legislation or in the case law. The contractual subordination of claims will be binding between the
relevant parties (in accordance with and subject to governing law) but will not be recognized by an insolvency
officer (in the event of insolvency proceedings in Poland) or a court bailiff (in the event of court enforcement
proceedings in Poland), who will be bound by the statutory order of payments and ranking of claims.

Declaration of bankruptcy proceedings affects current court or administrative proceedings and debt collection
proceedings. After declaration of the bankruptcy order, courts and administrative proceedings related to the
bankruptcy estate may be opened and continued only by a bankruptcy receiver or against him. Enforcement
proceeding concerning a claim subject to filing to the bankruptcy estate, opened before the bankruptcy has
been declared, shall be stayed by the virtue of law as at the date bankruptcy is declared. Enforcement
proceeding shall be discontinued by the virtue of law after the decision declaring bankruptcy becomes final.

**_Satisfaction of claims in bankruptcy proceedings_**

In the case of bankruptcy, settling the creditors’ claims is usually only possible upon the registration of the
claims by the bankruptcy receiver. The claims are satisfied according to certain priorities. The costs of
bankruptcy proceedings are covered by separate legal provision, which sets out that costs of bankruptcy
proceedings shall be satisfied on an ongoing basis during the process of liquidation, with priority over the first
category claims. Claims described in the below categories are settled only after all costs of the bankruptcy
proceedings, debts of bankruptcy estate have been settled.

Unsecured creditors’ claims are settled in the following order (as far as a legal person is concerned):

   - first category—this category, inter alia, covers claims arising out of an employment relationship
falling due and payable before the bankruptcy was declared, with certain exceptions, certain
contributions to the social security insurance system, certain claims which arise during restructuring
proceedings, claims arising from credit, loans, bonds, guarantees or letters of credit or other
financing arrangement provided in the approved restructuring proceedings and granted in
connection with the performance of such arrangement (if the bankruptcy was declared as a
recognition of a bankruptcy petition submitted not later than three months after the final repeal of
such restructuring arrangement).


-----

   - second category—covers claims not covered in other categories including claims payable to private
creditors as well as tax liabilities, other public levies and contributions to the social security insurance
system. Thus, private creditors are treated equally with tax authorities.

   - third category—covers subordinated interest on claims included in the senior categories in the order,
in which they are paid on the capital, as well as judicial and administrative fines and claims arising
under donations and legacies.

   - fourth category—covers shareholders’ claims arising from loan agreements as well as other legal
transactions with similar effects, which were executed within five years before the bankruptcy
announcement was made, including interest (with some exceptions).

Settling claims from one of these categories is only possible after fully settling claims of the creditors from a
more senior category. If settling all debts included in the same category is not possible due to lack of assets,
the debts should be settled proportionally.

The liquidation of the bankruptcy estate is performed by selling the bankrupt’s enterprise as a whole or by
organized parts, by selling all immovable and movable property, by enforcing claims against the debtors of the
bankrupt, and by exercising other proprietary rights included in the bankruptcy estate or by alienation thereof.

The Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between three types of sale (i.e., at an arm’s length basis, at an auction or
at a tender). The sale (transfer) of receivables is permissible. As stated above, as a rule, the bankrupt’s enterprise
should be sold as a whole.

Proceeds obtained from the liquidation of assets, liabilities and rights encumbered with a mortgage, a pledge
or security transfer of title, registered pledge, treasury pledge, maritime mortgages are allocated to settle
creditors’ claims that are secured by such assets, liabilities or rights (subject to certain exceptions). Proceeds
remaining after settling those creditors’ claims are included in the bankruptcy estate and satisfied in
accordance with categories of claims specified above. The foreclosure of the object encumbered with registered
pledge or financial pledge is generally permitted if the relevant agreement provides for such method of
satisfaction of creditor’s claim. However, the foreclosure is not allowed if such object is the part of bankrupt’s
enterprise and the sale of such object with the rest of the enterprise is more beneficial than its separate sale.

The proceedings will be closed by the court upon the performance of the final distribution plan. The court
also orders termination of bankruptcy proceedings if all creditors have been satisfied in the course of the
proceedings. The court shall discontinue the bankruptcy proceeding if (i) the property that remains after
excluding the bankrupt’s assets encumbered with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, tax pledge or marine
mortgage is not sufficient to satisfy the costs of proceedings (ii) creditors that were obliged by a resolution of
the meeting of creditors or decision of the judge in charge of bankruptcy proceedings to make an advance
payment on account of the costs of proceedings fail to make such payment in due time and there are no other
liquid funds to cover such costs (iii) all creditors who declared their claim seek discontinuation of proceedings
and the bankrupt entity agree to that. In some cases, liquidation may be avoided through arrangement with
creditors and the company can continue to operate.

**_Debts currency and interest due in the bankruptcy proceedings_**

Any debt payable in a currency other than Polish zloty (such as euro), if being put on the list of debts, must be
converted into Polish zloty at the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate for the date the bankruptcy
court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the debt has fallen due or not).
Nevertheless, an inclusion of a debt payable in currency other than Polish zloty in the list of bankruptcy
claims does not result in conversion of such claim into claim denominated in Polish zloty.

Furthermore, in case of unsecured claims, interest is satisfied from the assets of the bankruptcy estate only for
the time period until the date the bankruptcy is declared.

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

In order to enable insolvent or threatened with insolvency debtors to recover their ability to overcome financial
difficulties, rather than declare bankruptcy, four types of restructuring proceedings are provided by the
Restructuring Law:

   - proceedings for approval of an arrangement (Polish: postępowanie o zatwierdzenie układu),

   - accelerated arrangement proceedings (Polish: przyspieszone postępowanie układowe),

   - arrangement proceedings (Polish: postępowanie układowe),


-----

   - remedial proceedings (Polish: postępowanie sanacyjne).

The above proceedings are aimed at the debtor concluding an arrangement with its creditors (including partial
arrangements), which enable the debtor to satisfy the creditors’ claims and operate further. The difference in
the said proceedings is in the scope of the debtor’s rights to manage its assets, and the scope of the debtors’
protection against the creditors. Proceedings, subject to certain exceptions, are initiated by the debtor only
(however also a personal creditor is entitled to file a petition for the commencement of remedial proceedings
in relation to an insolvent legal person).

The creditors may vote in single or separate groups. If creditors vote in a single group, the arrangement is
concluded if it is accepted by the majority of voting creditors who hold in aggregate at least two thirds of the
total sum of claims held by the voting creditors.

The creditors may be split into separate groups (classes) based on the criteria of “common category of
interests”. In such case, the arrangement is concluded if it is accepted in each group by a majority of voting
creditors in the group whose claims amount to (in aggregate) at least two thirds of the total sum of claims held
by the voting group members. Even if there is no required majority in one or more of the groups of creditors,
the arrangement will still be deemed concluded if: (i) the creditors representing in aggregate at least two thirds
of the total sum of claims held by the voting creditors have voted in favor of the arrangement, and (ii) the
creditors from the dissenting group/groups are satisfied through the arrangement to an extent which is not
less favorable than in the case of liquidation of the debtor.

An arrangement accepted by the required majority of creditors is subject to an approval by the court. The
court rejects the arrangement if: (i) it violates the law or (ii) it is obvious that the arrangement will not be
performed. The court is also entitled to reject the arrangement if it is obviously detrimental to creditors who
voted against it and raised objections. The accepted arrangement is binding on all creditors, whose receivables
are, under the law, covered by the arrangement, which may include claims not specified on the creditor’s list.

In case of conflicting petitions for bankruptcy and for restructuring, the court withholds the bankruptcy
petition and the restructuring petition should be considered first (if the restructuring petition is accepted, it
will not be possible to declare bankruptcy as long as restructuring proceedings are pending). Exceptionally, if
the withholding of the bankruptcy petition should be contrary to the interest of all creditors, the bankruptcy
court may decide to consider both petitions at the same time.

As a general rule, the arrangement covers, subject to some exceptions, all personal claims against the debtor
originated prior to the commencement of the restructuring proceedings (the day of issuing a court’s decision
on the opening of accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings and/or remedial
proceedings (the “Commencement Date”), in case of proceedings for approval of an arrangement the
consequences of commencing the restructuring proceedings take effect from the arrangement day), together
with interest accruing from the Commencement Date, as well as conditional claims, if the condition fulfils
when the arrangement is being performed. Above relates both to financial and non-financial claims (except
for inter alia, claims under employment agreements or claims for the handover of property). If a creditor
objects to the restructuring of its non-financial claim (or if due the nature of a non-financial claim, it is not
possible to restructure it), the relevant claim will be converted to a financial one (with effect from the
Commencement Date). In addition, claims under reciprocal agreements (Polish: umowy wzajemne) which
have not been executed in whole or in part before the Commencement Date are covered by the arrangement
only if: (i) the counterparty’s performance is divisible and (ii) only to the extent that the counterparty has
performed the agreement prior to the Commencement Date of the restructuring proceedings and has not
received a reciprocal consideration from the debtor.

Restructuring proceedings, as in the case of bankruptcy proceedings, have been conducted since December 1,
2021 within the National Debtors Register (Polish: Krajowy Rejestr Zadłu˙zonych), an IT system in which the
files of proceedings are maintained in electronic form and via which voting on arrangements is conducted.
The National Debtors Register is also used for filing all applications in the proceedings, voting at the creditors’
meeting and conducting insolvency searches by everyone in Poland. In addition, the provisions of the
Restructuring Law allow the organization of virtual creditors’ meetings.

**“Partial” arrangements**

The debtor may enter into a “partial” arrangement (Polish: układ częściowy) only with selected classes of
creditors (e.g., secured creditors or significant suppliers), however, it is permitted only in (i) an arrangement
approval proceeding and (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings. It should allow the debtor to reach an
arrangement in a faster and more discreet way. However, the selection of creditors for that purpose must be


-----

compliant with statutory tests (i.e., it must be based on objective, unambiguous and economically justified
criteria) and must not be only aimed at eliminating dissenting creditors from relevant voting classes.

**_Impact of restructuring proceedings on certain agreements_**

Contractual provisions, according to which termination or modification of legal relationship, is triggered by
submitting a petition for the commencement of restructuring proceedings or commencement of such
proceedings are void by virtue of law. Also, the terms of agreements with the debtor which make it impossible
or difficult to achieve the purposes of restructuring proceedings (except for arrangement approval
proceedings), are ineffective against the debtor’s estate.

In principle, upon the commencement of restructuring proceedings, it is prohibited to terminate certain
agreements which constitute source of incomes for the debtor (unless the board of creditors agrees for the
termination), such as tenancy or lease agreements relating to the premises in which the debtor’s enterprise is
operated, property insurances, facility agreements (but only in relation to funds made available to the debtor
before the Commencement Date), leasing agreements, bank account agreements, suretyships, licences granted
to the debtor, guarantees and letters of credit issued before the Commencement Date.

**_Preservation of security interests in restructuring proceedings_**

As a rule, it is not possible to establish new security interests to secure a claim not covered by the arrangement
(unless the board of creditors agrees otherwise) once the restructuring proceedings have commenced.
However, if an application to register a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge or maritime
mortgage is filed more than six months before submitting a petition to commence restructuring proceedings,
the mortgage or pledge will be registered (in accelerated arrangement, arrangement and remedial proceedings).

Also, according to a general rule, in rem security interests (e.g., mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, security
assignment) securing a claim not covered by the arrangement survive the restructuring proceedings and the
claims secured by any of such security interests are not affected by the arrangement. Hence, the arrangement
covers secured claims to the extent such claims are not covered by the value of collateral, or the relevant
secured creditors agree to be covered by the arrangement. Secured creditors consenting to the arrangement
may be assigned to a separate group (class) of creditors and be afforded different treatment in the
arrangements from the one of unsecured creditors.

However, if the debtor presents arrangement proposals to a secured creditor providing for full satisfaction of
the creditor’s claims within the time limit specified in the arrangement, together with incidental claims
provided for in the agreement under which the security was established, even if the agreement has been
effectively terminated or has expired, or providing for satisfaction of the creditor to a degree not lower than
what could be expected from enforcing the claim and incidentals out of the collateral, the consent of such
creditor is not necessary for the claim to be covered by the arrangement by operation of law.

**_Proceedings for approval of an arrangement_**

These proceedings are available if the sum of disputed claims does not exceed fifteen per cent of the total
claims held by creditors entitled to vote. The proceedings for approval of an arrangement include:

   - Conclusion by the debtor of an agreement with a restructuring adviser (arrangement supervisor),

   - Publication by the arrangement supervisor of a notice on setting of the arrangement date in the
National Debtors Register (optional action),

   - Solicitation of votes by the arrangement supervisor (voting on the arrangement),

   - The debtor’s submission of an application to the court to approve the arrangement,

   - Issuance by the court of an order approving the arrangement.

The proceeding for approval of an arrangement is mostly conducted outside of court. The court becomes
involved only upon filing of the application to approve the arrangement.

The proceedings are opened automatically by virtue of a unilateral action of a debtor (without any
involvement of the court)—i.e., upon concluding by the debtor an agreement on supervising the procedure
with a chosen supervisor (a licensed restructuring advisor). Subsequently, the debtor sets the arrangement
date as of which the creditors’ rights to vote on the arrangement are determined. Claims arising after the
arrangement date are not covered by the arrangement.


-----

Once the proceedings are initiated, the supervisor may publish a notice on setting of the arrangement date in
the National Debtors Register. The debtor enjoys far-reaching protection against execution: during the period
from publication of the notice setting the arrangement date, execution proceedings pending against the debtor
are stayed by operation of law, and new execution proceedings may not be initiated. Actions by the debtor
outside the ordinary course of business require the consent of the arrangement supervisor to be valid.

There is a ban on termination of key contracts, such as leases on premises or real estate where the debtor
operates its business, credit agreements with respect to funds transferred to the debtor before announcement
of the arrangement date, and other contracts of fundamental importance for conducting the debtor’s business.

In proceedings for approval of an arrangement, the ban on payment of claims covered by the arrangement
does not apply—unlike in other types of restructuring proceedings, where there is such a ban.

Creditors may apply to the court to set aside in their entirety the effects of announcement of establishment of
the arrangement date, including the ban on execution against the debtor’s assets, if they will cause injury to
the creditors.

An application for approval of the arrangement must be filed with the court no later than four months after
the announcement establishing the arrangement date. If the application is not filed within this time, the effects
of the announcement will expire (the proceeding for approval of the arrangement will continue, but without
the protective consequences and without restrictions on debtor’s management).

**_Accelerated arrangement proceedings_**

Similarly, to proceedings for approval of an arrangement, these proceedings are available if the sum of
disputed claims also does not exceed fifteen per cent of the total claims held by creditors entitled to vote. It
may be used, in particular, if there is a large number of creditors and the debtor is unable to collect their votes
on the arrangement by itself.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for the acceptance and approval of the arrangement together with
a statement that information included therein is true and complete. The court issues a decision whether to
accept and approve the arrangement within one week from submitting the petition and appoints (i) a court
supervisor (Polish: nadzorca sądowy), who will supervise the debtor’s management of its assets and (ii) a judge
commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz), who inter alia will manage the restructuring proceedings, supervise
the activity of the court supervisor and—if applicable—(iii) the administrator. If the court refuses to
commence accelerated arrangement proceedings, the debtor may lodge a complaint against it. The creditors,
in turn, may lodge a complaint against the commencement of the accelerated arrangement proceedings.

Within 2 weeks from the date on which the accelerated arrangement proceedings are commenced, the court
supervisor prepares and submits to the judge commissioner (i) a restructuring plan, (ii) a list of claims and
(iii) a list of disputed claims providing them with (i) arrangement proposals, (ii) information on division of the
creditors on the grounds of their category of interests, as well as on (iii) a manner of way of voting at the
creditors’ meeting. Subsequently, the judge commissioner sets the date of the creditors’ meeting for the
purpose of voting on the arrangement and informs of that date the creditors, who are on the list of claims.

The debtor continues to manage its assets under the supervision of the court supervisor (optionally the court
may appoint an administrator (Polish: zarządca) to take over the management of the arrangement estate) but
the debtor is required to obtain the supervisor’s consent for all transactions and actions exceeding the scope of
the ordinary course of business, as otherwise those transactions and actions are null and void (the consent
may be also issued by the supervisor within 30 days upon such transaction—ex post ratification procedure).
The court may revoke the debtor’s management of assets and establish an administrator if: (i) the debtor does
not comply with the judge commissioner’s or the court supervisor’s directions, (ii) its management does not
guarantee the performance of the arrangement or if a trustee (Polish: kurator) has been appointed for the
debtor or (iii) the debtor’s management does not comply with law (whether intentionally or not) to the
detriment (actual or potential) of the creditors.

In addition, once the accelerated arrangement proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) the estate which
enables the debtor to operate its undertaking and the debtor’s estate become the arrangement estate (Polish:
_masa układowa), (ii) the debtor provides the judge commissioner and the court supervisor with information_
and documents concerning the debtor’s undertaking and assets, (iii) execution proceedings relating to claims
covered by the arrangement are suspended by virtue of law, (iv) the debtor/administrator may not settle
performances from the claims, which are covered by the arrangement when the proceedings are pending (to
some extend this rule does not apply to contractual compensation clauses (Polish: klauzula kompensacyjna)).


-----

**_Arrangement proceedings_**

These proceedings are available only for the debtors, whose disputed claims exceed fifteen per cent of the total
claims held by creditors entitled to vote and, as a result, both types of previous proceedings cannot be initiated.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for the acceptance and approval of the arrangement without
attaching the arrangement proposals. The debtor needs to demonstrate in the petition the probability of
settling by the debtor the costs of the proceedings and fulfilling liabilities which will arise after the
commencement of arrangement proceedings. In principle, the court issues a decision whether to accept and
approve the arrangement within two weeks from submitting the petition (this period may be extended to six
weeks if it is necessary to conduct a trial).

The court also appoints a court supervisor (Polish: nadzorca sądowy), who will supervise the debtor’s
management of its assets and a judge commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz), who will manage the
restructuring proceedings and supervise the activities of the court supervisor and, if applicable, the
administrator (Polish: zarządca).

The court may: (i) secure the debtor’s assets through the appointment of an interim court supervisor (Polish:
_tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy) for the period between the filing of the petition and the commencement of the_
proceedings, (ii) suspend pending enforcement proceedings conducted in order to enforce claims covered with
the arrangement and (iii) revoke the seizure of the debtor’s bank account at the request of the debtor or the
interim court supervisor. The debtor or the creditor who is in the course of conducting the enforcement may
lodge a complaint against the court’s decision to suspend pending enforcement proceedings and to revoke the
seizure of the debtor’s bank account. If the court decides to revoke the seizure of the debtor’s bank account,
it needs to appoint an interim court supervisor, who will give consent to the debtor’s dispositions regarding
the sums maintained on this bank account.

Within thirty days from the commencement of the arrangement proceedings, the court supervisor: (i) prepares
and submits to the judge commissioner a restructuring plan and a list of claims, (ii) determines the
composition of the arrangement estate (Polish: masa układowa) by preparing a specification of inventory
(Polish: spis inwentarza) together with an estimation of the arrangement estate. Upon the receipt of the
restructuring plan and the list of claims, the judge commissioner sets the date of the creditors’ meeting for the
purpose of voting on the arrangement and informs the creditors of that date providing them with
(i) arrangement proposals, (ii) information on division of the creditors on the grounds of their category of
interests as well as on (iii) a manner of way of voting at the creditors’ meeting.

The debtor continues to manage its assets under the supervision of the court supervisor (optionally the court
may appoint an administrator to take over the management of the arrangement estate) but the debtor is
required to obtain the supervisor’s consent for all transactions and actions exceeding the scope of the ordinary
course of business, as otherwise those transactions and actions are null and void (the consent may be also
issued by the supervisor within 30 days upon such transaction-ex post ratification procedure). The court may
revoke the debtor’s management if: (i) the debtor does not comply with the judge commissioner’s directions,
(ii) its management does not guarantee the performance of the arrangement or (iii) its management does not
comply with the law (whether intentionally or not) to the detriment (actual or potential) of the creditors.

In addition, once the arrangement proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) execution proceedings relating
to claims covered by the arrangement are suspended by virtue of law, (ii) the creditors may initiate judicial,
administrative or judicial administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts (Polish: sądy
_polubowne) regarding satisfaction of claims disclosed in the specification of inventory, (iii) the court supervisor_
accedes by virtue of law to pending judicial, administrative or judicial administrative proceedings or
proceedings before arbitration courts regarding the arrangement estate.

**_Remedial proceedings_**

This type of proceedings provides for the broadest scope of restructuring activities and protection against
creditors. Unlike other types of restructuring proceedings, it may be also initiated by the debtor’s personal
creditor (Polish: wierzyciel osobisty) provided that debtor has become insolvent and is not only threatened
with the insolvency or a trustee (Polish: kurator), if appointed by the registry court.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for commencing remedial proceedings. The debtor needs to
demonstrate in the petition the probability of settling by the debtor the costs of the proceedings and fulfilling
liabilities which will arise after the commencement of remedial proceedings. The court may secure the debtor’s
assets through the appointment of an interim court supervisor (Polish: tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy) or an


-----

interim administrator (Polish: tymczasowy zarządca) for the period between the filing of the petition and the
commencement of the proceedings. In principle, the court issues a decision whether to commence remedial
proceedings within two weeks from submitting the petition (this period may be extended to six weeks if it is
necessary to conduct a hearing). The court appoints a judge commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz), who will
manage the proceedings and supervise the activities of the administrator (Polish: zarządca). The appointment
of an administrator to manage the debtor’s estate (remedial estate) is mandatory unless the debtor’s
involvement is necessary to conduct successful restructuring and the debtor guarantees proper management
(in which case the court may agree to the debtor’s retaining management over the whole or a part of the
undertaking).

Once the court issues the decision on the commencement of remedial proceedings, the debtor is obliged to
pass the whole estate and documents related thereto to the administrator (unless the debtor has been given the
right to manage its assets), and provide the judge commissioner and the administrator with all necessary or
required information. Subsequently the administrator, in cooperation with the debtor, submits a restructuring
plan to the judge commissioner within thirty days from the commencement of the proceedings (this period
may be extended to three months), who accepts and approves the restructuring plan upon obtaining, the
opinion of the board of creditors (Polish: rada wierzycieli). After obtaining the approval, the administrator
performs the restructuring plan.

In addition, once the remedial proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) commercial power of attorney
(Polish: prokura) and other powers of attorney granted by the debtor expire by virtue of law (in the course of
remedial proceedings new commercial power of attorney or powers of attorney may be granted by the
administrator), (ii) the administrator is granted the right to “cherry-pick” so-called mutual contracts (Polish:
_umowy wzajemne) which have not been performed in full or in part prior to the Commencement Date, subject_
to the judge commissioner’s consent. (ii) the estate which enables the debtor to operate and the debtor’s estate
becomes the remedial estate (Polish: masa sanacyjna), whose components are determined by the administrator
by means of preparing a specification of inventory (Polish: spis inwentarza) together with an estimation of the
remedial estate (Polish: ustalenie składu masy sanacyjnej), within thirty days from the commencement of the
proceedings, (iii) it is possible to adjust the employment level to the needs of the reorganized undertaking,
(iv) opened inheritance to which the debtor is appointed, is included in the remedial estate, (v) pending
enforcement proceedings relating to remedial estate are suspended by virtue of law, (vi) the creditors may
initiate judicial, administrative or judicial administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts
(Polish: sądy polubowne) which regard satisfaction of claims disclosed in the specification of inventory,
(vii) judicial, administrative or judicial administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts
regarding the remedial estate may be initiated by or conducted against the administrator, in such case the
administrator acts in his/her own name but on behalf of the debtor, (viii) at the request of the debtor, the
judge commissioner may revoke the seizure of elements included in the remedial estate in the course of
enforcement or proceedings aimed at securing claims (Polish: postępowanie zabezpieczające), if such elements
are necessary for the debtor to operate.

Also, certain legal transactions are ineffective towards the remedial estate once the remedial proceedings are
commenced. These are: (i) transactions by means of which the debtor has disposed of its assets, if they were
concluded by the debtor within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement of the
remedial proceedings was submitted and the value of the debtor’s performance (Polish: świadczenie)
significantly exceeds the value of the performance received by or reserved for the debtor, (ii) security interests,
which have not been established directly in connection with receiving a performance by the debtor within one
year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings was submitted
(iii) security interests, which have been established by the debtor within one year preceding the day, on which
the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings was submitted in the extent such security interests
exceed more than the half of the value of secured performance received by or reserved for the debtor together
with claims for ancillary claims on the day of establishing such security interests. The above rules also apply to
guarantees, suretyships (Polish: poręczenia) and to other similar activities performed to secure performances.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests**

Comments made below are relevant for the Polish Guarantor, being the Polish limited liability company.

**_Governing law and enforceability_**

In the event of subjecting the Polish Guarantor’s Guarantees and Collateral to the laws of Germany in a
dispute before a Polish court, only substantive laws of Germany will be applied (subject to the provisions of
Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law


-----

applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I)) while the laws of procedure will be governed by Polish law.
Furthermore, as a rule, Polish courts can refuse to apply or execute foreign legal provisions, if the application
of such provisions results in the contravention of peremptory rules of Polish public policy, or if specific law
has to be applied regardless of the choice of law (e.g., should any rights in rem be involved, they will be subject
to the laws of the country in which the subject of these rights is located).

As a general rule, the decisions of Polish courts become final and non-appealable after execution of
appropriate remedy path or after the expiry of the statutory term to file a remedy, subject to applicability of
extraordinary legal remedies if available.

The decisions issued by foreign courts, as the general rule, become enforceable in Poland after establishing
their enforceability by the Polish court. The Polish court may refuse to declare the enforceability of the decision
of the foreign court, inter alia, if the decision is in contravention of peremptory rules of Polish public policy.

As a general rule, the decisions of the courts of other EU member states do not need to be declared enforceable
by the Polish courts, prior to their enforcement in Poland. Enforceability of these decisions may be challenged,
however, in a separate proceeding before the Polish court.

As a general rule, decisions of the Polish courts (including on issuance of enforceability clause) and
appropriate actions of enforcement officers with whom the enforcement of claims is sought may be, depending
on the circumstances, required for the enforcement of the given security interest.

**_Insolvency as a result of an excess of obligations over the value of the company’s assets_**

Obligations of the Polish Guarantor under the Notes and the Guarantees and Collateral are subject to
limitations resulting from the application of provisions of the Polish Bankruptcy Law.

As already specified above, in addition to the “liquidity test” limited liability companies may also be deemed
insolvent under the “balance sheet test” if their financial obligations exceed the value of their assets and this
“negative surplus” continues to exist for longer than twenty four consecutive months (except for future
liabilities, including liabilities subject to a suspensory condition, and shareholder loans or other legal act
having the similar effects made within five years prior to declaration of the debtor’s bankruptcy). Nevertheless,
even if the above conditions are met, the court may reject a bankruptcy petition, provided that there is no
threat to the debtor’s ability to perform its due and payable obligations in a short term.

**_Actio Pauliana_**

Polish civil law provides a basis for declaring some actions done to the detriment of creditors ineffective (so
called “actio Pauliana”). In general, if as a result of a legal act performed by a debtor to the detriment of
creditors, a third party gains a financial benefit, each of the creditors may demand that the said act be declared
ineffective with respect to it, if the debtor acted knowingly to the creditors’ detriment, and the third party
knew or, having used due care, could have learned of it. This provision applies accordingly if the debtor acts
with an intention to harm future creditors. It is assumed that the debtor’s legal act is performed to the creditors’
detriment if, as a result of such act, the debtor becomes insolvent or becomes insolvent to a greater degree
than he was before performing the act (as described in Supreme Court judgements Case No. II CSK 548/11,
Case No. III CSK 143/16, Case No. III CSK 214/11). The application to the court with respect to “actio
_Pauliana” can be filed within five years from the date of the act._

Furthermore, the Polish Civil Code stipulates that if a contract is executed whose performance renders the
satisfaction of a third party claim partly or wholly impossible, that party may demand that the contract be
declared ineffective with respect to it if the parties to the contract knew of the claim or if the contract was free
of charge.

**_Limitations resulting from the Polish Commercial Code_**

The Notes and the Guarantees and the grant of Collateral by the Polish Guarantor is also subject to certain
provisions of the Polish Commercial Companies Code (Polish: Kodeks Spółek Handlowych) of September 15,
2000 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2022, item 1467, as amended) (the “Polish Commercial Companies
**Code”). With respect to the limited liability company (Polish: spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, sp. z**
_o.o.) pursuant to the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the creation of a limited right in rem over the_
enterprise or over its organized part requires a resolution of the shareholders under the pain of invalidity.

Pursuant to Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the shareholders may not receive,
under any title, any payments from the Polish limited liability company’s assets needed to fully cover the share


-----

capital of this company. A breach of this rule results in the shareholders’ obligation to return the payments up
to the amount of the share capital. Therefore, the liability of any Guarantor incorporated under Polish law on
account of payments under the up-stream Guarantees should be limited by the Polish capital maintenance
rules i.e., so that it would not result in a payment being made in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish
Commercial Companies Code.

If a share pledge is enforced and the shareholder changes, a new “relation of domination”might arise. In such
case the new shareholder would be obliged to notify the dependent company, i.e., the Polish Guarantor, of
this fact. Otherwise, its right to vote from its shares representing more than 33% of the share capital of the
dependent company will be suspended. A new relation of domination might also arise if under a pledge
agreement, the pledgee gains a majority of the votes at the general meeting of the Polish Guarantor. The
corresponding notification duty has to be fulfilled by the pledgee.

**_Interests limitation_**

Pursuant to Article 359 of the Act of 23 April 1964 Civil Code (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2023,
item 1610 as amended) (the “Civil Code”), the maximum interest resulting from the legal act, i.e., so called
“capital interest” (Polish: odsetki kapitałowe) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest (i.e., double
of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 3.5 percentage points).

In addition, according to the Article 481 of the Civil Code, the maximum interest resulting from a delay
(Polish: odsetki za opóźnienie) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest for delay (i.e., double of the
sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 5.5 percentage points).

Should the value of interest exceed the value of relevant maximum interest, then relevant maximum interest is
due. Contractual provisions cannot exclude or limit the provisions on maximum interest. The abovementioned specific provision of Polish law shall be applied by a Polish court irrespective of the fact that the
parties have chosen foreign law to govern the transaction (overriding mandatory provisions).

**_Clearance from the President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers in order to_**
**_execute some rights over shares_**

An exercise of voting rights in the Polish Guarantor by the holder of the relevant security under a power of
attorney may be recognized as a change of control pursuant to the Act on Protection of Competition and
Consumers of February 16, 2007 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2023, item 1689, as amended) (the
“Competition Law”), if certain statutory conditions regarding the requirement to notify the concentration (in
particular, related to the turnover generated by the parties), indicated in the art. 13 of the Competition Law,
are met. However, art. 14 of the Competition Law provides with exceptions, when the clearance from the
President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers (the “President of UOKiK”), is
not required. Among others, the notification is not required, when an entity acquires or takes up, on a
temporary basis, stocks and shares with a view to securing debts, provided, that such entity does not exercise
the rights arising from these stocks or shares, except for the right to sell.

Thus, the holder of such security may be obliged to notify the President of UOKiK about its intention to
exercise its voting rights and to obtain prior antimonopoly clearance to exercise such voting rights. The
enforcement of a pledge through the appropriation of the shares by the Security Agent may be recognized as
a notifiable merger under the Competition Law. Therefore, the holder of the relevant security interest may be
required to notify the President of UOKIK about the intended concentration and obtain relevant
antimonopoly clearance to take over the shares.

**_Decision of the President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers to take action to_**
**_sell shares or stocks_**

As a result of the amendments to the regulations of May 20, 2023, the aim of which is to extend the liability
for competition-restricting practices, in the event that a given entrepreneur commits unlawful anti-competitive
practices, an entrepreneur exercising decisive influence may also be deemed to be in breach, whereby an
entrepreneur is presumed to exercise decisive influence if its share in the capital of another entrepreneur
exceeds 90%. In such a situation, the President of UOKIK may, in a decision on recognizing a practice as
restrictive of competition, order to undertake actions consisting in the sale of shares or stocks ensuring control
over the entrepreneur or entrepreneurs.

**_Perfection requirements_**

Generally, under Polish law, for a valid and effective establishment of security interests certain perfection
requirements need to be fulfilled, including the requirements specified below.


-----

The registered civil (ordinary) and financial pledges over the shares in the Polish Guarantor may be validly
established only after fulfillment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper
registered pledge agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register of
pledges maintained by the competent court and will become effective vis à vis the Polish Guarantor once it is
notified of the establishment of such pledge; (ii) the proper civil (ordinary) pledge agreement must be executed
with the signatures certified by a Polish notary and will become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once
it is notified of the establishment of such pledge; (iii) the proper financial pledge agreement must be executed
and will become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such pledge,
(iv) the pledges should be disclosed in the book of shares of the Polish Guarantor. Additional formal
requirements are to be complied with.

The registered, civil (ordinary) and financial pledges over the bank accounts the Polish Guarantor may be
validly established only after fulfilment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the
proper registered pledge agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register
of pledges maintained by the competent court; (ii) the proper civil (ordinary) pledge agreement must be
executed with a certified date (i.e. a date certified by a Polish notary); (iii) the proper financial pledge agreement
must be executed; (iv) the bank maintaining the bank account needs to be notified by the pledgor about the
establishment of the civil (ordinary) and financial pledge; and (v) a financial pledge over the funds in a bank
account should be noted in the relevant bank account that is the subject of the security. The agreement of the
security assignment or transfer of ownership of a thing, receivable or of other right (even if governed by
non-Polish law) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate (as defined by the Bankruptcy Law) of the assignor,
if it was executed in writing with a certified date (i.e., a date certified by a Polish notary).

In principle, a secured creditor can enforce its security once the secured claim becomes mature, in whole or in
part (that is, the debt becomes due and payable). Under certain circumstances, the creditor must obtain a final
and non-appealable court decision and enforcement clause before enforcing its security. A less formal
procedure is possible, for example, if the claim is secured by registered or financial pledge and the pledge
agreement provides that the creditor can take over the pledge object.

**_Parallel debt structure under Polish law_**

In majority of cases, under Polish law security interests cannot be granted to a party other than the creditor of
the secured claim. Generally, under Polish law, the pledge or mortgage is strictly accessory and follows the
debt or claim it secures and may not be transferred without such debt or claim. If such debt or claim is
transferred without the pledge or mortgage, the pledge or mortgage will expire.

For that reason, in certain transactions, also in Poland, a parallel debt structure is used, whereby the guarantor,
as a separate and independent obligation governed by non-Polish law, undertakes to pay to the security agent
amounts equal to the amounts due by it to all creditors in a given transaction. Such parallel debt structure,
therefore, creates a single separate and independent claim of the security agent that can be validly secured by
a security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the security agent in its own capacity as
a creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and not as a representative of the creditors. It
is usually expressly agreed in such parallel debt agreement that the obligations of the debtor towards the
security agent shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are
reduced (and vice versa).

The Supreme Court issued the judgments on October 9, 2009 (Case No. IV CSK 145/09, Case No. IV CSK
169/09 and Case No. IV CSK 155/09) concerning the effectiveness of establishing security interests over the
assets of the debtor of parallel debt. In the above cases, the Supreme Court has not challenged the validity of
a foreign law parallel debt structure, however, such structure was only indirectly referred to in the above
judgments. As there is no doctrine of “precedence” under Polish law, uncertainty exists as to validity and
enforceability of the parallel debt under Polish law.

As Polish law does not recognize the concept of “trust” or “trustee”, it is uncertain how the Security Agent
will be treated by a Polish court.

**UNITED KINGDOM**

Wepa UK Ltd (the “English Guarantor”) is incorporated in England and Wales and its registered office is also
located in England and Wales. Therefore any insolvency proceedings in respect of the English Guarantor are
likely to be commenced in England and Wales and conducted in accordance with the requirements of English
insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. The scope of the English
courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency (and restructuring) proceedings available in England


-----

and Wales, further detail is set out below. To the extent that the English Guarantor has any assets and/or
creditors in any overseas jurisdictions and enters into insolvency proceedings in England, recognition of those
proceedings in such other jurisdictions is likely to be a relevant consideration. Such recognition would be a
matter for the private international law of the relevant jurisdictions.

Insolvency proceedings in relation to the English Guarantor could also be opened in a country other than
England and Wales in circumstances dictated by the domestic local rules of the jurisdiction in which those
insolvency proceedings were to be commenced. By way of example, where a debtor has its “center of main
interests”(as defined in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings) in a member state of the EU (other than Denmark), then (and subject to
certain exceptions), insolvency proceedings in relation to that debtor could be opened in the relevant EU
member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state.

If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales, such proceedings could
be in parallel to proceedings opened in England. Such foreign proceedings may be recognized in England,
albeit such recognition would not be automatic. For instance, there may be recognition in England pursuant
to the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (the “CBIR”), which implement the UNCITRAL Model
Law on Cross Border Insolvency in England and Wales. The CBIR provide that foreign insolvency proceedings
may be recognized in England where a company has its center of main interest (as that concept is used in the
CBIR) or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic
activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Such recognition under the
CBIR would be accompanied (depending upon the circumstances) by an automatic stay and a suspension of
the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company (neither of which will affect
a creditor’s right to enforce security interests over the Collateral (albeit such a stay may be requested from the
English court) or to set off its claim against a claim of the company, provided that such right would have been
exercisable if the company had been made the subject of a winding-up order under the UK Insolvency Act
(defined below)). Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, where necessary to protect the assets of the
company or the interests of creditors the court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any
appropriate relief. This may include, without limitation, staying the commencement or continuation of
individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities,
staying execution against the company’s assets, suspending the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose
of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of evidence or the
delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities entrusting
the administration or realization of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign
representative or another person designated by the court, extending relief of a provisional nature previously
granted and the granting of any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder
under the laws of Great Britain, including any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the UK
Insolvency Act (defined below).

It is therefore not possible to say with certainty where insolvency proceedings will be brought.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors
may be familiar. In the event that the English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are
guaranteed by the English Guarantor and secured by security interests over the Collateral created by, among
others, the English Guarantor. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of
a Guarantee against the English Guarantor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations
on the Guarantee and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely
affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantee and/or the Collateral securing the
Notes and the Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of
the English Guarantor.

**_The Insolvency Test_**

The Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “UK Insolvency Act”) has no test for or definition of insolvency
per se but instead relies on the concept of a company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of
its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act, a company will be deemed “unable to pay
its debts” if it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the company is not able to pay its debts as they fall due
(“cashflow” basis) or that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking
into account its contingent and prospective liabilities) (“balance sheet”basis). Such insolvency is presumed if,


-----

among other matters, a statutory demand for over £750 is served on the company and remains unsatisfied for
three weeks or the company has failed to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the
relevant creditor within such period, or if any execution or other process issued in respect of a court judgment
in favor of a creditor is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England may be initiated in a number of ways and by
different parties depending on the process (see below for further detail on each process).

**_Applicable insolvency proceedings_**

For these purposes, the applicable insolvency regimes under English law are administration and liquidation.

The English legal regime (which is principally set out in the UK Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England
and Wales) Rules 2016 (together with the UK Insolvency Act, (the “UK Insolvency Legislation”)) that would
apply in the event of any insolvency proceedings of the English Guarantor may not be as favorable to creditors
as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions with which creditors may be more familiar.

**_Administration_**

Administration is a flexible procedure, the primary purpose of which is the rescue of the company as a going
concern (the other purposes are set out below). A company can enter into administration if the company is
(i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 (“CA06”) in England and Wales or Scotland, (ii) is incorporated
in an EEA State; (iii) is not incorporated in an EEA State but has its center of main interests (as defined in the
UK Act) (“COMI”) in an EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the UK; (iv) has its center of main
interests (as defined in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (as it applies under English law) (“Retained European Insolvency
**Regulation”) (“Retained EIR COMI”) in an EU Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an**
establishment in the UK; or (v) it has its Retained EIR COMI in the UK. Without limitation and subject to
specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company
is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to
achieve the purpose of administration.

Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), the English Guarantor can be placed into
administration at the application of, among others, the English Guarantor itself, a majority of its directors or
one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors) and, where applicable, the
Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential Regulation authority or certain other designated persons. A
holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the English Guarantor also has the right to appoint
an administrator. In addition, he has the right to intervene in an application made for administration
proceedings by another person by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific
circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver.

Among others, the company or a creditor may apply to court for the making of an administration order in
respect of the company. The out-of-court method of appointment is available only to the directors, the
company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge. No physical court hearing is required and the
administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need to consent to act as
administrator and to state that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be satisfied:
(i) the rescue of the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the
primary objective); (ii) the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be
likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) (the second objective); or (iii) the
realization of some or all of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or
preferential creditors (the third objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the statutory objective
of the administration process in the order set out above. Unless he thinks either that it is not reasonably
practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for
the company’s creditors as a whole, he must try to achieve the primary objective. Moreover, the administrator
cannot pursue the third objective unless he thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the
first objective or the second objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of
the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Subject to this, the administrator must perform his or
her functions in the interests of the company’s creditors as a whole. In order to make an order, the court must
be satisfied that it is reasonably likely that the administration will achieve one or more of these purposes.

If the English Guarantor grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver (subject to the caveat below) or an


-----

administrator out of court. The party may also in that instance receive advance notice of an intention of the
company to appoint an administrator or become aware that the company has filed for liquidation so that the
lender can then appoint its own administrator or administrative receiver.

A qualifying floating charge is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the UK Insolvency Act as being a
floating charge created by an instrument which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or
(ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver and/or an
administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a qualifying floating charge if that person holds one
or more debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security which together relate to
the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying
floating charge.

Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or
cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of
the property’ is covered and thereby whether the charge is a “qualifying floating charge” and the lender is able
to appoint an administrator out-of-court. There is further, the risk of re-characterization referred to below,
which can occur in a variety of circumstances, including in less obvious cases, for example, where the granting
of security is subject to contractual consents, or where covenant lite style disposal covenants may not restrict
transfers of shares in subsidiaries.

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order
(in the case of court appointment) is made or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court
and, when an administrator is appointed, a full statutory moratorium applies. Whilst there are a few
exceptions, save where the court or (in the case of a full statutory moratorium) the administrator consents,
that moratorium prevents creditors taking any action against the company to recover their debts including,
among other things, commencing or continuing any legal process against the company, winding up the
company, enforcing security or repossessing goods in the company’s possession under a hire purchase or
similar agreement. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their
security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the
disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a
charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments
and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the
“Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations”).

Subject to the above points, were the English Guarantor to enter administration, it is possible that the security
granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. Similarly, whilst any principal debt or guarantee
obligation owed by it would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action could be taken in
respect of any failure to pay.

Upon appointment, an administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes
custody or control of all property to which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. He or she has
broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed
charge security (where powers are more restrictive). Administrators may dispose of property that is subject to
a floating charge without the consent of the relevant charge holder, which will have the same priority in
respect of the proceeds from the disposal as it had in respect of the property disposed of. With the prior
approval of the court, an administrator can dispose of property subject to a fixed charge without the consent
of the relevant secured creditor, provided that: the disposal is likely to promote the administration’s purpose;
and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question (plus any
additional amount required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the
court as the net amount which would be realized on a sale of property at market value) towards discharging
the obligations of the company to the secured creditor.

An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and an administrator does not have the power to
disclaim contracts (although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the best
interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt.

Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms providing
for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon the occurrence of an insolvency
event (including administration) will generally be suspended for the duration of the relevant insolvency
procedure (see below).

**_Administrative Receivership_**

With respect to the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless
the security document pre dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the UK Insolvency


-----

Act as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers.
In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which
(a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver
within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the UK Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying
floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to
the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English company and at least one such
security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the
appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as
defined in the UK Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least
£50 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the
issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the UK Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated,
listed or traded debt instrument, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). More
information in relation to the requirements for the capital market arrangements exception are set out below.

Pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A to the UK Insolvency Act, an arrangement is a capital market
arrangement if: (i) it involves a grant of security to (A) a person holding it as trustee for a person who holds
a capital market investment issued by a party to the arrangement; or (B) a party to the arrangement who
issues a capital market investment; or (C) a person who holds the security as trustee for a party to the
arrangement in connection with the issue of a capital market investment; or (D) a person who holds the
security as trustee for a party to the arrangement who agrees to provide finance to another party; or (ii) at
least one party guarantees the performance of obligations of another party; or (iii) at least one party provides
security in respect of the performance of the obligations of another party; or (iv) it involves an investment of
a kind described in articles 83 to 85 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities)
Order 2001 (SI 2001/544), which relates to options, futures and contracts for differences (the “Regulated
**Activities Order”).**

Paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2A to the UK Insolvency Act states that a party to an arrangement includes a
party to an agreement which forms part of the arrangement, provides for the raising of finance as part of the
arrangement, or is necessary for the purposes of implementing the arrangement. We note that there is no
statutory definition or case law on the meaning of the term “arrangement”, however it is clear that an
arrangement can be more than just one agreement and in our view the term is apposite to describe a series of
inter-related transactions.

Pursuant to paragraph 5 of Schedule 2A to the UK Insolvency Act, the requirement to incur debt of at least
£50 million may be incurred at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement and may be
expressed wholly or partly in foreign currency (in which case the sterling equivalent shall be calculated as at
the time when the arrangement is entered into).

Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the UK Insolvency Act, an investment is a capital market
investment if it: (i) is within article 77 or 77A of the Regulated Activities Order; and (ii) is rated, listed or
traded or designed to be rated, listed or traded.

To place a company into administrative receivership, the holder of a qualifying floating charge must execute
a document appointing an administrative receiver in accordance with the terms of the security document
pursuant to which the qualifying floating charge was created. This appointment document must then be
delivered to the proposed administrative receiver and the appointment takes effect upon receipt (provided that
the administrative receiver formally accepts the appointment by the end of the next business day). There is no
statutory moratorium that takes effect in relation to or as a result of the appointment of an administrative
receiver.

The principal duty of an administrative receiver is to realise the assets of the company in order to repay the
principal and interest secured by the document pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed
(the “Secured Debt”). An administrative receiver generally has broad powers to deal with the company and its
assets which derive from both the security document pursuant to which he or she was appointed and
Schedule 1 of the UK Insolvency Act (except insofar as this is inconsistent with the terms of that security
document). In exercising such powers, an administrative receiver acts as agent of the company, unless and
until it goes into liquidation. However, an administrative receiver can only dispose of assets which are subject
to prior ranking security with the permission of the court if the court is satisfied that the disposal (with or
without other property) would be likely to promote a more advantageous realization of the company’s
property than would otherwise be effected and on the condition that the proceeds of sale and any difference
between those and the open market value are used to discharge that security. Further, unlike an administrator,


-----

an administrative receiver’s powers do not extend to bringing actions against the directors or former directors
or (except in very limited circumstances) seeking to set aside certain transactions. Assets coming into the
hands of the administrative receiver are applied in payment of Secured Debt, less any costs of realization, the
preferential debts and the Prescribed Part (defined below).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure)
and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the
security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction
at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any
administrative receiver will vacate office.

**_Liquidation / Winding-up_**

Liquidation proceedings may be opened where: (i) the company is registered in England and Wales or
Scotland; (ii) the debtor’s Retained EIR COMI is in the UK, or (iii) the debtor’s Retained EIR COMI is in an
EU member state (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK. The English courts can also
open compulsory liquidation (see below) in respect of foreign companies as unregistered companies if such
foreign company has a sufficient connection to England and Wales.

Liquidation is a procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and distributed by the liquidator
to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the UK Insolvency Legislation. At the end of the
liquidation process, the company will normally be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.
Liquidation proceedings can be opened by a creditor filing a petition with a court to wind up the company (a
“compulsory winding up”) or the company resolving to do so in a general meeting of shareholders (a
“voluntary winding up”), which in turn can be divided into members’ voluntary liquidation and creditors’
voluntary liquidation. The key difference between the two latter proceedings is in a members’ voluntary
liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the
following 12 months prior to the members resolving to place the company into liquidation. The process is
controlled by the shareholders. In a creditors’ voluntary liquidation, the company may be solvent or insolvent
and, while initiated by the shareholders, involves some degree of control by the creditors.

The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its
debts (as defined in Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act). A company is unable to pay its debts if it is
insolvent either on a “cash flow” or “balance sheet” basis. In broad terms, a company is cash flow insolvent if
it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; a company is balance sheet insolvent if the value of its assets is less
than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up.
In a compulsory winding up, under Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant
company’s property, any transfer of the company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members
made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Subject to certain
exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have
commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a winding up order is made by
the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be
continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on
the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the
retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to
wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act. There is also no
automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory
of the company, to apply to court for a stay. Ordinary practice is to grant the stay on proceedings brought by
a creditor in respect of a debt that is largely admitted and should be determined in the liquidation rather than
through separate legal proceedings. As with a compulsory liquidation, this is important because it means
secured creditors, for example, can go ahead and enforce their security.

Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its
creditors as a whole and has wide powers to do whatever is necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. A
liquidator has the power to agree, compromise and pay creditor claims, bring or defend legal proceedings on
behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial
winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to
challenge antecedent transactions. While a liquidation does not in itself terminate financial or commercial
contracts, a liquidator does have the power to disclaim onerous contracts and he or she can choose to breach


-----

a contract if he or she considers it to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the
resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt.

Following the enactment of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, contractual terms in supplier
contracts providing for automatic termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon the
occurrence of an insolvency event (including liquidation) will generally be suspended for the duration of the
relevant insolvency procedure (see below).

For the Holders of the Notes, indirectly benefiting from the Guarantee and security interests granted by the
English Guarantor, the most important consequences of the opening of formal insolvency proceedings in
England and Wales against the English Guarantor would be that:

   - the appointed insolvency practitioner (an administrator or liquidator) would have the right to
administer and dispose of the assets of such English Guarantor as the representative of the insolvent
estate;

   - in certain circumstances, an administrator or a liquidator will have powers to challenge the
Guarantee and security interests granted by the English Guarantor and potentially certain
intercompany obligations entered into by the English Guarantor; and

   - in general terms, the Holders of the Notes could only pursue their claims against the English
Guarantor in accordance with the provisions in the UK Insolvency Legislation.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the
terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge
(such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an
appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An
administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was
appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per
Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations.

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which he or she is appointed, meaning
he or she owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator,
who performs his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership
is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the
receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so,
the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the
realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity
from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted
from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the prescribed part and any preferential
creditors.

**_Priority of claims in UK insolvency proceedings_**

In the liquidation of the English Guarantor or its administration (where the relevant administrator makes a
distribution), the insolvent company’s assets will be realized and distributed to its creditors. Creditors are
placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the
realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in a descending order of priority, as set out below.
With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions cannot be made to a class of
creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been repaid in full. Unless creditors
have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the cash is distributed in proportion
to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Whereas the principle of pari passu distribution would dis-allow contractual setting-off arrangements entered
into after a company enters liquidation or an administrator issues notice of his/her intention to make a
distribution of assets to creditors, it does not prevent the effect of mandatory insolvency set-off, which sees an
account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and
whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation of the


-----

company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if
amounts remain due to the company).

The statutory order of priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

   - First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in
specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the company but
only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the value of the
asset in which they have a proprietary interest;

   - Second ranking claims: any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver and moratorium
debts and certain “priority pre moratorium debts” in circumstances where a company has entered
into a standalone moratorium and subsequently entered into administration or liquidation within
12 weeks beginning with the day after the end of the moratorium;

   - Third ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency
proceedings (there is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which those
expenses are paid);

   - Fourth ranking claims: ordinary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), which
include (but are not limited to) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes,
employment claims (wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the
insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person and holiday pay due to any employee whose
contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency
date) and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit;

   - Fifth ranking claims: secondary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), including
bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the
claims exceed the statutory limit, deposits made through a non-UK branch of a credit institution
that would otherwise have been eligible for FSCS compensation and claims by HMRC in respect of
certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI
contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and
employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers;

   - Sixth ranking claims: subject to certain exceptions, the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount
of money that the administrator or liquidator must set aside from realizations from floating charge
assets for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors
and expenses out of floating charge realizations, and unless the cost of making the prescribed part
available to unsecured creditors would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors) (the
“Prescribed Part”). calculated as 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of net realizations and 20 per cent.
of the net realizations thereafter, up to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the
company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge
created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000);

   - Seventh ranking claims: holders of floating charge security to the extent of the realizations from
those secured assets according to the priority of their security. However, before distributing such
asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part must, subject to certain
exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

   - Eighth ranking claims: general

      - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and secured creditors to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination
agreements in place between any of them) in each case including accrued and unpaid interest
on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay
the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use
realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from
the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all
unsecured creditors;

      - secondly, statutory interest that arises on debts after the commencement of liquidation or after
the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing
administration at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in
accordance with the Judgments Act 1838; and


-----

      - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are
fully paid; and

   - Ninth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company,
provided that it is in the process of being wound up. There are no equitable subordination provisions
under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks as a provable debt alongside
other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

The UK Insolvency Legislation broadly provides that in a liquidation of a company, where the assets available
for payment of its general creditors (excluding any amount ring fenced for unsecured debts as described
above) are not sufficient to meet the liquidation expenses, certain specified liquidation expenses can be claimed
out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of
preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims.

In the case of litigation expenses exceeding £5,000, this is subject to rules restricting the application of this
provision to certain litigation expenses approved by the floating chargee and any preferential creditors or the
court. Consequently, realizations by secured creditors upon the enforcement of floating charges securing any
principal or guarantee obligation to the Holders could potentially be reduced by the amount of any liquidation
expenses. If any fixed security is validly created, any claims of creditors holding such fixed security would
rank ahead of any such liquidation expenses. The creditors holding the security would, however, pay the
expenses of realizing their security directly to the liquidator or other person (such as a receiver or security
trustee) who disposed of the secured assets on their behalf.

Broadly speaking, expenses that qualify as expenses of the administration (and which include, among others,
expenses properly incurred by the administrator in performing his functions in the administration and
necessary disbursements incurred in the course of the administration) enjoy priority status, in a similar way to
liquidation expenses (as described above) although the categories of expenses are slightly different. In
particular, expenses of the administration can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to
a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims.

**_Fixed and Floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating
charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed
charge was granted); (b) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s or administrator’s remuneration
and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly
incurred in a winding up or administration are payable out of the charging company’s assets (including the
assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a
charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and
expenses in priority to floating charge claims; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to
property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the
floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets
subject to the floating charge; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal
with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such
assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets
free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority
to the floating charge security; (e) in comparison to fixed charge security, floating charge security is subject to
certain additional challenges under English insolvency law; and (f) where the floating charge is not created or
otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial
instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the
Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations, floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain
preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees)
and to ring-fencing of the “prescribed part” for unsecured creditors. This summary does not set out an
exhaustive statement of consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating security interests.

**_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to


-----

them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as
fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the
secured party has the requisite degree of control over the English Guarantor’s ability to deal in the relevant
assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the holder of the security in
practice. Where the English Guarantor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed
charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the
security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed
charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to
attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed
security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion
and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security
interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the English Guarantor in respect of that part of the
English Guarantor’s net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing under “—Priority
_of Claims in UK Insolvency Proceedings” above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of_
the English Guarantor may have priority over the rights of the Security Agent to the proceeds of enforcement
of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also
rank ahead of the claims of the Security Agent as floating charge holder.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Collateral_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of a
guarantee or security interest can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or
liquidator is appointed to the company within a specified period (as set forth in more detail below) of the
granting of the guarantee or security interest and, in certain circumstances, if the company was “unable to
pay its debts” when the guarantee or security interest was granted or became “unable to pay its debts” as a
result of granting the guarantee or security interest. If the Guarantee or any security interest granted by the
English Guarantor is successfully challenged under the laws of England and Wales, and the court makes
certain findings (as described further below), the court may:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of the English Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantee or
security interests provided by it;

   - direct that the Holders of the Notes return any amounts paid to them by the English Guarantor
under the Guarantee, either directly to the English Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the
English Guarantor’s creditors generally; and/or

   - take other action that may be detrimental to the Holders of the Notes.

The English Guarantor cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency
(as described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee
in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

_Onset of insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is made; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or
(c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation,
the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary
liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows
administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration.

_Connected persons_

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge (as described below) has been
entered into by the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and
presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person”of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions
at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a
shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant
company.


-----

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband,
wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (d) the husband, wife or
civil partner of a relative of the individual. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that
company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies,
or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates,
have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups
either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one
or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions,
or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general
meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together
satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The following potential grounds of challenge may apply to the Guarantee and/or security interests given by
the English Guarantor under the UK Insolvency Act:

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a guarantee granted or collateral provided by a company (or give other relief) on the grounds
that the creation of such guarantee or provision of collateral constituted a transaction at an undervalue. We
note that section 118 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (the “SBEEA”) introduced
section 246ZD to the UK Insolvency Act from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and
administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any
transaction under section 238 of the UK Insolvency Act. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted
recognition under the CBIR, he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a transaction at an undervalue.

The grant of a guarantee or provision of collateral will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company
either receives no consideration in return for the guarantee or provision of collateral, or receives consideration
of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by it. It is doubtful that a
granting of security would constitute a transaction at an undervalue. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee
must be granted or the collateral must be provided within a period of two years ending with the onset of the
company’s insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act).

In addition the company must either be “unable to pay its debts” when it grants the guarantee or provides the
collateral or become “unable to pay its debts”as a result. Even if these tests are satisfied, a court will not make
an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the
transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there
were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court
determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, it will make such order as it thinks fit to
restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could
include reducing payments under the relevant guarantee or setting it or the provision of the collateral aside).
In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company
was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction is a “connected person” of the English
company (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption that the company was
unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was
in fact solvent.

**_Preference_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a guarantee or security interest granted by such company (or give other relief) on the grounds
that such guarantee or security interest constituted a preference. We note that section 118 of the SBEA
introduced section 246ZD to the UK Insolvency Act from 1 October 2015 and provides that liquidators and
administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any
preference claim under section 239 of the UK Insolvency Act. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted
recognition under the CBIR he or she also has standing to bring a preference claim.

The grant of a guarantee or security interest will be a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a
surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation
than if the guarantee or security interest had not been granted. The company must either have been unable to


-----

pay its debts at the time of the transaction or become so unable as a result of the transaction. A challenge can
only be made if the guarantee or security interest was granted within the period of (i) six months ending with
the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act—see above) if the beneficiary of
the guarantee or security interest is not a connected person or (ii) if the beneficiary is a connected person of
the English company, two years ending with the onset of insolvency. A court should not make an order that a
preference has been granted unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to enter into the
relevant transaction by a desire to put the relevant creditor in a better position in the event of the company’s
liquidation. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other
commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position. Moreover, a
company can only grant a preference to an existing creditor, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company’s
debts or other liabilities. If the Holders of the Notes only become creditors of the English Guarantor at the
same time as they subscribe for the Notes and become creditors of the Issuer and it is a condition of their
subscribing for the Notes that such guarantees or security interest are granted, it is very unlikely that any
question of preference should arise. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a
preference, it will make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that
preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting them
or any security interests aside). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate
that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced
by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person,
in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was in fact no such influence.

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company, or a person who is a victim of
the relevant transaction (with leave of the court if the company is in liquidation and a moratorium on creditor
action is in place with respect to that company, or if the company is in administration), could apply to the
court for an order to set aside a guarantee or collateral on the grounds that the guarantee or provision of
collateral was a transaction defrauding creditors. A claim can also be made by, subject to certain conditions,
the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. A
foreign officeholder recognized under the CBIR also has standing to apply to court.

A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it satisfies the criteria for being a transaction
at an undervalue (see above) and the court is satisfied that the substantial purpose of the company in entering
into the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against the company
or to prejudice the interests of such persons in relation to their actual or potential claim.

There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the company must enter insolvency
proceedings for this ground of challenge to be available (although general statutory limitation periods will
apply) and the relevant company does not need to be unable to pay its debts at the time or as a result of the
relevant transaction for a challenge under this head of claim to be made out. The fact that the transaction was
not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective
purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show
that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

If the court determines the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, it may make such order as it
sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to
protect the interests of the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or
setting it or the collateral aside). Such an order may not prejudice any interest in property that was acquired
from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances or require a third
party who received a benefit from the relevant transaction that acted in good faith, for value and without
notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum, unless he was a party to the relevant transaction.

**_Extortionate credit transactions_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company (or a foreign officeholder
recognized under the CBIR) could apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. We note that
section 118 of the SBEA introduced section 246ZD to the UK Insolvency Act from 1 October 2015 and
provides that liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the
cause of action) in respect of any extortionate credit transaction claim under section 244 of the UK Insolvency
Act.


-----

The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by the English Guarantor up to three years
before the day on which the English Guarantor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A
transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the
terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally
or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened
ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**_Floating charges capable of being set aside_**

The UK Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by an English
company during the “relevant time” will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to;
(b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of (and the amount of such
interest payable in respect of the money paid, services supplied, or discharge or reduction of debt), the relevant
English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (the “Consideration”). This
means that a floating charge can be partly invalid to the extent that it is provided for past consideration.

In the case of a floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not connected to the English
Guarantor, the relevant time is deemed to be the period of 12 months ending with the onset of the English
Guarantor’s insolvency provided that at the time the charge was granted the English Guarantor was unable to
pay its debts or became unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating
charge was granted. If the floating charge is created in favor of a person connected to the English Guarantor,
the relevant look back time is a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency and there is no
requirement that at the time the charge was granted the English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts or
became unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was
granted.

Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantor becomes unable to pay its debts within a period of up to
two years of the issuance of the Notes, any floating charge created during the relevant time period will be
automatically invalid, except to the value of the Consideration. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable)
will not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law save
for where there is a foreign officeholder recognized under the CBIR who wishes to attack the floating charge
under article 23 of the CBIR.

However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements Regulations, the floating charge will not be void as described in this paragraph.

**_Dispositions after Winding Up_**

Any disposition of the English company’s property which is made after the compulsory winding up of the
company has commenced is void, unless the court orders otherwise. The compulsory winding up of a company
is deemed to start when a winding up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than the
date on which the court makes the winding up order (if any).

**_Secondary Legislation_**

UK secondary legislation, such as the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations, may be invalid and
ineffective if, among other things, it is not enacted within the scope of the relevant primary statute or within
the powers of the relevant rule-making authorities.

**_Corporate authorizations and maintenance of capital_**

The legality, validity and enforceability of the obligations of the English Guarantor under the Guarantee and
the Collateral are subject to matters affecting companies generally, including that: (i) its entry into and
performance of such obligations: (A) are not prohibited by its constitutional documents (or contracts to
which it is party); and (B) have been duly authorized and do not breach or result in inconsistency with
applicable laws or regulations; and (ii) the documents evidencing such obligations have been duly executed
and delivered in accordance with all applicable procedures and laws. In addition, the granting of guarantees
or security by an English company could be subject to challenge if it results in a reduction in that company’s
net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the extent that it does, the company does not have sufficient
distributable reserves to cover that reduction.

**_Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security and guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding
the legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities
(including guarantees and security).


-----

**_Wrongful trading_**

If, in the course of an insolvent winding up or insolvent administration of a company, it appears that a person
who is, or was, a director of the company knew or ought to have concluded at some point before the
commencement of the liquidation or administration that there was no reasonable prospect that the company
would avoid going into insolvent liquidation or insolvent administration, the liquidator or administrator of
the company can seek a court declaration that the director make a contribution to the company’s assets
pursuant to the UK Insolvency Act.

**_Assignments_**

Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a legal
assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that provision,
which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing and signed by the assignor; (ii) the assignment must be
absolute and not purporting to be by way of charge only; (iii) notice of the assignment must be given in
writing to the underlying obligor or counterparty; and (iv) the rights to be assigned must be wholly
ascertainable and must not relate to only part of a debt or other chose in action. If any of these requirements
is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment. Equitable assignments,
including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including, without limitation: (i) where an
equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will take priority if the holder
acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable
interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the
person in control of that equitable interest. The first person to give notice will take priority if that person does
not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest and has given consideration for his or her interest.

**_“People with significant control” regime_**

Pursuant to Part 21A of the CA06 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the CA06), from 6 April 2016 certain
UK incorporated companies, societates europaeae registered in the UK and limited liability partnerships
formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a
“Relevant Company”) must keep a register of certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have
significant control over them. Failure of such registrable individuals or legal entities or other persons specified
in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the CA 2006 (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a “Notifying
**Party”) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give relevant companies the right to issue a**
restrictions notice to such Notifying Party for the purposes of Schedule 1B to the CA 2006. Subject to certain
exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the Relevant Company
(as defined in Schedule 1B to the CA 2006, for example, a share in the Relevant Company): (i) any transfer of
(or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (iii) no
shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and
(iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the Relevant Company in respect of
the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of
the Collateral and the ability of the relevant secured parties to enforce their rights under or in respect of the
Collateral.

**_Equitable share charge_**

The fixed charges over shares in companies incorporated in England and Wales granted by a Guarantor are
equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor transfers the beneficial interest
in the shares to the chargee but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may
be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

**_Application of proceeds_**

The enforceability of a provision in a security document that relates to the application of proceeds will be
subject to any obligations mandatorily preferred by applicable law.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, any
debt of a company payable in a currency other than British pounds (such as euros in the case of the Notes)
must be converted into British pounds at a single rate for each currency determined by the officeholder by
reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the date that the company went into administration or


-----

liquidation. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be
unreasonable, they may apply to the court to determine the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the
Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the English Guarantor goes into
liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become
entitled (by way of distribution in the liquidation or administration).

**_Post-petition interest_**

Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Guarantee to which the English
Guarantor is a party (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any
period after the commencement of administration or liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable from
any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts proved in the English Guarantor’s insolvency
proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of the commencement of those proceedings
provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out
of such security recoveries.

**_Trust Assets_**

Assets held on trust by the company for a third party generally fall outside the insolvent estate that is available
for distribution.

**_Ranking_**

The description given by the parties to the ranking of security interests is not determinative of the ranking of
those security interests.

**_Foreign laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or
other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to
that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English law,
the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

**_Third party rights_**

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance
policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties.

**_Amendments_**

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee
or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship
relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

**_Fetters on exercise of powers_**

A provision under which a company or other legal person agrees, or purports to agree, to fetter the exercise of
its powers under its constitutional documents or any applicable law (or regulation) may not be enforceable
against the company or other legal person.

**_Account banks’ right to set off_**

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an “Account Charge”) granted by the English Guarantor
over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account
**Bank”) may hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event under the**
Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling
or other arrangements with that English Guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those
accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will
be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set off with respect to the bank
accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted
into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to
the relevant English Guarantor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral


-----

will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set off rights (unless the Account Bank
has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances, albeit the Account Bank is unable to contract out
of insolvency set-off whereby mandatory rules of insolvency set-off apply as soon as the English Guarantor
were to enter administration or liquidation), since the Account Bank will only be entitled to exercise its netting
and set off rights until such time as it is informed that the beneficial interest in the debt represented by the
account credit balance has been transferred to a third party.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Notes Guarantees and Collateral_**

Independent of provisions of UK insolvency law, the grant of the Guarantee and provision of the Collateral
by the English Guarantor in respect of the obligations of another Group company must satisfy certain legal
requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the English Guarantor’s memorandum
and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the
grant of the Guarantee or provision of the Collateral can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s
rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the company in
good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate
benefit must be established for the company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.
Section 172 of the CA06 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be
most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors
enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient corporate benefit for the company in question, they
may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside
by a court. Section 172(3) of the CA06 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need
to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not
prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, a majority decision of the Supreme Court has held that the
shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is insolvent or is
bordering on insolvency or that an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an obligor incorporated in England and Wales may also be subject to
potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English
company law.

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions (including the application of the Financial
Collateral Arrangements Regulations), any security granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales
(including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the
relevant security) should be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the
date of creation of the relevant security interest in accordance with Chapter A1 of Part 25 of the CA06. While
the CA06 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after
April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the
applicable chargor if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which
was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited
circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and
allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired.

Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does not
need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Registration with applicable asset registries may,
however, still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice
of a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities. In some cases, such as the registration regime
under the CA06, the priority of security interests which are registrable and have been duly registered follows
the chronological order of creation (subject to certain exceptions—see, for example, and without limitation,
the exceptions under “Assignments”above). In other cases, priority in respect of security interests over certain
types of assets depends on the time at which those security interests are registered in a particular asset register.
Thus, for instance, the priority of security interests over ships and aircraft are governed by their respective
dates of registration in the appropriate register, whether or not the relevant secured party had notice of an
earlier unregistered security interest over the relevant asset. Similar rules apply in relation to security interests
over registered land and certain intellectual property rights, such as patents.

**_Restructuring procedures_**

As well as formal insolvency proceedings, there are various restructuring tools under the laws of England and
Wales which the English Guarantor may be subject to and which may adversely affect investors and their


-----

ability to enforce their rights relating to the Notes or the Guarantees. Some of these processes are under the
CA06 (e.g. a scheme of arrangement and a restructuring plan) and some under the UK Insolvency Act (e.g. a
company voluntary arrangement). Further details on these processes are set out below.

**_Schemes of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the CA06, the English courts have jurisdiction
to sanction a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors (or classes of creditors) where
such company is liable to be wound up under the UK Insolvency Act. In order for a scheme of arrangement
proposed by a non UK company to be sanctioned by the English courts, the relevant company must also have
a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

In previous cases, a sufficient connection has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where, among
other things: the relevant company has assets situated in England or carries on business there; its COMI is in
England; and/or it owes liabilities to creditors based in England or under agreements governed by English law.
Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not
necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote at a creditors’
meeting on the proposed compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on
the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors
are to be granted under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. The
scheme will be passed at the creditors’ meeting if a majority in number representing 75% or more in value of
those creditors present and voting at the creditors’ meeting of each class vote in favor of the proposed scheme,
irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, and that scheme will
(subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors
who did not participate in the vote on the scheme and those who voted against the scheme. In certain
circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure the
effectiveness of the compromise. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing
where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the
discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications
being made to the scheme or reject the scheme.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Pursuant to Part 26A of the CA06, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or
arrangement (a “Restructuring Plan”) proposed between a company and its creditors and/or members (or any
class of its creditors and/or members) in circumstances where the company has encountered, or is likely to
encounter, financial difficulties that affect, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going
concern. The purpose of the Restructuring Plan must be to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect
of these financial difficulties. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, the Restructuring Plan procedure is open
to any company liable to be wound up under the UK Insolvency Act (i.e. a foreign company may use the
procedure provided that certain conditions are met).

For a consensual plan (i.e. one where each class votes in favor) to be capable of being sanctioned by the court,
the Restructuring Plan must be approved by 75% by value of creditors or members in each class present in
person or by proxy and voting at each meeting convened to consider the Restructuring Plan (there is no
majority by number test unlike with a scheme of arrangement). The applicant may also apply to the court to
exclude a class from voting if they have no genuine economic interest in the company. Unlike a scheme, if the
Restructuring Plan is not approved by a number representing at least 75% in value of any class of creditors or
members of the company present in person or by proxy and voting at the relevant plan meeting (the
“Dissenting Class”), the Dissenting Class may be crammed down provided that: (i) the court is satisfied that
no members of the Dissenting Class would be any worse off under the Restructuring Plan than they would be
in the most likely alternative scenario (in the court’s view) if the Restructuring Plan is not sanctioned (the
‘relevant alternative’); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan is agreed by 75% by value of a class of creditors or (as
the case may be) members present in person or by proxy and voting at the relevant plan meeting who would
receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the relevant alternative.
Even if the voting threshold is met, the court has discretion as to whether to sanction the Restructuring Plan
and will refuse to sanction if it is not ‘just and equitable’ to do so. If the Restructuring Plan is sanctioned, it
will be binding on all affected parties, including those who did not participate in the vote on the Restructuring
Plan and those who voted against the Restructuring Plan.


-----

**_Standalone moratorium_**

Pursuant to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, a free standing moratorium is available to
protect certain companies, both UK and overseas if there is a sufficient connection with England, from
creditor action for a specified period, granting a ‘payment holiday’ for ‘pre moratorium debts’. Pre
moratorium debts are debts due prior to the moratorium coming into force or debts which become due during
the moratorium if they relate to obligations incurred before the moratorium comes into force. The moratorium
is similar in scope to that which applies in administration, preventing security enforcement and legal
proceedings amongst other things. Like the moratorium which applies in administration, this moratorium
does not apply to financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the
meaning of the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations. Unlike the moratorium which applies in
administration, this moratorium prevents the crystallization of a floating charge. In order to be eligible for the
moratorium a company must be or be likely to be unable to pay its debts and the moratorium must be likely to
result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. The moratorium will be overseen by a licensed
insolvency practitioner who will act as a monitor. The monitor will scrutinize the company for the duration of
the moratorium, assessing whether it is likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as
a going concern. However, there are broad exclusions including for companies which are party to a capital
markets arrangement, which will apply in this case once the Notes have been issued.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the UK Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator as applicable)
may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a
compromise of the company’s unsecured debts. The company may propose whatever compromise they
consider appropriate in accordance with the duties of the directors or administrator (as applicable) and,
provided that compromise is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure,
it will bind all unsecured creditors of the company who were entitled to vote on the proposal or would have
been entitled to vote on the proposal (notwithstanding the terms and approval thresholds contained in the
finance documents). A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce
its security, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement to be passed, it must be approved by both: (a) 75% or more
by value of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure; and (b) 50% by value of the
creditors that are unconnected with the company. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary
arrangement. However, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor
who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up
its security.

**_Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_**

One of the common challenges involved in using a formal process to rescue and restructure a company is that
it can trigger termination or other consequences under supplier contracts. This makes the company vulnerable
to ransom creditors. Recent changes to the UK Insolvency Act have been introduced in order to supplement
the existing essential supplier regime (see below) to help the continuation of supply of goods and services to
companies in an insolvency process.

**_Essential suppliers_**

The essential supplier regime under sections 233 and 233A of the UK Insolvency Act prevents the suppliers
from, where a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including administration,
liquidation and CVA) and a request is made by or with the concurrence of the insolvency officerholder for the
giving, after the date that insolvency procedure commenced or the CVA took effect (as applicable), of any
essential supplies, making it a condition of the giving of the supply, or doing anything which has the effect of
making it a condition of the giving of the supply, that any outstanding charges in respect of a supply given to
the company before the effective date are paid; and (ii) where a company enters administration or a CVA takes
effect, subject to certain exceptions, compels continued supply by restricting the effect of existing insolvencyrelated terms in contracts for the supply of essential goods or services.

Essential goods and services include such things as water, gas, electricity, communications services, wi-fi and
chip-and-pin devices.

**_Other suppliers_**

Section 233B of the UK Insolvency Act says that (subject to certain exceptions), if a company is subject to a
qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including the new moratorium, CVA, administration and liquidation


-----

or where a court order is made summoning a meeting relating to a Restructuring Plan), (i) any provision of a
supply contract which provides that the contract or supply would terminate, or any other thing would take
place, or that the supplier would be entitled to terminate the contract or the supply or do any other thing (for
example, change payment or supply terms) because the company becomes subject to the relevant insolvency
procedure, will cease to have effect; (ii) suppliers will be unable to exercise any entitlement arising before the
start of the insolvency period to terminate the contract or the supply because of an event occurring before the
start of the insolvency period, for the duration of the insolvency period (which in some cases could be
measured in years) and (iii) suppliers will be unable to impose ransoms by demanding payment of outstanding
amounts in respect of pre-commencement supply as a condition of continuing supply.

Suppliers may still terminate contracts if the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court
grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier
hardship. Supplier rights relating to events arising after the insolvency process begins are not affected.

The prohibitions apply to both new and pre-existing contracts. The restrictions do not apply to a range of
contracts involving financial services including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or
guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or
form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the UK Insolvency
Act). In addition, certain types of entities (such as banks or insurance companies), whether such entities are
the customer or the supplier, are excluded from this regime. Additionally, the regime does not apply to
insolvency-related terms of a contract for the supply of essential goods or services which cease to have effect
under section 233A of the UK Insolvency Act (as described above).

**TAXATION**

**CERTAIN GERMAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Income received from the Notes is subject to taxation. In particular, the tax laws of any jurisdiction with authority_
_to impose taxes on the holder and the tax laws of the Issuer’s state of incorporation, statutory seat and place of_
_effective management, i.e., Germany, might have an impact on the income received from the Notes._

_The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and disposal_
_of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be_
_relevant to a decision to purchase Notes, and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances_
_that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force_
_and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or_
_retrospective effect._

_Potential purchasers of the Notes should be aware that (i) the tax treatment of payments in respect of the Notes_
_may be different (and in some cases significantly different) from that set out below, and (ii) tax laws and_
_regulations and their application or interpretation by the relevant taxation authorities or courts may change from_
_time to time (including the flat tax rate described below). Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the precise tax_
_treatment of the Notes which will apply to a particular investor at any given time._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of_
_the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes, including the effect of any state, local or church taxes, under_
_the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are resident or whose tax laws apply to them for other_
_reasons._

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing payments, such as interest payments, received by an individual holder of the Notes will be subject to
German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account
with a German financial institution (i.e., a bank, a financial services institution or a securities institution) and
such entity credits or pays out the interest, or—if no German branch of a German or non-German credit or
financial services institution or German securities institution is the Disbursing Agent—the Issuer (each, a
“Disbursing Agent”, auszahlende Stelle). The term German financial institution includes a German branch of
a foreign financial institution but not a foreign branch of a German financial institution. The withholding tax
rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding
being 26.375%); with respect to the solidarity surcharge see “—Partial Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge”.
If the individual holder is subject to church tax (Kirchensteuer), a church tax surcharge will also be withheld.
The church tax surcharge is automatically withheld by the Disbursing Agent, unless the holder notifies the
Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) that it objects to automatic withholding. In this
case, the holder has to include the capital investment income in his or her tax return and will be assessed to
church tax (if applicable).

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest”,
_Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder irrespective of any holding period provided the Notes have been_
held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If Notes held
or managed in the same custodial account were acquired at different points in time, the Notes first acquired
will be deemed to have been sold first for the purposes of determining any capital gains. Where the Notes are
acquired and/or sold in a currency other than Euro, the sales/redemption price and/or the acquisition costs
have to be converted into euro on the basis of the foreign exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption
date and the acquisition date, respectively. The separation of interest claims from the Notes is treated as
disposition of the Notes at their fair market value which has to be apportioned to the capital and the interest
strips. If interest claims or interest coupons are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds
from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption or
collection of interest claims or interest coupons if the Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since
the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies
at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus
church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (including Accrued Interest, if any), unless the
current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the


-----

previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services or securities institution within the
European Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries, e.g., Switzerland.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the
withholding tax negative capital investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the
Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares) and carry forward
any losses that cannot be offset to the following calendar year. If losses cannot be offset in full against positive
capital investment income by the Disbursing Agent, the holder can instead request that the Disbursing Agent
issues a certificate stating the losses in order for them to be offset against other positive income from capital
investments or carried forward in the assessment procedure. The request has to reach the Disbursing Agent by
15 December of the current year and is irrevocable. The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest
on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the
Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may
credit foreign withholding taxes levied on capital investment income in a given year regarding securities held
by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent,
the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die
_Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be_
withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if
the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment
(Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax office.

Subject to further (procedural) requirements being met, German withholding tax will generally not apply to
gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a
German tax resident (including Notes held via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided
that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the tax status of the corporation has been evidenced by
a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are generally
subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same applies
where the Notes form part of a German trade or business (of an individual or a commercial partnership)
subject to further requirements being met.

Interest and capital gains on the Notes received by non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to
German withholding tax or the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is
subject to German taxation (as set forth under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non Tax
_Residents”) and the Notes are held or managed in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding_
tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be (fully or partially) refunded based
on an assessment to tax or under an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

Payments made to a holder of the Notes resident in a so called “non-cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht
_kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) within the meaning of the Defense against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur_
_Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze—”StAbwG”)_
should be subject to a (definitive) tax deduction by the Issuer in Germany at a tax rate of 15% (plus solidarity
surcharge in an amount of 5.5% of such tax) of the gross payment. However, according to recently introduced
legislation, there should be no obligation to deduct tax in the case of bearer notes
(Inhaberschuldverschreibungen) represented by a global note (Globalurkunde), and held in collective safe
custody (Girosammelverwahrung) with a central depositary or similar instruments that are tradable on certain
recognized stock exchanges. The exact scope of this new exemption is, however, still unclear.

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management is located in Germany).

Income (i.e. interest and capital gains) derived under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident
in Germany, irrespective of any holding period, is in general subject to German income tax at a flat tax rate
of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are
held as private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled
to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer—Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for married couples and for


-----

partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft)
filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not
deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld. To the extent
withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment
process, the individual holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the Notes in his
or her tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable,
church tax thereon). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been
calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), an individual holder may,
and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds, must apply for an assessment on the
basis of his or her actual acquisition costs unless, according to administrative guidance, the difference between
the actual gain and 30% of the respective proceeds does not exceed €500 and there are no further circumstances
requiring a tax assessment. Further, an individual holder may apply for a tax assessment on the basis of
general rules applicable to him or her if the resulting individual income tax burden is lower than 25% with any
amounts of German tax over withheld being refunded. The deduction of expenses (other than transaction
costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted.

Capital losses from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes held as private investment
should generally be tax-recognized irrespective of the holding period of the Notes. The losses may, however,
not be used to offset other income like employment or business income but may only be offset against capital
investment income subject to certain limitations. Losses not utilized in one year may be carried forward into
subsequent years but may not be carried back into preceding years. However, if the losses result from the full
or partial non-recoverability of the repayment claim under the Notes including a default of the Issuer or a
(voluntary) waiver, or from a write-off of worthless notes, from the transfer of worthless notes to a third party
or from any other default (Ausfall), such losses together with other losses of such kind of the same year and
loss-carry forwards of previous years can only be offset up to an amount of €20,000 per annum (“Limitation
**on Loss Deduction”). Any exceeding loss amount can be carried forward and offset against future capital**
investment income, but again subject to the €20,000 limitation. Given that the Limitation on Loss Deduction
will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent (as defined above) holding the Notes in custody, holders
suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare such losses in
their income tax return.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or where the income from
the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not
satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate
income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Where Notes form part of a
trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income.
The respective holder will have to include income and related (business) expenses in the tax return and the
balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as
advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding
this personal or corporate income tax liability, will be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or
business the current income and capital gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the
Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the
municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) of the relevant municipality where the holder’s business is
located. If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may be completely
or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

Partnerships can opt to be treated as a corporation for purposes of German income taxation. If the holder of
the Notes is a partnership that has validly exercised such option right, any interest payments on Notes
(including Accrued Interest) and capital gains from the disposal or redemption of Notes are subject to
corporate income tax (and, for the avoidance of doubt, trade tax).

_Non Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management is not located in Germany).

Interest, including Accrued Interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from
the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax resident
in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business


-----

property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in
Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (e.g., such as income
from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German situs real estate (or other assets that are
from a German civil law perspective treated as real estate) or ships which are registered with a German ship
register (unless the Notes qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of Section 9a of the
German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibung))
or income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs real estate or income from profit participating
instruments). Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German
withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over the counter payment by a German
Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. To the
extent the German source income is subject to German withholding tax, this withholding tax is, in general
final and the German tax liability is satisfied by the tax withheld. Where the German source income is not
subject to German withholding tax or in case (i) of this paragraph (i.e., if Notes form part of the business
property of a German permanent establishment), a tax regime similar to that explained above under “—Tax
_Residents” applies. Subject to certain requirements, a holder who is not tax resident in Germany may benefit_
from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable double taxation treaty
(Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen) and German tax law.

Where the Issuer makes a tax deduction from a payment to a holder of the Notes tax resident in a noncooperative jurisdiction under the StAbwG (as set forth under “—Withholding Tax”), such holder should in
principle incur a definitive tax charge.

**_Bond Premium_**

If the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen) and if a German holder purchases a Note for an
amount (not including any amount paid for pre issuance accrued interest) that is greater than the principal
amount of the Note, the bond premium is part of the acquisition costs which are deducted from the proceeds
upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes.

According to the German tax authority, German holders, holding the Notes as their trade or business assets
(Betriebsvermögen) could be obliged to create a deferred item (Rechnungsabgrenzungsposten) in the amount of
the bond premium which is to be dissolved linearly over the term of the Note. Moreover, under certain
circumstances, the German Holder may amortize (wholly or partly) a bond premium before disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes.

**_Partial Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge_**

As of the assessment period 2021, the solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished for certain individuals
and reduced for certain other individuals, depending on certain income thresholds. The solidarity surcharge
continues to apply for capital investment income and, thus, on withholding taxes levied (including the flat tax
regime) as well as to corporate income tax. In case the individual income tax burden for an individual holder
is lower than 25%, the holder can apply for his or her capital investment income being assessed at his or her
individual tariff-based income tax rate in which case solidarity surcharge would be refunded. Holders are
advised to monitor further future developments.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift tax
if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or
deemed to be a resident of Germany or in certain cases for German citizens who previously maintained a
residence in Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of
Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied if the Notes qualify as
fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibung) unless (i) the Notes are attributable to a
German trade or business for which a permanent establishment or fixed base is maintained or a permanent
representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii), the obligations under the Notes are directly or indirectly
secured by German-situs real estate (or other real estate-like rights) or ships which are registered with a
German ship register (unless the Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)).

In addition, certain German expatriates will be subject to inheritance and gift tax. Should a double taxation
treaty be applicable in the individual case, however, German taxation provisions may be restricted thereby.


-----

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes will be payable in Germany in connection with the issuance, delivery or
execution of the Notes. However, under certain conditions, entrepreneurs (for VAT purposes) may opt for a
liability to value added tax with regard to the sale of the Notes which would otherwise be tax exempt.
Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**_The Proposed Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)_**

In 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transaction
tax (“FTT”) in certain EU Member States. The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced
in the form of the proposal, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions)
in certain circumstances. The proposed FTT Directive has not yet been implemented. However, some
jurisdictions (e.g., Italy and France) have introduced a domestic financial transaction tax that may apply to
certain dealings in the Securities in certain circumstances. Other jurisdictions may also introduce a domestic
financial transaction tax. Subject to the final scope of any FTT, holders of the Notes could be exposed to
higher transaction fees.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT and
domestic financial transaction taxes.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion is limited to U.S. holders (defined below)
who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a
substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public (not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons
or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers)) and hold the Notes
as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code, as amended
(the “Code”) (generally assets held for investment purposes). The following discussion does not address certain
considerations that may apply to particular holders including, but not limited to, tax exempt entities, holders
subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, U.S. expatriates, dealers in securities or currencies, traders
in securities who elect to apply a mark to market method of accounting, certain financial institutions,
insurance companies, regulated investment companies, partnerships or other pass through entities (or
investors in such entities), U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar, persons who hold
the Notes in connection with a “straddle”, “hedging”, “conversion” or other risk reduction transaction, and
holders in their capacity as holders of (i) the Existing Floating Rate Notes and (ii) the Existing Fixed Rate
Notes. This discussion does not address the tax considerations relevant to holders of the Notes under any
state, local or non U.S. tax laws or any other tax laws other than the U.S. federal income tax laws, or the
consequences to taxpayers that are required to accelerate income in accordance with their specified financial
accounts.

The discussion below is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury
**Regulations”), court decisions, revenue rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue**
Service (the “IRS”) currently in force, all as of the date of this Offering, and all of which are subject to change
or changes in interpretation. Prospective investors should particularly note that any such change or changes
in interpretation could have retroactive effect so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different
from those discussed below. Consequently, prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the
consequences of holding the Notes.

As used herein, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state or political subdivision
thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons control all of the substantial decisions of
the trust or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.


-----

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is an owner of the Notes, the U.S. tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities
of the partnership. A holder of the Notes that is a partnership and partners in such partnership should
consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing
of the Notes.

**Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences**
**to them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the tax consequences under any state,**
**local, non-U.S. and other tax laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of the
_Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control”) we may be obligated to make_
payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. If (i) the exercise of the Issuer’s option to
redeem the Notes is not remote and (ii) it is not significantly more likely than not that no Change of Control
will occur, the Notes could be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be
treated as contingent payment debt instruments. This position is binding on a holder unless such holder
discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such
position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional
payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the
Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest
income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity, to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any
gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of such a Note, and to recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income. This disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be
considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors
regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the
consequences thereof.

**_Interest_**

Payments of stated interest (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of
withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) on a
Note generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as foreign source ordinary interest
income at the time the interest is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. holder’s method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be
considered passive category income).

A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
that receives a payment of stated interest will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro
interest payment (translated at the “spot rate”on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize exchange gain or
loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposition of the euros so received.

A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or
who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, will be required to include in ordinary income the
U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in euros that has accrued with respect to a Note during an
accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income may be determined by translating such income
at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two
taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period within each taxable year. Alternatively, an accrual
basis holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to
year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot
rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period
within each taxable year, in the case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year), or at the spot
rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S.
holder of a Note that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes may
recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received.
The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value
of the euro payment received (translated at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is received) in respect of


-----

such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued during such accrual period
(as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. Such exchange
gain or loss will generally constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as
U.S. source income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income and expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such
event, U.S. holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will generally
include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue
price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount
(generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity
from the issue date).

In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note of such series
includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for
each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily
portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that
accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the
term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of
principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that
accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price”
at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity”, determined on the basis of compounding
at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of
stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual
period is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by
any payments other than stated interest. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used
in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an
amount equal to the issue price of the Note.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S.
dollars in accordance with one of the methods described above in the third paragraph under “—Interest”.

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the
disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in
income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received,
determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the
accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note (other
than payments of stated interest) will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent
thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and second, as receipts of
principal. Such foreign currency gain or loss will generally constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated,
for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment
to interest income and expense The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay
between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss above, stated interest income (including any amounts
withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the
Notes) and OID, if any, on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be
considered “passive category income”in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S.
federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such
holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, subject to applicable limitations. If a U.S. holder does not meet a minimum holding period with
respect to the Notes during which the holder is not protected from risk of loss, such holder generally will not
receive a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes. The rules governing the foreign
tax credit are complex. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that


-----

depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their independent tax advisors
regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Sale and Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to
accrued and unpaid stated interest, which, to the extent not previously included in income, will be taxable as
ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above
and exchange gain or loss on such accrued and unpaid interest) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the euro
purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date, increased by
prior accruals of OID, if any. The amount realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a Note for an
amount of euros will be the U.S. dollar value of that amount on (i) the date payment is received in the case of
a cash basis U.S. holder, (ii) the date of disposition in the case of an accrual basis U.S. holder, or (iii) the
settlement date (if the Note is traded on an established securities market) in the case of a cash basis U.S.
holder (and, if it elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder). If the Note is traded on an established securities market,
a U.S. holder will have a tax basis in the euro received equal to the U.S. dollar value of such amount on the
settlement date. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described in this paragraph, the election
must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a Note that is
attributable to changes in currency exchange rates relating to the principal thereof will be ordinary income or
loss and will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase
price of the Note in euros, determined on the date of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition, and the
U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in euros, determined on the date the U.S.
holder acquired the Note. In addition, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect
to amounts of previously accrued interest and accrued OID, if any, based on the difference between the rate
of exchange at which the interest or OID was included in income and the applicable rate of exchange at which
the holder is required to translate euros at the time the Note matures or is otherwise disposed of. The foregoing
foreign exchange gain or loss will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S.
holder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Note.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale,
exchange or other disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long term
capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year at the time of the sale or other disposition.
In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any such long term capital gain generally will be subject to preferential
U.S. federal income tax rates if that U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.

**_Receipt of Euros_**

The tax basis of any euros received by a U.S. holder generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the euros at
the spot rate of exchange on the date the euros are received. Upon any subsequent exchange of euros for U.S.
dollars, a U.S. holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
of U.S. dollars received and the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euros. Upon any subsequent exchange of euros
for property (including non U.S. currency), a U.S. holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal
to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euros exchanged for such property based on the U.S.
dollar spot rate of exchange for euros on the date of the exchange and the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euros
so exchanged. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS including, in
certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency
received in respect of a Note to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
results in a foreign currency tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If investors fail to timely file a required
disclosure under these rules, substantial penalties can apply. Potential investors should consult with their own
tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes.


-----

**_U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of interest, accruals of OID, if any, and proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of
a Note may be reported to the IRS unless the holder establishes a basis for exemption. Backup withholding
may apply to amounts subject to reporting if the holder fails to timely provide an accurate taxpayer
identification number or fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal
income tax returns. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. A holder can claim a credit against its U.S.
federal income tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding and a refund of any excess.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain owners of “specified foreign financial assets”with an aggregate value in excess of U.S.$50,000 (and in
some circumstances, a higher threshold), will generally be required to file an information report on IRS
Form 8938 with respect to such assets with their U.S. federal tax returns. “Specified foreign financial assets”
include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but
only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks
and securities issued by non United States persons, (ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non
United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities. Such reporting requirement may
also apply to certain non-individual holders. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
application of this reporting requirement to their ownership of Notes.

**_Medicare Tax_**

Certain U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be
subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on some or all of such U.S. holder’s “net investment income”. Net
investment income generally includes interest on, and gain from the disposition of, the Notes unless such
interest income or gain is derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a
trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the effect this tax may have, if any, on their acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

Subject to the following discussion, the Notes may be acquired by an “employee benefit plan” as defined in
Section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), that is
subject to Title I of ERISA, a “plan” as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including
individual retirement accounts) or an entity deemed to hold “plan assets” within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101 (as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) of the foregoing (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”),
as well as by “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), “church plans” (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA) or non-U.S. plans that are subject to any applicable state, local, non-U.S. or other
laws that are substantially similar to the fiduciary and prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”) (collectively, with Benefit Plan Investors, referred to as
“Plans”).

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit a Benefit Plan Investor from engaging in certain
transactions with persons that are “parties in interest”(as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA) or “disqualified
persons” (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to such Benefit Plan Investor unless an
exemption is available. A violation of these “prohibited transaction” rules may result in an excise tax or other
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code for such persons or the fiduciaries of such Benefit
Plan Investor. A Plan that is not a Benefit Plan Investor may be subject to similar restrictions under Similar
Law.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the Under
ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration
of a Benefit Plan Investor or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Benefit Plan Investor, or
who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Benefit Plan Investor, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the Benefit Plan Investor.

ERISA requires fiduciaries of a Benefit Plan Investor subject to ERISA to make investments that are prudent,
diversified and in accordance with the governing plan documents. In considering an investment in the Notes
of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should consult with its counsel in order to determine the
suitability of the Notes for such Plan, including whether the investment is in accordance with the documents
and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law
relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification,
delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Law.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Guarantors or any of
their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide
impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary
capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and
materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are
not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of
investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made
solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by or on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor could be considered to
give rise to a prohibited transaction if any Transaction Party is or becomes, a party in interest or a disqualified
person with respect to such Benefit Plan Investor. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules
could be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor depending on the
type and circumstances of the plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire the Notes and the relationship of
the party in interest to the Benefit Plan Investor. Included among these exemptions are: Section 408(b)(17) of
ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Benefit Plan Investor and
non-fiduciary service providers to the Benefit Plan Investor; Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption
(“PTCE”) 96-23, regarding transactions effected by in-house asset managers; PTCE 95-60, regarding
investments by insurance company general accounts; PTCE 91-38, regarding investments by bank collective
investment funds; PTCE 90-1, regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; and
PTCE 84-14, regarding transactions effected by qualified professional asset managers. Even if the conditions


-----

specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of the relief provided by these exemptions
might or might not cover all acts which might be construed as prohibited transactions. There can be no
assurance that any of these, or any other exemption, will be available with respect to any particular transaction
involving the Notes, and prospective acquirers that are Benefit Plan Investors should consult with their legal
advisors regarding the applicability of any such exemption.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any Plan or person investing “plan
assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (i) are entitled to exemption relief from the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible under all Similar Law or
(ii) would not otherwise constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or any violation of Similar Law.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor should it be construed
as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons
considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel
regarding the suitability of an acquisition of the Notes in light of such prospective purchaser’s particular
circumstances, potential applicability of Section 406 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar
Law to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the
Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any of Transaction Parties or their
respective representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.

**Representation**

By acquiring a Note (or interest therein), each purchaser and transferee (and if the purchaser or transferee is
a Plan, its fiduciary) is deemed to represent, warrant and covenant that (A) either (i) it is not acquiring the
Note (or interest therein) with the assets of a Plan; or (ii) (x) the acquisition and holding of the Note (or
interest therein) will not give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of Similar Law and (y) none of the Transaction Parties is acting, or
will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes or is undertaking
to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the decision to
purchase or hold the Notes and (B) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the Note (or interest therein) other
than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and covenants
with respect to its acquisition of the Note (or interest therein).


-----

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes will be represented by two global notes in bearer form, without interest coupons attached.
One global note (the “144A Global Note”) will represent Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
to Rule 144A, and one global note (the “Regulation S Global Note” and together with the 144A Global Note,
the “Global Notes”) will represent Notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons pursuant to
Regulation S.

Upon issuance, each of the Global Notes will be deposited with and immobilized, and held by Clearstream
Banking AG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, (“Clearstream Banking”) and will be kept in custody by
Clearstream Banking until all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes have been satisfied. Definitive notes
representing individual Notes and interest coupons will not be issued.

All interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of Clearstream Banking.
The Notes will be transferable, subject to the limitations and procedures described below under “—Transfers”,
by appropriate entries in securities accounts in accordance with applicable rules of Clearstream Banking. The
Notes will not be eligible for clearance through the facilities of the Depositary Trust Company.

Pursuant to the Book-Entry Registration Agreement between the Issuer and Clearstream Banking to be dated
on or about the Issue Date, the Issuer has appointed Clearstream Banking as its book-entry registrar (the
“Book-Entry Registrar”) in respect of the Notes and agreed on an agent for the Issuer to maintain (i) a
register reflecting the aggregate number of Notes represented by each Global Note in accordance with the
Conditions of Issue and (ii) a register (the “Book-Entry Register”) containing records of the Notes credited to
the accounts of the accountholders of Clearstream Banking, for the benefit of the Holders of the coownership interests (Miteigentumsanteile) in the Notes represented by the Global Notes.

The Issuer and Clearstream Banking have agreed, for the benefit of the Holders of co-ownership interests in
the Notes, that the actual number of Notes represented by each Global Note from time to time shall be
evidenced by the records of the Book Entry Registrar. No transfer of any Note through the clearing system
shall be effective unless it is recorded in the Book Entry Register. Ownership of interests in each Global Note
will be limited to persons who have accounts with Clearstream Banking (“participants”) or persons who hold
interests through participants (“indirect participants”).

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Clearstream Banking will be effected in accordance with the applicable
rules of Clearstream Banking rules and, outside of the Federal Republic of Germany, of Clearstream
Banking, (42 Avenue JF Kennedy, 1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg) and Euroclear Bank SA/NV (Boulevard
du Roi Albert II, 1210 Brussels, Belgium) as operator of the Euroclear System and any successor in such
capacity, and will be settled in immediately available funds. The Notes will be transferable only in minimum
aggregate principal amounts of €100,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. Each Global
Note and interests in each Global Note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and “Plan of Distribution—Selling and Transfer Restrictions”._

The Notes represented by the 144A Global Note may be exchanged for Notes represented by the
Regulation S Global Note and vice versa, except that no such exchange can be effected in the period starting
three business days prior to any payment of principal, interest or any other amount under the Conditions of
Issue until (and including) the date of such payment.

If a holder who holds a book-entry interest in the 144A Global Note wishes at any time to exchange its
interest in the 144A Global Note for an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, or to transfer its interest in
the 144A Global Note to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in the
Regulation S Global Note, it may, subject to the rules and procedures of the clearing system and the
requirements set forth in this paragraph, exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of such interest for an
equivalent interest in the Regulation S Global Note. Such exchange or transfer shall only be made upon:

(a) receipt by the Transfer Agent of a certificate, in the form obtainable from the Transfer Agent, given
by such holder (i) instructing the Transfer Agent to credit or cause to be credited an interest in the
Regulation S Global Note in an amount equal to the interest in the 144A Global Note of the same
series to be exchanged or transferred, (ii) containing information regarding the account to be
credited with such increase and instructing the Transfer Agent to make arrangements to deliver such


-----

increase to such account, and (iii) stating that the exchange or transfer of such interest has been
made pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 under
the U.S. Securities Act; and

(b) transfer of its interest in the 144A Global Note to be transferred or exchanged to the account of the
Transfer Agent with the clearing system designated by the Transfer Agent.

After the relevant distribution compliance date, the certification requirement set forth in clause (a)(iii) of the
immediately preceding sentence will no longer apply to such transfers. The “Relevant Distribution Compliance
**Date” means the 40-day period following the issue date for the Notes.**

If a Holder who holds a book-entry interest in the Regulation S Global Note wishes at any time to exchange
its interest in the Regulation S Global Note for an interest in the 144A Global Note, or to transfer its interest
in the Regulation S Global Note to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in
the 144A Global Note, it may, subject to the rules and procedures of the clearing system and the requirements
set forth in this paragraph, exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of such interest for an equivalent interest
in the 144A Global Note. Such exchange or transfer shall only be made upon:

(a) receipt by the Transfer Agent of a certificate, in the form obtainable from the Transfer Agent, given
by such holder (i) instructing the Transfer Agent to credit or cause to be credited an interest in the
144A Global Note in an amount equal to the interest in the Regulation S Global Note to be
exchanged or transferred, (ii) containing information regarding the account to be credited with such
increase and instructing the Transfer Agent to make arrangements to deliver such increase to such
account, and (iii) if such transfer or exchange is to be made prior to or on the Relevant Distribution
Compliance Date, stating that such Holder reasonably believes that the person acquiring such
interest in such 144A Global Note is a qualified institutional buyer (as defined in Rule 144A under
the U.S. Securities Act) and is obtaining such beneficial interest in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and any applicable securities laws of any
state of the United States or any other jurisdiction; and

(b) transfer of its interest in the Regulation S Global Note to be transferred or exchanged to the account
of the Transfer Agent with the Clearing System designated by the Transfer Agent.

Any exchange of Notes represented by the 144A Global Note for Notes represented by the Regulation S
Global Note, or vice versa, shall be recorded on the register and shall be effected by an increase or a reduction
in the aggregate amount represented by the Rule 144A Global Note by the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes so exchanged and a corresponding reduction or increase in the aggregate principal amount of Notes
represented by the Regulation S Global Note.

Pursuant to an agreement dated on or about the Issue Date between the Issuer and Clearstream Banking, the
Issuer has appointed Clearstream Banking as the Book-Entry Registrar. The Book-Entry Registrar has agreed
to maintain the Book-Entry Register, as agent of the Issuer, showing the interests of Clearstream Banking
accountholders in the Global Notes. No transfer of any Note through the clearing system shall be effective
unless it is recorded in the Book-Entry Register. On any redemption of, or payment of an installment on, or
purchase and cancellation of, any of the Notes represented by a Global Note the Issuer shall procure that
details of any redemption, payment or purchase and cancellation (as the case may be) in respect of that
Global Note shall be entered accordingly in the register and, upon any such entry being made, the principal
amount of the Notes represented by the Global Notes shall be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes so redeemed or purchased and cancelled or by the aggregate amount of such installment so paid
and appropriate entries shall be made in the Book-Entry Register by the Book-Entry Registrar.

**Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes**

The following summaries of those operations and procedures are provided herein solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system
and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers is responsible for
those operations or procedures.

The Issuer and the Guarantors understand the following with respect to Clearstream Banking:

   - Clearstream Banking holds securities for participating organizations and facilitates the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of those participants;


-----

   - Clearstream Banking provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping,
administration, clearance and settlement of securities and securities lending and borrowing;

   - Clearstream Banking participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers
and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations; and

   - indirect access to Clearstream Banking is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Clearstream
Banking participant, either directly or indirectly.

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes will be made by the Issuer in
Euros to the Paying Agent, which will pay such amounts to Clearstream Banking, as the holder of the Global
Notes. Clearstream Banking will, in turn, distribute those payments to its participants in accordance with its
procedures. Payments by participants and indirect participants of Clearstream Banking to the owners of
interests in a Global Note will be the responsibility of those participants or indirect participants.

Investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications relating to the
Notes through Clearstream Banking on days when the Clearstream Banking system is open for business. That
system may not be open for business on certain days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for
business in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications in
connection with completing transactions through Clearstream Banking on the same business day as in the
United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer an interest in a Global Note or to receive or make a payment
or delivery of such an interest on a particular day may find that the transaction will not be performed until the
next business day in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

**ACTION BY OWNERS OF BOOK-ENTRY INTERESTS**

Clearstream Banking has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the book-entry interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Clearstream Banking will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes.

Book-entry interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements as discussed in “Plan of Distribution—Selling and Transfer Restrictions”.


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale,_
_pledge or other transfer of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or any
state securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and other
applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold only (i) to “qualified
institutional buyers”(as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A
and (ii) to persons other than “U.S. persons”(as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) outside
the United States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S.

The Issuer uses the terms “offshore transaction”, “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings given
to them in Regulation S.

acknowledged, represented and agreed with us, each Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under
the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Notes are being offered
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other

transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set
out in paragraphs (5) and (6) below;

(2) It is neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144), nor acting on its behalf and that either;

(a) it is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of these Notes to it will
be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the
account of another QIB; or

(b) it is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer and its
subsidiaries or the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this
offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is
relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the
Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or
warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum. It has had access to
such financial and other information concerning the Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Notes that it
deems necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an
opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers;

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale
in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property
of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or
their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the U.S.
Securities Act;

(5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the
Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree,
to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination
**Date”) that is, in the case of the Rule 144A Notes, one year after the latest of the original issue date**
of the Notes, the original issue date of the issuance of any Additional Notes and the last date on
which the Issuer or any of its affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor thereof) or,
in the case of the Regulation S Notes, 40 days after the later of the original issue date and the last
date on which the Notes were first offered to persons other than Distributors (as defined in Rule 902


-----

of Regulation S), only (i) to the Issuer or the Guarantors; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement
that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Notes are
eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases
for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being
made in reliance on Rule 144A; (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States
in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S; or (v) pursuant to any other available
exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the
foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any
applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to
the Issuer and the Holders’ Representative’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer
(I) pursuant to clause (v) above to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and
other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that
a certificate of transfer is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Holders’ Representative.
The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination
Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM.


-----

If the Notes are issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Notes will
bear the following legend:

ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT. THE NOTES HAVE BEEN ISSUED WITH ORIGINAL ISSUE
DISCOUNT (“OID”) FOR UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. IN SUCH
CASE, THE ISSUE PRICE, THE AMOUNT OF OID, THE ISSUE DATE AND THE YIELD TO
MATURITY MAY BE OBTAINED BY CONTACTING THE ISSUER AT WEPA
HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, DEPARTMENT OF INVESTOR RELATIONS, RÖNKHAUSER
STRASSE 26, 59757 ARNSBERG, GERMANY.

A purchaser of Notes will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to Holders
of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to Holders of these Notes.

(6) It understands that the issuance of Additional Notes under the Conditions of Issue may have the
effect of extending the Resale Restriction Termination Date;

(7) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on
the transfer of such Notes;

(8) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, any offer or sale of the
Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate
the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than
in accordance with Rule 144A;

(9) It acknowledges that the Book-Entry Registrar and Transfer Agent will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory
to the Issuer, Transfer Agent and the Book-Entry Registrar that the restrictions set out therein have
been complied with;

(10) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the
truth and accuracy of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees
that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have
been made by your purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer
and the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more
investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such
investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations
and agreements on behalf of each such investor account; and

(11) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the
Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or
the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material
relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set out under “Plan
_of Distribution” and “European Economic Area” “._


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

**General**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to HSBC Continental Europe, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, J.P. Morgan
SE and Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft (together, the “Initial Purchasers”), and the Initial Purchasers have
agreed, subject to certain customary closing conditions, to subscribe to and pay for the Notes on the Issue
Date.

The sale will be made pursuant to an agreement among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers
dated the date hereof (the “Purchase Agreement”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase
Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, together with all other Initial Purchasers, all of the
Notes. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by the
Issuer’s and their counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will
indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act.
The Issuer has furthermore agreed to reimburse the Initial Purchasers for certain expenses incurred in
connection with the issue of the Notes. In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have made
certain representations and given certain warranties in respect of their respective legal and financial matters.
The Initial Purchasers are entitled, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Purchase Agreement. In
such event, no Notes will be delivered to investors.

**No Sale of Similar Securities**

The Issuer has agreed that it or its affiliates and subsidiaries will not, directly or indirectly, except through the
Initial Purchasers or as otherwise approved by them, sell or offer to sell any securities that are substantially
similar to the Notes until 90 days after the Issue Date.

**New Issue of Notes**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made to The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in
the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is no assurance
that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will
be granted, or that such listing will be maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole
option at any time, without the consent of the Holders or the Holders’ Representative, de list the Notes from
any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of the Notes to another recognized stock exchange
for high yield issuers (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union). The
Initial Purchasers have advised us that it intends to make a market in the Notes after completion of the
Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market
making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to
the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, it cannot be assured that
any market for the Notes will develop, or that such market will be liquid if it does develop, or that an investor
will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable.

**Stamp Tax**

Persons that purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering
price.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, HSBC Continental Europe (the “Stabilizing Manager”) (or persons acting
on its behalf) may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over allotment,
stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over allotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions
involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the
price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after
the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers
to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are
purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be effected
in the over the counter market or otherwise.


-----

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price
of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither the Issuer
nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect
that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, there is no obligation
on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers
make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that these
transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilizing action, if commenced,
must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of
the Notes.

**Initial Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefore on or about the date specified
on the cover page of the offering memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6 1 under the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on
the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish
to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next succeeding business days should consult their own
advisor.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and/or certain of their respective affiliates have provided, currently provide and/or,
from time to time, may provide in the future, investment banking, commercial banking (including hedging
transactions), cash management, asset-backed securities programs, consulting, rating, and financial advisory
and/or other banking services to the Issuer and its affiliates for which they may receive customary advisory
and transaction fees, commissions and expense reimbursement. In addition, certain Initial Purchasers and/or
their affiliates (including HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft) are lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility to which,
_inter alios, the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries are parties. In addition, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft_
acts as facility agent under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and as the Security Agent.
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft is also a party to the ABS Program. If the Initial Purchasers and/or their
affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer and/or its affiliates (e.g. under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility), they may likely hedge their credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, they would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the
Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading
prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments.

**Selling and Transfer Restrictions**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
qualified for sale under the securities laws of any U.S. state or any jurisdiction outside the United States and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non U.S.
persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Accordingly, the Notes will be subject to
significant restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors”, “European Economic
_Area” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A_
will be made by broker dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act. Until 40 days after the later
of (i) the commencement of this offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes
initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in
the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made
otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph
have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.

The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. The Initial Purchasers
have advised us that, following the completion of this Offering, they currently intend to make a market in the
Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do


-----

so, and the Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making activities with respect to the Notes at any
time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any market for the Notes will develop,
that it will be liquid and that you will be able to sell any of the Notes held by you at a particular time or that
the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may_
_be limited”. Each purchaser of the Notes, by its purchase of the Notes, will be deemed to have made certain_
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors” and
“European Economic Area”.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

   - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received
by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of
the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors); and

   - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available
and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the
purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the
following (i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, “retail investor” means a
person who is on (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and
any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom,
by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the
Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered
or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession
this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions
relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to
_the Investors”, “European Economic Area” and “Transfer Restrictions”._

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge
or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale,
pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities
Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the
Notes.


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany. Other Guarantors are
incorporated in Poland, Italy, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. None of the directors,
officers or other executives of the Issuer and the Guarantors are residents or citizens of the United States.
Therefore, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors, officers or
executives. Furthermore, since the assets of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their respective
directors and officers are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against
the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil
liabilities under U.S. Federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States.

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a
judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards,
in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be
enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and
enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings
set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court
generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted
below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a
number of factors, including the following:

   - the judgment being valid and final under U.S. federal or state law;

   - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

   - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely
served complaint;

   - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a
recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court;

   - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the matter
(Verfahren) pending before a German court, provided that such German matter was pending before
a German court prior to the U.S. court entered its judgment;

   - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial foundations
of German law, in particular with the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the
German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

   - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts
to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German
courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may
reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are
necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to
the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions
based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior
to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses.
Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial
discovery process exists under German law.

We have been advised by Polish, Italian, French and English counsel that similar risks related to enforcing
judgments from a U.S. federal or state court exist in such jurisdictions, and we cannot assure you that such
risks do not and will not exist in other jurisdictions, including those in which the assets of some or all of our
subsidiaries that may guarantee the Notes in the future are located.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

Certain legal matters in connection with the Offering will be passed upon for us by Mayer Brown LLP, as to
matters of German law, and by Mayer Brown International LLP as to matters of U.S. federal law. Certain
legal matters in connection with the Offering will be passed upon for the Initial Purchasers by Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer Rechtsanwälte Steuerberater PartG mbB, as to matters of German law, and Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP as to matters of U.S. federal law.


-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021
and 2022, which were prepared on the basis of German GAAP and are included in this offering memorandum,
have been audited in accordance with Section 317 HGB (German Commercial Code) and German generally
accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V.) by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft
(“KPMG”), independent auditors, as stated in their auditor’s reports appearing herein. Each of the respective
auditor’s opinions of KPMG on the consolidated financial statements refers to the respective group
management report of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH. The group management reports are not reprinted in
this offering memorandum. The examination of, and the auditor’s opinion upon, such group management
reports are required under German auditing standards. This examination was not made in accordance with
generally accepted auditing or attestation standards in the United States. Accordingly, KPMG does not
express any opinion on this information or on the consolidated financial statements included in this offering
memorandum, in each case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards or U.S. attestation
standards.

**WEPA HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, ARNSBERG**

**UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023**

**General information regarding the condensed interim consolidated financial statements**

The consolidated financial statements of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, Arnsberg, for the financial year
ending 31 December 2022 were prepared in accordance with section 298 para. 1 in conjunction with
sections 242 et seq. and sections 264 et seq. of the German Commercial Code.

The condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the period from 01 January to 30 September 2023
were also prepared in accordance with these regulations. A statement of changes in fixed assets and the
disclosure of “thereof” amounts in the balance sheet and the income statement have been waived.

Some figures in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements contain rounded figures. The rounded
figures may result in discrepancies between the totals of the rounded figures and the totals that have also been
rounded.

**Disclosures on the scope of consolidation and consolidation methods**

With economic retroactive effect to 01.01.2023, Wepa Hygieneprodukte acquired all shares in Wepa
eCommerce GmbH (formerly SNYCE GmbH). The company is fully consolidated.

The inclusion of Wepa eCommerce GmbH has no significant impact on the comparability of the previous
year’s figures.

The consolidation methods are applied unchanged.

**Disclosures on accounting and valuation methods**

The same consolidation, valuation and accounting methods that applied to the 2022 audited consolidated
financial statements were applied to the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements for the
period ended September 30, 2023. A detailed description of these methods is contained in the notes to the
2022 audited consolidated financial statements.

In contrast to the consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2022, no actuarial
expert opinion was obtained for partial retirement provisions and pension provisions for the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements ended September 30, 2023.

Regarding the calculation of income taxes (respectively deferred taxes) the actual (respectively expected) tax
rates are applied.

**Information on material risks**

Europe continues to face major challenges with regard to the supply of energy and raw materials due to the
Russia-Ukraine war. Uncertainties remain due to high inflation and the associated reluctant consumer spend
to in the retail sector. The main risks for the WEPA Group for the period from 1 January to 30 September 2023
remain unchanged and have been described in the consolidated financial statements for the financial year
ended 31 December 2022. All developments are continuously monitored, evaluated and incorporated into our
business model as far as possible through appropriate measures.

Please refer to the risk report in the company’s Group management report as at 31 December 2022.

**Notes to individual balance sheet items**

**_Fixed assets_**

Total fixed assets decreased by EUR 5.8 million from EUR 772.9 million as at 31 December 2022 to
EUR 767.1 million as at 30 September 2023.

Intangible assets decreased by EUR 2.7 million due to amortisation of EUR 2.7 million and negative currency
effects of EUR 1.0 million. Goodwill increased by EUR 0.4 million due to the initial consolidation of Wepa
eCommerce GmbH.

**WEPA HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, ARNSBERG**

**UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023**

The decrease in property, plant and equipment by EUR 3.6 million from EUR 755.2 million as at
31 December 2022 to EUR 751.6 million as at 30 September 2023 is mainly due to the current higher
depreciation related to investments. Offsetting effects result from the expansion of the Kriebstein site with the
purchase of land and buildings as well as facilities for waste paper processing. Furthermore, significant
amounts were invested in paper processing plants and energy-efficient technologies in Germany and abroad.
Depreciation and amortisation in the current year amounted to EUR 43.0 million, with currency effects of
EUR 5.2 million having a positive impact.

Financial assets increased by EUR 0.6 million from EUR 1.2 million as at 31 December 2022 to
EUR 1.8 million as at 30 September 2023 due to some legally required long term loans in France.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories increased by a total of EUR 15.8 million from EUR 333.7 million as at 31 December 2022 to
EUR 349.4 million as at 30 September 2023. This is mainly due to an increase in raw materials and supplies of
EUR 24.0 million from EUR 169.5 million to EUR 193.5 million, while inventories of semi-finished goods
fell by EUR 8.2 million from EUR 73.0 million to EUR 64.8 million.

Overall, inventories continue to be characterized by the inflation of market prices and the associated impact
on inventory valuation.

The EUR 24.0 million increase in raw materials, consumables and supplies is in particular due to the deliberate
build-up of inventories in the pulp area at favorable spot prices. Our inventories are generally influenced by
short-term factors such as seasonal and inflation-related fluctuations in purchase prices for raw materials,
energy and other production factors as well as our own inventory management strategy (e.g. due to potential
availability problems) and that of our main customers on the one hand and long-term factors such as
fluctuations in sales volumes, expansion projects and our investment program on the other.

**_Trade receivables_**

Trade receivables increased by EUR 21.9 million from EUR 122.3 million as at 31 December 2022 to
EUR 144.2 million as at 30 September 2023. The volume of receivables sold as part of the ABS program was
deliberately reduced, which led to a corresponding increase in trade receivables (EUR 70.7 million). In
contrast, trade receivables from operating activities decreased by EUR 48.5 million compared to
31 December 2022, this corresponds to the lower overall sales in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the last
quarter of 2022.

**_Equity_**

The share capital remains unchanged at EUR 18.1 million.

Equity increased by EUR 114.5 million from EUR 279.2 million as at 31 December 2022 to EUR 393.6 million
as at 30 September 2023.

This increase resulted in particular from the current positive result for the period totaling EUR 123.4 million.
A dividend of EUR 12.7 million was paid out to shareholders in the current financial year.

The negative difference from currency translation decreased by EUR 3.7 million from EUR -15.8 million as at
31 December 2022 to EUR -12.1 million as at 30 September 2023. This amount results from the currency
translation of the individual financial statements included in the consolidation with a functional currency
other than EUR (UK and Poland) and was calculated in accordance with section 308a German Commercial
Code.

**_Difference from capital consolidation_**

The difference from capital consolidation decreased by EUR 1.6 million from EUR 18.3 million as at
31 December 2022 to EUR 16.7 million as at 30 September 2023. The negative goodwill from capital
consolidation as at 31 December 2022 was released to schedule.

**UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023**

**_Provisions_**

Provisions increased by EUR 37.0 million from EUR 135.5 million as at 31 December 2022 to
EUR 172.5 million as at 30 September 2023. EUR 22.6 million of this increase is attributable to the increase
in tax provisions due to the improved result.

Other provisions increased by EUR 14.5 million, mainly due to the increase in impending losses for pending
transactions and for personnel and energy costs, while they declined in other areas.

Provisions are recognised for all identifiable risks and contingent liabilities. They were valued at the amount
required according to prudent business judgement.

**_Bonds and liabilities to banks_**

Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH has issued two bonds (Senior Secured Notes) in a total amount of
EUR 600,000 thousand. One note of EUR 400,000 thousand with a term until 2027 and a fixed interest
coupon of 2.875% and one note of EUR 200,000 thousand with a term until 2026 and a variable interest
coupon of 3-month EURIBOR plus 2.875%.

Liabilities to banks increased by EUR 0.9 million from EUR 0.8 million as at 31 December 2022 to
EUR 1.7 million as at 30 September 2023. This mainly relates to the liabilities of a subsidiary that was not
previously included in cash pooling.

The working capital credit line (RCF) with a volume of EUR 150,000 thousand has a term until
December 2026. EUR 3.6 million of this working capital credit line had been drawn down as at 30 June 2023
for sureties and guarantees. In addition, a guarantee for EUR 6.6 million was still in place with another bank
as at the reporting date.

**Notes to individual items in the income statement**

**_Sales revenues_**

Sales revenues increased by EUR 228.7 million (+19.8%) from EUR 1,153.3 million in the first nine months
to 30 September 2022 to EUR 1,382.0 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023. This sales
growth is mainly due to the increase in our sales prices in response to the sharp rise in purchase prices for our
raw materials and energy.

The total volume of finished goods sold increased by 16,543 tons (3.2%) from 523,972 tons in the first
nine months to 30 September 2022 to 540,516 tons in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

Sales of parent rolls decreased by 1,001 tons (-4.4%) from 22,942 tons in the first nine months to
30 September 2022 to 21,941 tons in the first nine months to 30 September 2023. Sales of de-inked paper
decreased by 13,181 tons (-32.3%) from 40,806 tons in the first nine months to 30 September 2022 to 27,625
tons in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income decreased by EUR 2.0 million from EUR 17.5 million in the first nine months to
30 September 2022 to EUR 15.5 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

This is mainly due to the decrease of the income from currency exchange rates by EUR 9.5 million (from
EUR 12.1 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2022 to EUR 2.6 million in the first nine months
to 30 September 2023).

The release of provisions increased by EUR 4.5 million (from EUR 0.1 million in the first nine months to
30 September 2022 to EUR 4.6 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023) and the income relating
to other periods increased by EUR 2.0 million from EUR 2.8 million in the first nine months to
30 September 2022 to EUR 4.8 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

**UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023**

**_Cost of materials_**

The cost of materials decreased by EUR 23.5 million (-2.9%) from EUR 800.0 million in the first nine months
to 30 September 2022 to EUR 776.5 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

This reduction is mainly due to the reduction in purchase prices, particularly for waste paper and energy and
also other materials, some of which had become massively more expensive in previous periods.

The reduction of EUR 4.6 million or -0.8% in the cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies is
disproportionately attributable to waste paper costs (reduction of 29.0%). The value of purchases of
merchandise and parent rolls also decreased.

There was an opposite trend in the pulp area, where there was an increase of 9.9% due to further price
increases compared to the same period in the previous year.

Services purchased decreased by EUR 18.9 million (-8.1%) from EUR 232.5 million in the first nine months
to 30 September 2022 to EUR 213.7 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023. This includes a
reduction in energy costs of 13.3% or EUR 26.6 million from EUR 199.3 million in the first nine months to
30 September 2022 to EUR 172.7 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

In relation to total operating performance, the cost of materials decreased from 66.3% in the first nine months
to 30 September 2022 to 56.4% in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

**_Personnel expense_**

Personnel expenses increased by EUR 20.9 million from EUR 170.8 million in the first nine months to
30 September 2022 to EUR 191.7 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023, of which
EUR 17.2 million is attributable to wages and salaries and EUR 3.6 million to the corresponding social
security contributions.

The higher personnel costs are caused by a moderate further increase in personnel as well as increases in tariff
and non-tariff wages and salaries.

The average number of employees increased from 3,775 employees in the first nine months to
30 September 2022 to 3,877 employees in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation and amortisation increased by EUR 1.6 million from EUR 44.0 million in the first nine months
to 30 September 2022 to EUR 45.6 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023. This included
impairment losses of EUR 0.8 million in the current year, compared to EUR 0.4 million in the previous year.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses decreased by EUR 2.7 million from EUR 190.5 million in the first nine months to
30 September 2022 to EUR 187.8 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.

Expenses from currency exchange rates decreased by EUR 11.2 million from EUR 14.5 million in the first
nine months to 30 September 2022 to EUR 3.3 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023 and
expenses relating to other periods decreased by EUR 1.5 million from EUR 4.3 million in the first nine months
to 30 September 2022 to EUR 2.8 million by 30 September 2023.

In contrast, other expenses from operating activities increased by EUR 8.8 million from EUR 55.1 million in
the first nine months to 30 September 2022 to EUR 63.9 million in the first nine months to 30 September 2023.
These include various expenses such as increased expenses for IT licences, legal and consulting costs and the
costs of celebrating the Wepa Group’s 75th anniversary.

**—English Translation of the German Original—**


-----

The following auditor’s report, prepared in accordance with § 322 HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German
Commercial Code”], refers to the complete consolidated financial statements, comprising the consolidated
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows, together with the group management report of the Wepa
Hygieneprodukte GmbH for the financial year from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. The group
management report is not included in this prospectus. The above-mentioned auditor’s report and consolidated
financial statements are both translations of the respective German-language documents.

**Independent Auditor’s Report**

To Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, Arnsberg

**Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, Arnsberg and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31,
2022, the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, and
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented
therein. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH for the
financial year from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and
financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2022, and of its financial performance for the financial
year from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 in compliance with German Legally Required
Accounting Principles, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], we declare that
our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial
statements and of the group management report.

**Basis for the Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for
Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the
“Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report”section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance
with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report**

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all
material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and that the consolidated financial
statements, in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is
responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting
Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related


-----

to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of
accounting provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a
whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements
and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management
report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient
appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management**
**Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management
report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with
the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development,
as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and
on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)
will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management
report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the
group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal controls.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements
and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of
estimates made by management and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause
the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express [audit] opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our [audit] opinions.


-----

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the
significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the
proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate
opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

of initial consolidation in accordance with § 301 Para. 1 HGB. The recognisable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries are recognised at their fair values, irrespective of the amount of the
minority interest.

Hidden reserves and charges in existence at the time of the initial consolidation are disclosed and accounted
for in accordance with the underlying assets and liabilities.

Remaining differences on the assets side (goodwill) are capitalised and depreciated according to schedule
pursuant to § 309 Para. 1 in conjunction with § 253 Para. 3 S. 4 HGB over 10 years or, if necessary, written
down on an unscheduled basis. Any remaining negative goodwill is treated in accordance with § 309 Para.
2 HGB or German Accounting Standard.

Shares in non-consolidated companies are valued at the lower of cost or fair value.

Intercompany profits, sales, expenses and income as well as all receivables and liabilities between the
consolidated companies are eliminated.

The translation of the annual financial statements of the consolidated companies prepared in foreign
currencies is carried out on the basis of § 308a HGB.

Accordingly, in the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of these companies are
translated at the closing rate, equity items are translated at historical rates, and expenses and income are
translated at the average rate for the year. Resulting translation differences are recognised directly in equity
under the item equity difference from currency translation. Changes in the exchange rates of intercompany
receivables and liabilities are generally recognised directly in equity.

**Disclosures regarding accounting and valuation methods**

The following accounting and valuation methods are authoritative for the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements:

**Intangible assets acquired for a consideration are capitalised at acquisition cost and, if they are subject to**
wear and tear, reduced by scheduled straight-line amortisation in accordance with their useful life.

The scheduled amortisation of goodwill from capital consolidation is carried out in accordance with
§ 309 Para. 1 in conjunction with § 253 Para. 3 S.3 HGB on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years.
Current developments are taken into account—if necessary—through unscheduled depreciation.

**Property, plant and equipment are valued at acquisition cost, taking into account scheduled depreciation. In**
the event of permanent impairment, unscheduled depreciation is taken into account. Scheduled depreciation
on fixed assets is exclusively carried out according to the straight-line method.

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2022 (Continued)**

**Financial assets are valued at acquisition cost. If the value to be attributed to the financial assets on the**
balance sheet date is expected to be permanently below the acquisition cost, this is recognised.

**Raw materials, consumables and supplies as well as merchandise are valued at acquisition cost in compliance**
with the strict principle of the lower of cost or market.

**Unfinished goods are recognised at production cost, which includes direct production and material costs as**
well as appropriate portions of production, material and administrative overheads and depreciation. Interest
on borrowed capital is not included in the production costs.

**Finished goods are predominantly determined by calculating the production costs; some companies value the**
production costs using the retrograde method. In addition to direct production and material costs, the
calculation of production costs also includes appropriate portions of production, material and administrative
overheads as well as depreciation. Interest on borrowed capital is not included in the manufacturing costs.
The valuation of production costs according to the retrograde method is carried out by deducting the sales
and distribution overheads still to be incurred as well as the profit margin from the sales price after sales
deductions.

In the current financial year, the production cost for the German companies was calculated for the first time
in order to improve the insight into the net assets, financial position and results of operations. This led to a
significant reduction in the valuation.

**Inventory risks are taken into account by applying appropriate valuation discounts.**

**Receivables and other assets are valued at nominal value or at the lower fair value on the balance sheet date.**
Appropriate individual value adjustments are made for receivables that are at risk due to individual risks; the
general credit risk is taken into account by means of lumpsum deductions. Receivables in foreign currencies
with a remaining term of less than one year are translated at the average spot exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Receivables in foreign currency with a remaining term of more than one year are recognised at the
lower of cost or the value resulting from the valuation at the average spot exchange rate on the balance sheet
date.

Trade receivables are sold by WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH and various subsidiaries as part of ABS
transactions, with the credit risk being transferred to the buyer. The trade receivables are reported at a
correspondingly reduced level. The administration of the receivables is taken over for the buyer by WEPA
Hygieneprodukte GmbH or the respective subsidiary.

The share capital is fully paid in and is shown at nominal value.

The pension provisions for vested rights and current pension obligations are calculated according to the
projected unit credit method using the “2018 G mortality tables” (Generationsrichttafeln) by Prof. Dr Klaus
Heubeck. The calculation was made in accordance with § 253 Para. 1 S. 2 HGB, § 253 Para. 2 HGB.

The average market interest rate of the past 10 years with a remaining term of 15 years of 1.78% (previous
year: 1.89%) was used for discounting in accordance with the Ordinance on the Discounting of Provisions of
18 November 2009. A calculation using the average market interest rate of the past 7 financial years would
result in a pension provision that is kEUR 40.0 higher.

Expected salary increases were taken into account at 2.0 % (previous year: 2.0 %) and pension increases at
2.0 % (previous year: 2.0 %). As in the previous year, no fluctuation was taken into account. Expenses or
income resulting from changes in the discount rate are reported in the financial result.

The long-term obligations of the foreign companies towards their employees were calculated according to the
country-specific conditions in analogous application of the provisions of the German Commercial Code. The
corresponding obligations are reported under other provisions.

**Tax provisions and other provisions are made for all identifiable risks and uncertain liabilities. They are**
recognised at the settlement amount required according to reasonable commercial judgement, taking into
account price and cost increases. Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted at
the average market interest rate of the past seven financial years corresponding to their remaining term.

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2022 (Continued)**

**Liabilities are recognised at the settlement amount. Liabilities in foreign currency with a remaining term of**
less than one year are translated at the average spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Liabilities in
foreign currencies with a remaining term of more than one year are recognised on the balance sheet date at the
higher of the acquisition cost or the value resulting from the valuation at the average spot exchange rate.

For the calculation of deferred taxes due to temporary or quasi-permanent differences between Consolidated

April 18, 2023 the commercial law valuations of assets and liabilities and their tax valuation or due to tax loss
carryforwards and tax credits, the amounts of the tax burdens and tax relief expected to arise in the future are
valued at the company-specific tax rates at the time of the expected elimination of the differences and are not
discounted.

As at 31 December 2022, the deferred tax assets and liabilities from the individual financial statements and
from consolidation measures were netted as in the previous year and the excess was reported as deferred tax
liabilities.

**Notes to individual balance sheet items**

**Fixed assets**

The development of the individual fixed asset items, including depreciation and amortisation for the financial
year, is shown in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (Appendix 1 to the notes to the
consolidated financial statements).

**Goodwill**

Goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis in the current financial year. In addition, an unscheduled
amortisation of the goodwill of WEPA Category Solutions GmbH in the amount of kEUR 1,662 was made.

**Receivables and other assets**

As in the previous year, the receivables have a remaining term of less than one year.

**Equity**

The share capital of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH amounts to kEUR 18,100.00.

The net loss of the previous year was fully offset against retained earnings.

Equity contains a negative difference from currency translation of kEUR 15,834. This amount was calculated
in accordance with § 308a HGB and results, on the one hand, from the currency translation of the individual
financial statements included in the consolidation that are prepared in currencies other than the Group
currency, the EUR (PLN and GBP), and, on the other hand, from changes in the exchange rates of
intercompany long-term loans of kEUR -3,862, which are recognised in equity.

Taking into account the existing statutory distribution restrictions of kEUR 8,948, an amount of
kEUR 127,057 is available to the shareholders of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH as distribution potential.
Consolidated Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year 2022 16/64 Finance Department WEPA

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2022 (Continued)**

The calculation was based on individual company tax rates between 19% and 32%.

The capitalised deferred taxes from loss carryforwards and tax credits were determined from the tax planning
calculations, taking into account a planning period of five years.

**Collateral**

Since December 2019/January 2020, WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH has been financed by two bonds with a
total amount of kEUR 600,000. One bond with a volume of kEUR 400,000 with a term until 2027 and a fixed
interest coupon of 2.875% and one bond with a volume of kEUR 200,000 with a term until 2026 and a
variable interest coupon 3-month EURIBOR plus 2.875%.

In addition, there is a working capital credit line (RCF) of kEUR 150,000 with a term until December 2026.

The following collateral was provided for these liabilities, which is managed by Commerzbank AG as “security
agent”:

Land charges encumbering the real estate of WEPA Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, pledging of some shares
in significant Group companies and assignment as security of fixed assets of WEPA Deutschland GmbH &
Co. KG and WEPA UK Ltd.

(Appendix 1 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Depreciation includes unscheduled
depreciation of kEUR 2,275 (previous year: kEUR 2,930).

Expenses from currency translation increased compared to the previous year to EUR 15,450,000 (previous
year: EUR 3,482,000), primarily from PLN and GBP and include realised currency losses as well as unrealised
currency losses from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet items into the respective local currency.

Other operating expenses include extraordinary expenses totalling EUR 3,824,000 for the defence against a
cyber attack as well as for the refinancing of the working capital credit line (RCF) and the receivables-based
financing (ABS) in 2022.

**Interest and similar expenses**

The compounding of provisions results in an interest expense of EUR 80,000 (previous year: kEUR 217).

**Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations**

**Contingent liabilities**

As at the balance sheet date, the following contingent liabilities from guarantees exist:

There is a maximum amount guarantee totalling kEUR 2,475 for certain loan liabilities of WEPA Kraftwerk
GmbH, Arnsberg. The loan was valued at kEUR 248 on the balance sheet date.

In addition, there are guarantees totalling kEUR 6,632 for energy supply contracts. Furthermore, there are
sureties and guarantees totalling kEUR 3,661, mostly for energy supply contracts in Italy under the revolving
credit facility, for which all major Group companies are liable.

We consider the risk of a possible claim to be low due to the liquidity of the main debtors.

**Other financial obligations**

The total amount of other financial obligations (obligations from rental and lease agreements as well as from
leases) is kEUR 29,558 as at 31 December 2022 (previous year: kEUR 25,692).

A total of kEUR 11,689 is due within one year.

The order commitment as of 31 December 2022 is within the normal range for the industry.

**Off-balance sheet transactions**

The WEPA Group has a receivables-based financing (ABS structure). This was restructured in the 2022
financial year. The term was extended until June 2027 (previously: until June 2023) and the financing volume
was increased to up to EUR 220.0 million (previously: up to EUR 150.0 million). The ABS financing is
available to WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH and various subsidiaries and was utilised by all companies in the
amount of EUR 216.0 million (previous year: EUR 130.0 million) on the balance sheet date.

As the Wepa Group no longer bears any credit risks from the sold receivables and these have been transferred
in full to the financing bank, economic ownership has been transferred and the receivables have been
derecognised by the Wepa Group. Apart from the intended inflow of liquidity, this procedure leads to a
reduction in trade receivables and—due to the use of the additional liquidity for the repayment of short-term
liabilities—a reduction of the balance sheet total.


-----

**WEPA HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, ARNSBERG**

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2022 (Continued)**

In addition, a subsidiary of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH has another receivables-based financing
arrangement (factoring) with a term until 31 December 2023 and a financing volume of up to EUR 15 million.
As of the balance sheet date, EUR 6.6 million of the financing had been drawn down.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity procurement
risks from booked, pending and planned underlying transactions. Hedging is carried out exclusively in the
name and for the account of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH.

The booked and pending underlying transactions can be combined with the hedging transactions within the
framework of micro and portfolio hedging to form HGB valuation units, separated according to commodity,
foreign exchange and interest rate hedging instruments. The HGB valuation units are valued individually as at
the balance sheet date.

The valuation methods and assumptions underlying the determination of the fair value are as follows:

Forward exchange transactions and swaps are valued at the forward rate on the balance sheet date. Options
are valued according to their design using Black-Scholes models or modifications thereof. Instruments to
hedge currency, interest rate and commodity risks are valued by discounting the future cash flows. Discounting
is based on market interest rates over the remaining term of the instruments. The exchange amounts from
these hedging instruments are recognised in profit or loss at the time of payment or accrual on the reporting
date.

According to valuation principles under German commercial law, a negative valuation result of the respective
hedging transaction leads to the formation of a provision for anticipated losses from pending transactions,
insofar as no effective valuation unit was initially formed, while a positive valuation result is not taken into
account.

The WEPA Group strives to achieve a balanced risk/reward ratio. Therefore, depending on the assessment of
the market situation, the total requirement for currencies or financing volume is generally hedged in a range
between 50% and 90% over the course of a year in order to be able to react to unpredictable developments in
interest rates and currencies when calculating prices. In the case of raw materials, purchase prices are hedged
via commodity swaps; here, too, depending on the market situation, hedging is aimed for, which generally
ranges from 30% to 90% over the course of a year. The primary objective remains to hedge the calculation
rates on which the planning is based.

-2,238

MT: metric tons

Provisions of kEUR 11,787 (previous year: kEUR 2,151) were made for negative market values of derivatives.
The nominal amounts of the derivative financial transactions are based on the purchase or sale amounts or
the contract values of the hedged underlying transactions.

If there is a direct hedging relationship, the derivative financial instruments can be combined as a valuation
unit with an underlying transaction or the planned transaction. The WEPA Group uses the so-called freezing
method for the accounting of valuation units.

For the derivatives concluded by WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH, the volumes listed below were combined
into valuation units with the underlying transactions.

Due to the fact that most of the design features of the designated underlying transactions and hedging
instruments in a valuation unit match, the changes in value of the cash flows largely balance each other out.
The hedge is in place for the entire term of the underlying transaction.

Other assets include options in the amount of kEUR 1,535.

**Disclosures regarding the cash flow statement**

Cash and cash equivalents are defined in accordance with German Accounting Standard 21 (GAS 21) as
cash on hand, bank balances and cheques due within three months (kEUR 16,550) less liabilities to banks due
at any time and other short-term borrowings that are part of the disposition of cash and cash equivalents
(kEUR 525).

**Consolidated financial statements**
**for the financial year from**
**January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021**

**—English Translation of the German Original—**


-----

The following auditor’s report, prepared in accordance with § 322 HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German
Commercial Code”], refers to the complete consolidated financial statements, comprising the consolidated
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows, together with the group management report of the Wepa
Hygieneprodukte GmbH for the financial year from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. The group
management report is not included in this prospectus. The above-mentioned auditor’s report and consolidated
financial statements are both translations of the respective German-language documents.

**Independent Auditor’s Report**

To Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, Arnsberg

**Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, Arnsberg and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31,
2021, the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, and
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented
therein. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH for the
financial year from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and
financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2021, and of its financial performance for the financial
year from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 in compliance with German Legally Required
Accounting Principles, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], we declare that
our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial
statements and of the group management report.

**Basis for the Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for
Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the
“Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report”section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance
with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report**

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all
material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and that the consolidated financial
statements, in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is
responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting
Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related


-----

to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of
accounting provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a
whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements
and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management
report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient
appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management**
**Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management
report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with
the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development,
as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and
on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)
will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management
report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the
group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal controls.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements
and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of
estimates made by management and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause
the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express [audit] opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our [audit] opinions.


-----

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the
significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the
proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate
opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

As of 28 June 2021, WEPA Deutschland GmbH & Co KG acquired all shares in Nosean
Grunstücksverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH.

**Share of**
**Name and location of the company** **capital in %**
Viaregia Sp.z.oo., Otmuchow, Poland . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24.76

There is an investment of 24.76% in Viaregia Sp. z oo., Otmuchow, Poland. The equity of the company as at
31 December 2020 amounts to EUR -559,000 (closing rate on 31 December 2021: PLN 4.5969/EUR), the net
loss for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020 amounts to EUR -107,000 (average rate in
2021: PLN 4.57202/EUR). The company is not included in the consolidated financial statements using the
at-equity method due to its minor importance.

**Disclosures regarding consolidation methods**

The financial statements of the individual companies are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting
and valuation principles for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.

Capital consolidation is carried out according to the revaluation method by offsetting the acquisition costs of
the participation against the Group’s share in the revalued equity of the consolidated subsidiaries at the time
of initial consolidation in accordance with § 301 (1) of the German Commercial Code. The recognisable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries are recognised at their fair values, irrespective of
the amount of the minority interest.

Hidden reserves and liabilities existing at the time of initial consolidation are disclosed and ccounted for in
accordance with the underlying assets and liabilities.

Remaining differences on the assets side (goodwill) are capitalised and depreciated according to schedule
pursuant to § 309 para. 1 in conjunction with § 253 para. 3 sentence 4 of the German Commercial Code over
10 years or, if necessary, written down on an unscheduled basis. Any remaining negative goodwill is treated in
accordance with § 309 para. 2 of the German Commercial Code or German Accounting Standard 4,
respectively.

Shares in non-consolidated companies are valued at the lower of cost or fair value.

Intercompany profits, sales, expenses and income as well as all receivables and liabilities between the
consolidated companies are eliminated.

The translation of the annual financial statements of the consolidated companies prepared in foreign
currencies is carried out on the basis of § 308a of the German Commercial Code.

Accordingly, in the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of these companies are
translated at the closing rate, equity items are translated at historical rates, and expenses and income are
translated at the average rate for the year. Resulting translation differences are recognised directly in equity
under the item equity difference from currency translation. Changes in the exchange rates of intercompany
receivables and liabilities are generally recognised directly in equity.

**Disclosures on accounting and valuation methods**

The financial statements of the individual companies are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting
and valuation principles for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.

**Intangible assets acquired against payment are capitalised at acquisition cost and, if they are subject to wear**
and tear, reduced by scheduled amortisation in accordance with their useful life.

The scheduled amortisation of goodwill from capital consolidation is carried out in accordance with § 309
Para. 1 in conjunction with § 253 Para. 3 sentence 3 of the German Commercial Code on a straight-line basis
over a period of 10 years. Current developments are taken into account—if necessary—through unscheduled
depreciation.

**Tangible assets are valued at acquisition cost, taking into account scheduled depreciation. In the event of**
permanent impairment, unscheduled depreciation is taken into account. Scheduled depreciation on fixed
assets is exclusively carried out according to the straight-line method.

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 (Continued)**

**Financial assets are valued at acquisition cost. If the value to be attributed to the financial assets on the**
balance sheet date is permanently below the acquisition cost, this is recognised.

**Raw materials and supplies as well as merchandise are valued at acquisition cost in compliance with the strict**
principle of the lower of cost or market.

**Unfinished goods are recognised at production cost, which includes direct production and material costs as**
well as an appropriate share of production, material and administrative overheads. Interest on borrowed
capital is not included in the production costs.

**Finished goods are valued according to the retrograde method by deducting the sales and distribution**
overheads still to be incurred as well as the profit margin from the sales price after sales deductions.

**Inventory risks are taken into account by considering appropriate valuation discounts.**

**Receivables and other assets are valued at nominal value or at the lower fair value on the balance sheet date.**
Appropriate individual value adjustments are made for receivables that are at risk due to individual risks; the
general credit risk is taken into account by means of lumpsum deductions. Receivables in foreign currencies
with a remaining term of less than one year are translated at the average spot exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Receivables in foreign currency with a remaining term of more than one year are recognised at the
lower of cost or the value resulting from the valuation at the average spot exchange rate on the balance sheet
date.

Trade receivables are sold by WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH and various subsidiaries as part of ABS
transactions, with the credit risk being transferred to the buyer. The trade receivables are reported at a
correspondingly reduced level. The administration of the receivables is taken over for the buyer by WEPA
Hygieneprodukte GmbH or the respective subsidiary.

The share capital is fully paid in and is shown at nominal value.

The pension provisions for vested rights and current pension obligations are calculated according to the
projected unit credit method using the “2018 G mortality tables” (Generationsrichttafeln) by Prof. Dr. Klaus
Heubeck. The calculation was made in accordance with § 253 para. 1 sentence 2 of the German Commercial
Code, § 253 para. 2 of the German Commercial Code.

The average market interest rate of the past 10 years with a remaining term of 15 years of 1.89% (previous
year: 2.32%) was used for discounting in accordance with the Ordinance on the Discounting of Provisions of
18 November 2009. A calculation using the average market interest rate of the past 7 financial years would
result in a pension provision that is EUR 80,000 higher.

Expected salary increases were taken into account at 2.0% (previous year: 2.0%) and pension increases at 2.0%
(previous year: 2.0%). As in the previous year, no fluctuation was taken into account. Expenses or income
resulting from changes in the discount rate are reported in the financial result.

The assets that serve exclusively to fulfil the pension obligations and are not accessible to all other creditors
(plan assets) are offset against the provisions at their fair value.

The long-term obligations of the foreign companies towards their employees were calculated according to the
country-specific conditions in analogous application of the provisions of commercial law. The corresponding
obligations are reported under other provisions.

**Tax provisions and other provisions are made for all identifiable risks and uncertain liabilities. They are**
recognised at the settlement amount required according to reasonable commercial judgement, taking into
account price and cost increases. Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted at
the average market interest rate of the past seven financial years corresponding to their remaining term.

**Liabilities are recognised at the settlement amount. Liabilities in foreign currency with a remaining term of**
less than one year are translated at the average spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Liabilities in
foreign currencies with a remaining term of more than one year are recognised on the balance sheet date at the
higher of the acquisition cost or the value resulting from the valuation at the average spot exchange rate.

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 (Continued)**

For the calculation of deferred taxes due to temporary or quasi-permanent differences between the commercial
law valuations of assets and liabilities and their tax valuations or due to tax loss carry forwards and tax
credits, the amounts of the tax burdens and tax relief expected to arise in the future are valued at the
company-specific tax rates at the time of the expected elimination of the differences and are not discounted.

As at 31 December 2021, the deferred tax assets and liabilities from the individual financial statements and
from consolidation measures were netted as in the previous year and the excess was reported as deferred tax
liabilities.

**Notes to individual balance sheet items**

**Fixed assets**

The development of the individual fixed asset items, including depreciation and amortisation for the financial
year, is shown in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (Attachment 1 to the notes to the

**Goodwill**

Goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis in the current financial year.

As in the previous year, the receivables have a remaining term of less than one year.

Receivables from shareholders also relate to affiliated companies.

**Equity**

The share capital of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH amounts to kEUR 18,100. In the financial year, a
dividend of kEUR 18,146 was distributed to the shareholder using the previous year’s net profit. The
remaining net profit of the previous year in the amount of kEUR 26,827 was carried forward.

Equity includes a negative difference from currency translation of kEUR 7,959. This amount was calculated
in accordance with § 308a of the German Commercial Code and results from the currency translation of the
individual financial statements included in the consolidation that are prepared in currencies other than the
Group currency, the EUR (PLN and GBP).

Taking into account the existing statutory distribution restrictions of kEUR 2,055, an amount of
kEUR 130,391 is available to the shareholders of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH as distribution potential.

The total development of equity is shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity.

The management of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH proposes to carry forward the net profit of the current
fiscal year of the company in the amount of EUR 10.1 million.

optimisations in Italy and the refinancing carried out in January 2020.

**Interest and similar expenses**

The compounding of provisions results in an interest expense of kEUR 217 (previous year: kEUR 269).

**Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations**

**Contingent liabilities**

As at the balance sheet date, the following contingent liabilities from guarantees exist:

There is a maximum amount guarantee totalling kEUR 2,475 for certain loan liabilities of WEPA Kraftwerk
GmbH, Arnsberg. The loan was valued at kEUR 495 on the balance sheet date. In addition, there are sureties
and guarantees with a total volume of kEUR 3,670 under the revolving credit facility, for which all major
Group companies are liable.

We assess the risk of a possible drawdown as not probable due to the liquidity position of the main debtors.

**Other financial obligations**

The total amount of other financial obligations (obligations from rental and lease agreements as well as from
leases) is kEUR 25,692 as at 31 December 2021 (previous year: kEUR 29,048).

A total of kEUR 10,589 is due within one year.

The order commitment as of 31 December 2021 is within the normal range for the industry.

**Off-balance sheet transactions**

The WEPA Group has receivables-based financing (ABS structure) with a term until June 2023 and a
financing volume of up to EUR 180.0 million. The ABS financing is available to WEPA Hygieneprodukte
GmbH and various subsidiaries and was utilised by all companies in the amount of EUR 130.0 million
(previous year: EUR 60.0 million) on the balance sheet date.

In addition, a subsidiary of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH has another receivables-based financing
arrangement (factoring) with a term until 31 December 2022 and a financing volume of up to EUR 20 million.
The financing is used in the amount of EUR 8.4 million.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity procurement
risks from booked, pending and planned underlying transactions. Hedging is carried out exclusively in the
name and for the account of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH.

The booked and pending underlying transactions can be combined with the hedging transactions within the
framework of micro and portfolio hedging to form German Commercial Code valuation units, separated


-----

**WEPA HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, ARNSBERG**

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 (Continued)**

according to commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging instruments. The German Commercial
Code valuation units are valued individually as at the balance sheet date.

The valuation methods and assumptions underlying the determination of the fair value are as follows:

Forward exchange transactions and swaps are valued at the forward rate on the balance sheet date. Options
are valued according to their design using Black-Scholes models or modifications thereof. Instruments to
hedge currency, interest rate and commodity risks are valued by discounting the future cash flows. Discounting
is based on market interest rates over the remaining term of the instruments. The exchange amounts from
these hedging instruments are recognised in profit or loss at the time of payment or accrual on the reporting
date.

According to valuation principles under commercial law, a negative valuation result of the respective hedging
transaction leads to the recognition of a provision for anticipated losses from pending transactions, insofar as
no effective valuation unit was initially formed, while a positive valuation result is not taken into account.

The WEPA Group strives to achieve a balanced risk / opportunity ratio. Therefore, depending on the
assessment of the market situation, the total requirement for currencies or financing volume over the course
of a year is generally hedged in a range between 50% and 90% in order to be able to react to unexpected
developments in interest rates and currencies when calculating prices. In the case of raw materials, purchase
prices are hedged via commodity swaps; here too, depending on the market situation, hedging is aimed for,
which generally ranges from 30% to 90% over the course of a year. The primary objective remains to hedge
the calculation rates on which the planning is based.

The following derivative financial positions existed as at the balance sheet date:

-429

MT: metric tons

Provisions of kEUR 2,151 (previous year: kEUR 17,644) are made for negative market values of derivatives.
The nominal amounts of the derivative financial transactions correspond to the purchase or sale amounts or
the contract values of the hedged underlying transactions.

If there is a direct hedging relationship, the derivative financial instruments can be combined as a valuation
unit with an underlying transaction or the planned transaction. The WEPA Group chooses the so-called
freezing method for the balance sheet presentation of valuation units.

For the currency and commodity derivatives concluded by WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH, the volumes
listed below were combined into valuation units with the underlying transactions.

Due to the fact that most of the design features of the designated underlying transactions and hedging
instruments in a valuation unit match, the changes in value of the cash flows largely balance each other out.
The hedge is in place for the entire term of the underlying transaction.

Other assets include options in the amount of kEUR 2,609.

**Disclosures regarding the cash flow statement**

Cash and cash equivalents are defined in accordance with German Accounting Standard 21 (GAS 21) as cash
on hand, bank balances and cheques due within three months (kEUR 27,381) less liabilities to banks due at
any time and other short-term borrowings that are part of the disposition of cash and cash equivalents
(kEUR 466).

**Consolidated financial statements**
**for the financial year from**
**January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020**

**—English Translation of the German Original—**


-----

The following auditor’s report, prepared in accordance with § 322 HGB [“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German
Commercial Code”], refers to the complete consolidated financial statements, comprising the consolidated
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows, together with the group management report of the Wepa
Hygieneprodukte GmbH for the financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The group
management report is not included in this prospectus. The above-mentioned auditor’s report and consolidated
financial statements are both translations of the respective German-language documents.

**Independent Auditor’s Report**

To Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, Arnsberg

**Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH, Arnsberg and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31,
2020, the consolidated statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, and
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented
therein. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH for the
financial year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and
financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance for the financial
year from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 in compliance with German Legally Required
Accounting Principles, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], we declare that
our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial
statements and of the group management report.

**Basis for the Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for
Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the
“Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report”section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance
with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report**

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all
material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and that the consolidated financial
statements, in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is
responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting
Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related


-----

to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of
accounting provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a
whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements
and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management
report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient
appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management**
**Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management
report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with
the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development,
as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and
on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)
will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management
report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the
group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal controls.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements
and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of
estimates made by management and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause
the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express [audit] opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our [audit] opinions.


-----

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the
significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the
proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate
opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

**WEPA HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, ARNSBERG**

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 (Continued)**

In the current financial year, Wepa Produktion GmbH & Co. KG was renamed Wepa Deutschland
GmbH & Co. KG.

The following companies were not included in the consolidated financial statements by way of full
consolidation due to their minor significance for the net assets, financial position and results of operations of
the Group:

**Share in**
**Name and registered office of the company** **capital in %**
Wepa Deutschland Verwaltungs-GmbH, Arnsberg . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100
Wepa Reserve GmbH, Arnsberg . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100

Wepa Produktion Verwaltungs GmbH was renamed Wepa Deutschland Verwaltungs-GmbH and Wepa
Deutschland GmbH was renamed Wepa Reserve GmbH in the current financial year.

There is an investment of 24.76% in Viaregia Sp. z.o.o., Otmuchow, Poland. The company’s equity as at
31 December 2019 amounts to kEUR -456 (closing rate on 31 December 2019: PLN 4.5597/EUR), and the
net loss for the financial year from 01 January to 31 December 2019 amounts to kEUR -30 (average rate for
2019: PLN 4.4430/EUR). The company is not included in the consolidated financial statements using the
at-equity method due to its minor importance.

**Disclosures regarding consolidation methods**

The financial statements of the individual companies are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting
and valuation principles for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.

Capital consolidation is carried out according to the revaluation method by offsetting the acquisition costs of
the participation against the Group’s share in the revalued equity of the consolidated subsidiaries at the time
of initial consolidation in accordance with § 301 (1) of the German Commercial Code. The recognisable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries are recognised at their fair values, irrespective of
the amount of the minority interest.

Hidden reserves and charges existing at the time of initial consolidation are disclosed and accounted for in
accordance with the underlying assets and liabilities.

Remaining differences on the assets side (goodwill) are capitalised and depreciated according to schedule
pursuant to § 309 para. 1 in conjunction with § 253 para. 3 sentence 4 of the German Commercial Code over
10 years or, if necessary, written down on an unscheduled basis. Any remaining negative goodwill is treated in
accordance with § 309 para. 2 of the German Commercial Code and German Accounting Standards
4 respectively.

Shares in non-consolidated companies are valued at cost of purchase or at less fair value.

Intercompany profits, sales, expenses and income as well as all receivables and liabilities between the
consolidated companies are eliminated.

The currency conversion of the annual financial statements of the consolidated companies denominated in
foreign currencies is carried out on the basis of § 308a of the German Commercial Code.

Accordingly, in the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of these companies are
translated at the closing rate, equity items are translated at historical rates, and expenses and income are
translated at the average rate for the year. Resulting translation differences are recognised directly in equity
under the item difference in equity from currency translation. Changes in the exchange rates of intercompany
receivables and liabilities are generally recognised directly in equity as a matter of principle.

**Disclosures on accounting and valuation methods**

The following accounting and valuation methods are authoritative for the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements.

**Intangible assets acquired against payment are capitalised at acquisition cost and, if they are subject to wear**
and tear, reduced by scheduled amortisation in accordance with their useful life.


-----

**WEPA HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, ARNSBERG**

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 (Continued)**

The scheduled amortisation of goodwill from capital consolidation is carried out in accordance with
§ 309 Para. 1 in conjunction with § 253 Para. 3 sentence 3 of the German Commercial Code on a straight-line
basis over a period of 10 years. Current developments are taken into account—if necessary—through
unscheduled amortisation.

**Tangible assets are valued at acquisition cost, taking into account scheduled depreciation. In the event of**
permanent impairment, unscheduled depreciation is taken into account. Scheduled depreciation on fixed
assets is exclusively carried out according to the straight-line method. Economic useful lives are used in the
consolidated financial statements instead of the tax useful lives used in the annual financial statement of the
parent company.

**Financial assets are valued at acquisition cost. If the value to be attributed to the financial assets on the**
balance sheet date is permanently impaired, this is recognised.

The valuation of raw materials and supplies as well as merchandise are carried out at acquisition cost in
compliance with the strict principle of low value.

**Unfinished goods are recognised at production cost, which includes direct production and material costs as**
well as an appropriate share of production, material and administrative overheads. Interest on borrowed
capital is not included in the production costs.

**Finished goods are valued according to the retrograde method by deducting the sales and distribution**
overheads still to be incurred as well as the profit margin from the sales price after sales deductions.

**Inventory risks are taken into account by applying appropriate valuation discounts.**

**Receivables and other assets are valued at nominal value or at the lower fair value on the balance sheet date.**
Appropriate individual value adjustments are made for receivables that are at risk due to individual risks; the
general credit risk is taken into account by means of lumpsum deductions. Receivables in foreign currencies
with a remaining term of less than one year are translated at the average spot exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Receivables in foreign currency with a remaining term of more than one year are recognised at the
lower of cost or the value resulting from the valuation at the average spot exchange rate on the balance sheet
date.

Trade receivables are sold by Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH and various subsidiaries within the framework
of ABS transactions; the credit risk is thereby transferred to the buyer. The trade receivables are reported at a
correspondingly reduced level. The administration of the receivables for the purchasers is carried out by Wepa
Hygieneprodukte GmbH or the respective subsidiary.

The subscribed capital is fully paid in and is shown at nominal value.

The pension provisions for vested rights and current pension obligations are calculated according to the
projected unit credit method using the “2018 G mortality tables” (Generationenrichttafeln) by Professor
Dr. Klaus Heubeck. The calculation was made in accordance with § 253 para. 1 sentence 2 of the German
Commercial Code, § 253 para. 2 of the German Commercial Code.

The average market interest rate of the past 10 financial years with a remaining term of 15 years of 2.32%
(previous year: 2.69%) was used for discounting in accordance with the Ordinance on the Discounting of
Provisions of 18 November 2009. A calculation using the average market interest rate of the past
7 financial years would result in a pension provision that is EUR 105,000 higher.

Expected salary increases were estimated at 2.0% (previous year: 2.0%) and pension increases at 2.0% (previous
year: 2.0%)were taken into account. As in the previous year, no fluctuation was taken into account. Expenses
or income resulting from changes in the discount rate are reported in the financial result.

The assets serving exclusively to fulfil the pension obligations and not accessible to all other creditors (plan
assets) are offset against the provisions at their fair value.

The long-term obligations of the foreign companies towards their employees were calculated according to the
country-specific conditions in analogous application of the provisions of commercial law. The corresponding
obligations are reported under other provisions.

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 (Continued)**

**Tax provisions and other provisions are made for all identifiable risks and uncertain liabilities. They are**
recognised at the settlement amount required according to reasonable commercial judgement, taking into
account price and cost increases. Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted at
the average market interest rate corresponding to their remaining term over the past seven financial years.

**Liabilities are recognised at the settlement amount. Liabilities in foreign currency with a remaining term of**
less than one year are translated at the average spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Liabilities in
foreign currencies with a remaining term of more than one year are recognised on the balance sheet date at the
higher of the acquisition cost or the value resulting from the valuation at the average spot exchange rate.

For the calculation of deferred taxes due to temporary or quasi-permanent differences between the commercial
law valuations of assets and liabilities and their tax valuations or due to tax loss carryforwards and tax credits,
the amounts of the tax burdens and tax relief expected to arise in the future are valued at the companyspecific tax rates at the time of the expected elimination of the differences and are not discounted.

As at 31 December 2020, deferred tax assets and liabilities from the individual financial statements and from
consolidation measures were netted as in the previous year and the excess was reported as deferred tax
liabilities.

**Notes to individual balance sheet items**

**Fixed assets**

The development of the individual fixed asset items, including depreciation and amortisation for the financial
year, is shown in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (Attachment 1 to the consolidated
notes).

**Goodwill**

Goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis in the current financial year. The initial consolidation of
Wepa CS Group GmbH and its subsidiaries resulted in goodwill of kEUR 2,144.

**Receivables and other assets**

As in the previous year, the receivables have a remaining term of less than one year. Receivables from
shareholders also relate to affiliated companies.

**Equity**

The subscribed capital of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH amounts to EUR 18,100,000.00.

In the financial year, a dividend of kEUR 9,112 was distributed to the shareholder using the previous year’s
net profit of kEUR 2,148 and the profit carried forward of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH in an amount of
kEUR 6,964.

Equity includes a negative difference from currency translation in the amount of kEUR 11,023. This amount
was calculated in accordance with § 308a of the German Commercial Code and results from the currency
translation of the individual financial statements included in the consolidation that are prepared in a currency
other than the Group currency, which is the euro (PLN and GBP).

Taking into account the existing statutory distribution restrictions of kEUR 8,478, an amount of
kEUR 132,055 is available to the shareholders of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH as distribution potential.

The entire development of equity is shown in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’equity as
an appendix to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The management of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH proposes to carry forward the net profit of the current
fiscal year in the amount of EUR 45.0 million.

**WEPA HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, ARNSBERG**

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 (Continued)**

A total of kEUR 9,807 is due within one year.

The order commitment as of 31 December 2020 is within the normal range for the industry.

**Off-balance transactions**

The WEPA Group has receivables-based financing (ABS structure) with a term until June 2023 and a
financing volume of up to EUR 180.0 million. The ABS financing is available to Wepa Hygieneprodukte
GmbH and various subsidiaries and was utilised by all companies in the amount of EUR 60.0 million
(previous year: EUR 110.0 million) on the balance sheet date.

In addition, a subsidiary of WEPA Hygieneprodukte GmbH has another receivables-based financing
arrangement (factoring) with a term until 31 December 2021 and a financing volume of up to EUR 35 million.
This financing is used in the amount of EUR 14.9 million at the balance sheet date.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange and raw material
procurement risks from booked, pending and planned underlying transactions. Hedging is carried out
exclusively in the name and for the account of Wepa Hygieneprodukte GmbH.

The booked and pending underlying transactions can be combined with the hedging transactions in micro
hedge and portfolio hedge German Commercial Code valuation units, separated according to commodity,
foreign exchange and interest rate hedging instruments. The valuation units of the German Commercial Code
are valued individually as at the balance sheet date.

The valuation methods and assumptions underlying the determination of the fair value are as follows:

FX forwards and FX swaps are valued at the forward rate on the balance sheet date. Options are evaluated
according to their design using Black-Scholes models or derived modifications. Instruments to hedge currency,
interest rate and commodity risks are valued by discounting the future cash flows. The discounting is carried
out using the market interest rates at the time of valuation over the remaining term of the instruments. The
amounts exchanged from these hedging instruments are recognised in profit or loss at the time of payment or
accrual on the reporting date.

According to valuation principles under commercial law, a negative valuation result of the respective hedging
transaction leads to the recognition of a provision for anticipated losses from pending transactions, insofar as
no effective valuation unit was initially formed, while a positive valuation result is not taken into account.

The WEPA Group strives to achieve a balanced risk/opportunity ratio. Therefore, depending on the
assessment of the market situation, the total requirement for currencies or financing volume over the course
of a year is generally hedged in a range between 50 % and 90 % in order to be able to adapt the price
calculations in case of unforeseen developments in interest rates and currencies. In the case of raw materials,
purchase prices are hedged via commodity swaps; here too, depending on the market situation, hedging is
aimed for, which generally ranges from 30 % to 90 % over the course of a year. The primary objective remains
to hedge the calculation rates on which the planning is based.

The following derivative financial positions existed as at the balance sheet date:

**WEPA HYGIENEPRODUKTE GMBH, ARNSBERG**

**CONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2020 (Continued)**

Provisions of kEUR 17,644 (previous year: kEUR 9,242) are made for negative market values of derivatives.
The nominal amounts of the derivative financial transactions correspond to the purchase or sale amounts or
the contract values of the hedged underlying transactions.

If there is a direct hedging relationship, the derivative financial instruments can be combined as a valuation
unit with an underlying transaction or the planned transaction. The WEPA Group chooses the so-called
freezing method for the balance sheet presentation of valuation units.

As at the reporting date, there are no valuation units in the WEPA Group.

**Disclosures regarding the consolidated statement of cash flow**

In accordance with German Accounting Standard 21 (GAS 21), cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash
on hand, bank balances and cheques due within three months (kEUR 32,107) less liabilities to banks due at
