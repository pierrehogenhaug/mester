In addition, the notes will be structurally junior in right of payment to all liabilities of the Parent’s non-guarantor subsidiaries (other than the Issuer). The net proceeds of this offering, along with cash on hand, are intended to be used to fund a Tender Offer (as defined herein) by the Parent and the Issuer for up to $1,250 million aggregate principal amount across the outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2020 and 6.750% Senior Notes due 2021 (each as defined herein) and to pay related fees, premiums and expenses.

1122,Offerings 2018.md,1282,"THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED BY ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY. FURTHERMORE, THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OR DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF THIS DOCUMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.",1282.5,Presentation of Financial Information Non-GAAP Financial Information,1282.5.1,,"To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA (as revised), Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, net total debt and net secured debt. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown under “Summary— Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information.” Management uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics in the evaluation of Company performance and the consolidated financial results and, in part, in the determination of cash bonuses for our executive officers. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our company. In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions we routinely receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to similar data, we have determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. However, non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude certain items as described below. Therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) and Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, could differ in meaningful ways from the terms “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” and “Pro Forma Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” as those terms are defined in the Credit Agreement and “Consolidated Cash Flow” as defined in the indenture. EBITDA is net income attributable to the Company (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) adjusted for the following items: interest expense, net; provision for income taxes; and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for certain items, as further described below. The Company has historically used Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its performance. Following an evaluation of the Company’s financial performance measures, new management of the Company identified certain new primary financial performance measures that it is now using to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. One of those measures is Adjusted EBITDA, which the Company uses for both actual results and guidance purposes. Management of the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, along with the other new measures, most appropriately reflect how the Company measures the business internally and sets operational goals and incentives, especially in light of the Company’s new strategies. In particular, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA focuses management on the Company’s underlying operational results and business performance. iv ----- As a result, the Company is now using Adjusted EBITDA both to assess the actual financial performance of the Company and to forecast future results as part of its guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors. In addition, commencing in 2017, cash bonuses for the Company’s executive officers and other key employees are based, in part, on the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA targets. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the adjustments below: Goodwill Impairment:_ The Company has excluded the impact of goodwill impairment. When the Company has made acquisitions where the consideration paid was in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired, the remaining purchase price is booked as goodwill. For assets that we developed ourselves, no goodwill is booked. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment. Goodwill is impaired when an impairment test indicates that the implied fair value of the goodwill acquired has fallen below its carrying value. Management excludes these charges in measuring the performance of the Company and the business. Restructuring and integration costs:_ Prior to 2016, the Company completed a number of acquisitions, which resulted in operating expenses which varied significantly from period to period and which would not otherwise have been incurred. The type, nature, size and frequency of the Company’s acquisitions have varied considerably from period to period. As a result, the type and amount of the restructuring, integration and deal costs have also varied significantly from acquisition to acquisition. In addition, the costs associated with an acquisition varied significantly from quarter to quarter, with most costs generally decreasing over time. Consequently, given the variability and volatility of these costs from acquisition to acquisition and period to period and because these costs are incremental and directly related to the acquisition, the Company does not view these costs as normal operating expenses. Furthermore, due to the volatility of these costs and due to the fact that they are directly related to the acquisitions, the Company believes that such costs should be excluded when assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses or assets as part of the Company. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drove the magnitude of such expenses, were not necessarily indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. In addition, since 2016 and for the foreseeable future, while the Company has undertaken fewer acquisitions, the Company has incurred (and anticipates continuing to incur) additional restructuring costs as it implements its new strategies, which will involve, among other things, internal reorganizations and divestitures of assets and businesses. The amount, size and timing of these costs fluctuates, depending on the reorganization or transaction and, as a result, the Company does not believe that such costs (and their impact) are representative of the underlying business. In each case, by excluding these expenses from its non-GAAP measures, management believes it provided supplemental information that assisted investors with their evaluation of the Company’s ability to utilize its existing assets and with its estimation of the long-term value that acquired assets would generate for the Company. Furthermore, the Company believes that the adjustments of these items provided supplemental information with regard to the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance, allowed for a comparison of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance and, as a result, provided useful supplemental information to investors. Acquired in-process research and development costs:_ The Company has excluded expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development, as these amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing, size and nature of acquisitions. Furthermore, as these amounts are associated with research and development acquired, they are not a representation of the Company’s research and development efforts during the period. v ----- Asset Impairments:_ The Company has excluded the impact of impairments of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangibles, as well as impairments of assets held for sale, as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Although the Company excludes intangible impairments from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Share-based compensation:_ The Company excludes the impact of costs relating to sharebased compensation. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense assists investors in the comparisons of operating results to peer companies. Sharebased compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. _Acquisition-related adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets and_ depreciation expense:_ The Company has excluded the impact of acquisition-related contingent consideration non-cash adjustments due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to fair value estimates, and the amount and frequency of such adjustments is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of the Company’s acquisitions, as well as the nature of the agreed-upon consideration. In addition, the Company has excluded the impact of fair value inventory amortization step-up resulting from acquisitions as the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of its acquisitions. Loss on extinguishment of debt:_ The Company has excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a cost of refinancing our existing debt and is not a reflection of our operations for the period. Further, the amount and frequency of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions and other factors in the debt market out of management’s control. Foreign exchange and other:_ For periods prior to 2017, the Company excluded the impact of foreign currency fluctuations primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements in evaluating Company performance. As of the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA no longer excludes foreign exchange gains and losses arising from intercompany transactions. Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) includes the foreign exchange gain/loss arising from intercompany transactions for all periods presented. Other Non-GAAP Charges:_ The Company has excluded certain other amounts including integration related inventory and technology transfer costs, CEO termination costs, legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with recent legal and governmental proceedings, investigations and information requests respecting certain of our distribution, marketing, pricing, disclosure and accounting practices, litigation and other matters, net (gain)/loss on sale of assets, acquisition-related transaction costs and certain costs associated with the wind-down of the arrangements with Philidor Rx Services, LLC (“Philidor”). In addition, the Company has excluded certain other expenses that are the result of other, non-comparable events to measure operating performance. These events arise outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Given the unique nature of the matters relating to these costs, the Company believes these items are not normal operating expenses. For example, legal settlements and judgments vary significantly, in their nature, size and frequency, and, due to this volatility, the Company believes the costs associated with legal settlements and judgments are not normal vi ----- operating expenses. In addition, as opposed to more ordinary course matters, the Company considers that each of the recent proceedings, investigations and information requests, given their nature and frequency, are outside of the ordinary course and relate to unique circumstances. The Company believes that the exclusion of such out-of-the-ordinary-course amounts provides supplemental information to assist in the comparison of the financial results of the Company from period to period and, therefore, provides useful supplemental information to investors. However, investors should understand that many of these costs could recur and that companies in our industry often face litigation. Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, is Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) after giving effect to the sale of the Company’s CeraVe[®], AcneFree[™] and AMBI[®] skincare brands (the “Skincare Sale”), the sale of all outstanding equity interests in Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Dendreon” and such sale, the “Dendreon Sale”), the sale of our iNova Pharmaceuticals business (“iNova” and such sale, the “iNova Sale”), the sale of our Obagi Medical Products, Inc. business (“Obagi” and such sale, the “Obagi Sale”) and the sale of our Sprout Pharmaceuticals, Inc. business (“Sprout”) to a buyer affiliated with certain former shareholders of Sprout (the “Sprout Sale”) in exchange for a 6% royalty on global sales of Addyi[®] (flibanserin 100 mg) beginning May 2019. The Skincare Sale was completed on March 3, 2017 and the Company no longer holds the rights to these three products. The CeraVe[®], AcneFree[™] and AMBI[®] skincare brands involved in the Skincare Sale contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Dendreon Sale was completed on June 28, 2017 and this business contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The iNova Sale was completed on September 29, 2017, and this business contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Obagi Sale was completed on November 9, 2017, and this business contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Sprout Sale was completed on December 20, 2017, and this business generated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $(30) million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

1122,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,The Company,9.1.1,,"We are a global company whose mission is to improve people’s lives with our health care products. We develop, manufacture and market a range of branded, generic and branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices (contact lenses, intraocular lenses, ophthalmic surgical equipment, and aesthetics devices) and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products, primarily in the therapeutic areas of eye-health, gastroenterology and dermatology. We are delivering on our commitments as we build an innovative company dedicated to advancing global health. The Company’s portfolio of products falls into three reportable segments: (i) Bausch + Lomb/International, (ii) Branded Rx and (iii) U.S. Diversified Products. - **_The Bausch + Lomb/International segment consists of: (i) sales in the U.S. of pharmaceutical products, OTC products and medical device products, primarily comprised of Bausch + Lomb products, with a focus on the Vision Care, Surgical, Consumer and Ophthalmology Rx products and (ii) sales in Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East of branded pharmaceutical products, branded generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products, medical device products and Bausch + Lomb products. - **_The Branded Rx segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) Salix products (gastrointestinal (“GI”) products), (ii) Ortho Dermatologics (dermatological products) and (iii) oncology (or Dendreon), dentistry and women’s health products (or Sprout). As a result of the divestiture of the Company’s equity interest in Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC on June 28, 2017 and Sprout Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on December 20, 2017, the Company has exited the oncology and women’s health business, respectively. - **_The U.S. Diversified Products segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) pharmaceutical products, OTC products and medical device products in the areas of neurology and certain other therapeutic classes, including aesthetics which includes the Solta business and the Obagi business (the Obagi Sale was completed on November 9, 2017) and (ii) authorized generic products. We are focused on the therapeutic areas of eye-health, gastroenterology and dermatology which we believe have the potential for strong operating margins and offer growth opportunities. We identify these businesses as “core”, meaning that we believe we are best positioned to grow and develop them. Through our output-focused R&D model, we have advanced certain development programs to drive commercial growth, while creating efficiencies in our R&D efforts and expenses. These R&D projects include certain products that we have dubbed our “Significant Seven,” which are products recently launched or expected to launch in the near term pending completion of testing and receiving FDA approval. Our 1 ----- Significant Seven are: (i) Vyzulta™(Bausch + Lomb), (ii) Siliq™(psoriasis), (iii) Jemdel™ (psoriasis), (iv) Lumify™(Bausch + Lomb), (v) Duobrii™(psoriasis), (vi) Relistor[®] (GI) and (vii) the Bausch + Lomb ULTRA[®] product lines (Bausch + Lomb).",N/A,as_expected,2018,164
1122,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Transformation,9.2.1,,"Prior to 2016, we had completed a series of mergers and acquisitions which were in-line with the Company’s previous strategy for growth. However, in response to changing business dynamics within our Company, we recognized the need to change our focus in order to build a world-class health care organization. In 2016, we retained a new executive team which immediately implemented a multi-year plan to stabilize, turnaround and transform the Company. _Stabilize_ In 2016 the new executive team: (i) identified and retained a new leadership team, (ii) enhanced the Company’s focus on core assets, which enabled the Company to recruit and retain stronger talent for its sales initiatives and (iii) realigned the Company’s operations to improve transparency and operational efficiency and better support the Company’s sales force. Once in place, the new leadership team began executing on the turnaround phase of the multi-year action plan and delivering on commitments to narrow the Company’s activities to our core businesses where we believe we have an existing and sustainable competitive edge and to identify opportunities to improve operational efficiencies and our capital structure. _Turnaround_ Throughout 2017 and into 2018, the Company continues to execute on its commitments to stabilize and turnaround the Company. During this time, we: (i) have better defined our core businesses, (ii) made measurable progress in improving our capital structure and (iii) have been aggressively addressing and resolving certain legacy matters to eliminate disruptions to our operations. _Focus on Core Businesses_ We have found and continue to believe that there is significant opportunity in the: (i) eye-health, (ii) GI and (iii) dermatology businesses. We believe that our existing portfolio, commercial footprint and pipeline of product development projects position us to successfully compete in these markets and provide us with the greatest opportunity to build value for our shareholders. We identify these businesses as “core”, meaning that we believe we are best positioned to grow and develop them. By narrowing our focus, we have the opportunity to reduce complexity in our operations and maximize the value of our core businesses. In order to focus our efforts, we performed a review of our portfolio of assets within these core businesses to identify those products where we believe we have, and can maintain, a competitive advantage and we continue to define and shape our operations and business strategies around these assets. Once we committed to our core businesses, we began analyzing what to do with those business units and assets that fall outside our definition of “core”. In order to focus on our objectives, we began divesting businesses and assets, which in each case, were not aligned with our core business objectives. This step not only allowed us to better focus our internal resources on our eye-health, GI and dermatology businesses, but also provided us with significant sources of capital which we used to reduce our debt and improve our capital structure. As a result of the focus on our core businesses and the divestitures of businesses not aligned with our core business objectives, as well as reduced sales of products in other segments due to the loss of exclusivity, we are seeing a greater portion of our revenues driven 2 ----- by our core businesses. In 2017 and 2016, our Bausch + Lomb, GI and dermatology revenues collectively represented approximately 66% and 62% of our total revenues, respectively. We expect this percentage to increase in 2018, as our recent and expected product launches are focused on these core businesses and the year-on-year comparison to widen as a result of the impact of 2017 divestitures of non-core businesses. The increase in this percentage demonstrates our convictions in these businesses. _Begin Redirecting the Allocation of Capital to Drive Growth_ The ranking of our business units during 2016 changed our view of how capital should be allocated across our activities. In support of our core activities, our leadership team aggressively reallocated resources to: (i) promote our core businesses, (ii) make strategic investments in our infrastructure and (iii) direct R&D to our Bausch + Lomb, GI and dermatology businesses to drive growth. The outcome of this process allows us to better drive value in our product portfolio and generate operational efficiencies. _Promotion of our Core Businesses_ To position the Company to drive the value of our core assets, we made a number of leadership changes and took steps to increase our promotional and sales force efforts, particularly in our GI and dermatology businesses. In support of our GI business, we initiated a significant sales force expansion program in December 2016 to reach potential primary care physician (“PCP”) prescribers of Xifaxan[®] for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (“IBS-D”) and Relistor[®] tablets for opioid induced constipation (“OIC”). In the first quarter of 2017, we hired approximately 250 trained and experienced sales force representatives and managers to create, bolster and sustain deep relationships with PCPs. With approximately 70% of IBS-D patients initially presenting symptoms to a PCP, we believe that the dedicated PCP sales force will be positioned to reach more patients in need of IBS-D treatment. The investment in these additional sales resources, including an increase in associated promotional costs, was in excess of $50 million in 2017. We consider these amounts well spent as they have allowed us to better capitalize on the potential of Xifaxan[®]. In addition, we have expanded our dedicated pain sales representatives to strengthen our position in the OIC market, and established a nurse educator team to educate clinical staff within top institutions. _Strategic Investments in our Infrastructure_ In support of our core businesses we have and continue to make strategic investments in our infrastructure, with the most significant investments seen at our Waterford facility in Ireland and our Rochester facility in New York. The investments at these facilities were made primarily in support of our Biotrue[®] ONEday and Bausch + Lomb ULTRA[®] contact lens businesses globally and our Bausch + Lomb Aqualox[®] contact lens business in Japan. _Direct R&D Investment to our Bausch + Lomb, GI and Dermatology Businesses to Drive Growth_ Our R&D organization focuses on the development of products through clinical trials. Currently, we have approximately 100 R&D projects in our global pipeline, and we launched and/or relaunched over 120 products globally during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 1,000 dedicated R&D and quality assurance employees in 23 R&D facilities were involved in our R&D efforts. Although R&D expense in 2017 was lower when compared to 2016 3 ----- by $60 million, R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was approximately 4% in 2017 and 2016. The decrease in dollars spent in 2017 is attributable to year over year phasing, as we completed the R&D investment in Siliq[TM] and other recently launched products requiring investment in 2016, removed projects related to businesses divested in 2017 and rebalanced our portfolio to better align with our long-term plans and focus on our Bausch + Lomb, GI and dermatology businesses. Our investment in R&D reflects our commitment to drive organic growth through internal development of new products, a pillar of our new strategy. In 2018, we anticipate R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to exceed 4%, which demonstrates our consistent commitment to our organic growth supported by investment in R&D strategy. In the U.S. alone, we have 71 projects focused on our core businesses in our pipeline and anticipate submitting over 60% of those projects for FDA approval in 2018 and 2019. Core assets that have received a significant portion of our R&D investment are listed below: - _Dermatology—Duobrii[™]_ (provisional name), under development as IDP-118, is the first and only topical lotion that contains a unique combination of halobetasol propionate and tazarotene for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Halobetasol propionate and tazarotene are each approved to treat plaque psoriasis when used separately, but are limited in duration of use. Halobetasol propionate may be used for up to two weeks and tazarotene may be limited due to irritation. Based on existing data from clinical studies, the combination of these ingredients in Duobrii[™] with a dual mechanism of action, potentially allows for expanded duration of use, with reduced adverse events. On November 2, 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted for review our New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Duobrii[™] and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) action date of June 18, 2018. - _Dermatology—Jemdel[™]_ (provisional name), under development as IDP-122, is a novel product that contains a unique, lower concentration of halobetasol propionate for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Halobetasol propionate is approved to treat plaque psoriasis, but is limited in duration of use. Based on existing data from clinical studies, this novel formulation potentially allows for expanded duration of use. On February 14, 2018, we announced that the FDA accepted for review our NDA for Jemdel™and set a PDUFA action date of October 5, 2018. - _Bausch + Lomb—Bausch + Lomb ULTRA[®]_ for Astigmatism is a monthly planned replacement contact lens for astigmatic patients.

Using cash generated from operations, the net cash proceeds from divestitures of non-core assets and cash generated from tighter working capital management, we repaid (net of additional borrowings) over $5,800 million of long-term debt during 2017 and 2016, in the aggregate. In January 2018, we also made the Term Loan Repayment (as defined below). See “—Recent Developments.” We accessed the credit markets in March, October, November and December of 2017, and completed a series of refinancing transactions to improve our capital structure, whereby we extended the maturities of certain debt obligations originally scheduled to mature in the years 2018 through 2022 out to March 2022 through December 2025. Furthermore, we extended $1,190 million of commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility, originally set to expire in April 2018, out to April 2020. 6 ----- 7 ----- On January 30, 2018, we made a $200 million payment of our Series F Tranche B Term Loan Facility due 2022 (the “Term Loan Repayment”), which we directed to be applied to satisfy (in part) payment of the expected $206 million Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) payment for 2017. Under our Credit Facilities (as defined below), subject to certain exceptions and reductions, we are required to make mandatory annual principal prepayments equal to 50% of the Company’s Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, if any, as defined in the Credit Agreement.

The notes will mature on, 2026. Interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will bear interest at a rate of % per annum payable semi-annually on and of each year, commencing, 2018. Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will initially be jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Parent and each of the Parent’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that is a guarantor under the Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Notes and our existing senior unsecured notes (the “Existing Senior Notes” and, together with the Existing Secured Notes, the “Existing Notes”). The guarantee of any subsidiary may be released under certain circumstances as described under “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.” Certain Note Guarantees may be subject to certain limitations. See “Risk Factors—Each guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable U.S. and Canadian laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to void the notes or the guarantees and any related security or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors may not be available to make payments in respect of the notes.” Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes and the guarantees will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors. Accordingly, they will: - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors, to the extent of the value of the collateral; 9 ----- - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors; - senior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors that expressly provides for its subordination to the notes; - structurally subordinated to the liabilities of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes to the extent of the value of such subsidiaries’ assets. As of December 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Recent Development Transactions and the Transactions, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors (including the Parent) would have had (i) $8.6 billion aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness outstanding, (ii) $16.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured indebtedness outstanding and (iii) approximately $1.1 billion would have been available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), after adjusting for outstanding standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017, we have no subordinated debt outstanding. In addition, the notes and the guarantees will be structurally junior in right of payment to all liabilities of the Parent’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, on a non-consolidated basis, the Parent’s non-guarantor subsidiaries had an aggregate of $3.2 billion of assets and $1.4 billion of liabilities. Optional Redemption of the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined herein), unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem all of the notes as described above, holders of the notes may require the Issuer to repurchase such holder’s notes, 10 ----- in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such series plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the purchase date applicable to the notes. Asset Sale Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . If we or our restricted subsidiaries engage in certain asset sales, we must either prepay certain debt, invest the net cash proceeds from such sales in our business within a specified period of time or make an offer to purchase a principal amount of notes equal to the excess net cash proceeds of such asset sale, subject to certain exceptions. The purchase price of the notes purchased will be 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date, and shall be payable in cash, as described under the heading “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.” Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture governing the notes will contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries (including the Issuer) to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; - make certain investments and other restricted payments; - create liens; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - engage in mergers, consolidations or amalgamations; and - transfer and sell assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. At any time the notes are rated investment grade, certain covenants will no longer be in effect for the remaining term of the notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade.” Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event that certain taxes are payable in respect of payments under or with respect to the guarantees, the Parent or the applicable Note Guarantor, other than Note Guarantors organized in the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, as the case may be, will, subject to certain exceptions, pay such additional amounts as will result, after deduction or withholding of such taxes, in holders or beneficial owners of notes receiving the amounts which such holder or beneficial owners of notes would have received in respect of the 11 ----- notes and the guarantees, respectively, had no such withholding or deduction been required. See “Description of the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts.” Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes, the guarantees and the indenture governing the notes will be governed by the law of the State of New York. Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . .

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of any future guarantor of the notes. Your rights under the guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi- jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, while the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will agree, in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes, to accept service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the indenture governing the notes or the notes brought in any federal or state court located in New York City by an agent designated for such purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits, actions or proceedings, it may be difficult for holders of the notes to effect service within the U.S. upon directors, officers and experts who are not residents of the U.S. in order to institute actions in U.S. courts predicated solely upon civil liability under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. There may be doubt as to the enforceability in non-U.S. jurisdictions in original actions, or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. You should not assume that the non-U.S. jurisdictions: (a) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S.; or (b) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S. 19 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

However, courts outside of the U.S. may not recognize the U.S. bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty administering a U.S. bankruptcy case or a ruling of a U.S. bankruptcy court involving the Parent, because its center of main interest and/or the substantial majority of its respective property are located outside of the U.S. Any orders or judgments of a bankruptcy court in the U.S. may not be enforceable against the Parent with respect to its property located outside the U.S. Similarly, under Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws, courts have jurisdiction over a debtor’s property wherever it is located, including property situated in other countries. However, courts outside of Canada may not recognize the Canadian court’s jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty administering a Canadian bankruptcy or insolvency case involving the Parent, because its center of main interest and/or the substantial majority of their respective property is located outside of Canada. Any orders or judgments of a Canadian court may not be enforceable against the Parent with respect to its property located outside Canada.

1122,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees,13.2.3,"Each guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable U.S. and Canadian laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to void the notes or the guarantees or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors may not be available to make payments in respect of the notes.","Each Note Guarantor will guarantee the payment of the notes on an unsecured basis and will provide the holders of the notes and the Trustee with a direct claim against each relevant Note Guarantor. However, the indenture will provide that each guarantee (other than the Parent’s guarantee) will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Note Guarantor without rendering the relevant guarantee, as it relates to that Note Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. The indenture will also permit guarantees by foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. For example, our subsidiaries in France can only guarantee the notes up to an amount equal to the amount of proceeds actually contributed to the French subsidiaries. Enforcement of any of the guarantees against any Note Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Note Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, transfer at undervalue, avoidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. The Issuer or its creditors or the creditors of one or more Note Guarantors could challenge the issuances of any of the notes or the guarantees as fraudulent transfers, conveyances or preferences, transfers at under value or on other grounds under applicable Canadian federal or provincial law or applicable U.S. federal or state law or other applicable law. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Note Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could also limit the enforceability of any guarantee against any Note Guarantor. 20 ----- A court could avoid the obligations under the notes or any guarantee or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes if, among other things, it were to determine that the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor: - issued the notes or guarantee with the intent to prefer or defeat, hinder, delay or defraud its existing or future creditors; - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing the notes or the guarantee; and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or the guarantee; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or - under Canadian law only and with respect only to the Note Guarantors that are Canadian companies, acted in an oppressive manner, unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly disregarded the interests of any stakeholder or other interested party. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of the Parent’s subsidiaries pursuant to the indenture, which are also subject to the risk of being avoided as a preference to the extent they are issued after the date this offering closes. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a Note Guarantor (other than the Parent) did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent such Note Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law being applied in any particular proceeding, such that we cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Note Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Note Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Note Guarantor was insolvent on the date its guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds under United States law. Generally, a Note Guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. The liability of each Note Guarantor under its guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside (although this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer laws). However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Note Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. 21 ----- Under U.S. and Canadian law, to the extent a court avoids a guarantee as a fraudulent transfer, preference or conveyance or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the notes would cease to have any direct claim against the Note Guarantor that delivered the guarantee and would be creditors solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Note Guarantor under the relevant guarantee which has not been avoided. In the event that any guarantee by a subsidiary of the Issuer is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the notes would be, to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Note Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the notes or any guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the notes.

If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Alternatively, as we have done in the past, we may also elect to refinance certain of our debt, for example, to extend maturities. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If 23 ----- we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of those capital markets or our own financial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be unable to refinance our debt. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Further, given our capital structure, any refinancing of our senior unsecured debt may be with secured debt, thereby increasing our secured leverage ratio.

1122,Offerings 2018.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.5,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS Credit Facilities,15.5.1,,"The following description is a summary and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the Credit Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to the Parent’s filings with the SEC. On February 13, 2012, the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries as guarantors entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended through the date hereof, the “Credit Agreement” and the facilities under such agreement, the “Credit Facilities”) with a syndicate of financial institutions and investors, as lenders. The Credit Agreement currently provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, including a sublimit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit and a sublimit for swing line loans (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and a senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”), which term loans mature on April 1, 2022. Set forth below is a summary of the Credit Facilities (as amended to the date of this Offering Memorandum), and this description is subject to the terms and provisions of the various agreements governing the Credit Facilities. The loans under the Credit Facilities may be made to, and the letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility may be issued on behalf of, the Parent. Subject to customary limitations, borrowings under the Credit Facilities are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default or an event of default and the accuracy in all material respects of representations and warranties. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the rate of interest quoted in the print edition of The Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section, as the Prime Rate (currently defined as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 75% of the nation’s thirty largest banks) and (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are between 2.25% to 2.75% with respect to base rate borrowings and between 3.25% to 3.75% with respect to LIBO rate borrowings based on the Company’s secured leverage ratio. These applicable margins are subject to increase or decrease quarterly based on the secured leverage ratio. Based on its calculation of the Company’s secured leverage ratio, management does not anticipate any such increase or decrease to the current applicable margins for the next applicable period. In addition, we are required to pay commitment fees of 0.50% per annum in respect of the unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears. We are also required to pay letter of credit fees on the maximum amount available to be drawn under all outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the applicable margin on LIBO rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on a per annum basis, payable quarterly in arrears, as well as customary fronting fees for the issuance of letters of credit and agency fees. Borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the rate of interest 33 ----- quoted in the print edition of The Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section, as the Prime Rate (currently defined as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 75% of the nation’s thirty largest banks) and (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% (provided however, that the base rate in respect of loans under the Term Loan B Facility shall at no time be less than 1.75% per annum) or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs (provided however, that the LIBO rate in respect of loans under the Term Loan B Facility shall at no time be less than 0.75%), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable interest rate margins for the Series F Tranche B Term Loan Facility are 2.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 3.50% with respect to LIBO rate borrowings. Subject to certain exceptions and customary baskets set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Parent is required to make mandatory prepayments of the loans under the Credit Facilities under certain circumstances, including from (1) 100% of net cash proceeds from asset sales outside the ordinary course of business (subject to reinvestment rights once we achieve a leverage ratio of less than 4.50:1.00), (2) 100% of the net cash proceeds of insurance and condemnation proceeds for property or asset losses (subject to reinvestment rights and net proceeds threshold), (3) 50% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities (subject to certain exceptions) subject to decrease based on leverage ratios, (4) 100% of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence of debt (other than permitted debt as specified in the Credit Agreement) and (5) 50% of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement, and net of certain amounts) subject to decrease based on leverage ratios. We are permitted to voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the revolving commitment amount and repay outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBO rate loans. We are permitted to voluntarily repay outstanding loans under any of the other Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than (i) customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBO rate loans and (ii) in the case of any prepayment of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans on or prior to May 21, 2018 in connection with a Repricing Transaction (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement), a prepayment premium of 1% of the amount of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans being prepaid (which prepayment premium also applies in the case of a repricing amendment). The Parent’s obligations and the obligations of the guarantors under the Credit Facilities and certain hedging arrangements and cash management arrangements entered into with lenders under the Credit Facilities (or affiliates thereof) are secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral subject to certain exclusions set forth in the credit documentation governing the Credit Facilities. The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict the Parent’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to: - incur additional indebtedness; - create liens; - enter into agreements and other arrangements that include negative pledge clauses; - pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; - create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions by subsidiaries; - make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions; 34 ----- - merge, amalgamate or sell assets, including equity interests of subsidiaries; - enter into sale and leaseback transactions; - engage in transactions with affiliates; - enter into new lines of business; and - enter into amendments of or waivers under subordinated indebtedness, organizational documents and certain other material agreements. The Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on us until the time that our leverage ratio (being the ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of such day to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the four fiscal quarter period ending on such date) is less than 4.50 to 1.00, including (i) imposing a $500 million per annum aggregate cap on acquisitions, subject to a 50% one year carry-over for unused amounts and certain other exceptions and applicable baskets, (ii) restricting the incurrence of debt to finance such acquisitions and (iii) requiring the net proceeds from certain asset sales be used to repay the term loans instead of being reinvested in the business. In addition, our ability to make certain other investments, dividends, distributions, share repurchases and other restricted payments will also be restricted and subject to the further limitations until our leverage ratio is less than 4.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement requires that we maintain a Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 3.00:1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, stepping down to 2.75:1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019 and thereafter. The Credit Agreement requires that we maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.50:1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, stepping up to 1.75:1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019 and thereafter. The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. If an event of default, as specified in the Credit Agreement, shall occur and be continuing, the Parent may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the Credit Facilities. We periodically review our debt profile with a view towards extending maturities and/or improving the terms of such debt. We may, from time to time, seek amendments to such debt in order to effect any such changes.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes repurchased to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will transmit a notice to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture (or in accordance with the procedures of the depositary) and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflict. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; 48 ----- (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes properly accepted together with an officers’ certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by the Issuer. The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or transmit by wire transfer) to each holder of notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers. Management evaluates transactions which could result in a Change of Control from time to time and may engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, Parent could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect Parent’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Liens”. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, (2) notice of redemption with respect to the notes has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price, or (3) after giving effect to such Change of Control, (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the Change of Control transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Parent, and (iii) the notes have received an Investment Grade Rating. In addition, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of launching the Change of Control Offer. The provisions under the indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control (including any required notice period) may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes, including after the entry into of an agreement that would result in the need to make a Change of Control Offer. 49 ----- With respect to the notes, in the event that holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, within 60 days of such purchase, the Issuer will have the right, upon not less than 30 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, to redeem all of the notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

(3) For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash: (a) any liabilities, as shown on Parent’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes and the Note Guarantees) (i) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to an agreement that releases Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability or (ii) that are discharged by the transferee in a transaction pursuant to which neither Parent nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any liability following such Asset Sale; (b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by Parent or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days after the consummation of the applicable Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and (c) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does not exceed at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of $800.0 million or 3.0% of Consolidated Total Assets. 50 ----- Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to those Net Proceeds: (1) to repay (w) Indebtedness and other Obligations under the Credit Agreement and, if the Indebtedness repaid under the Credit Agreement is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, (x) other secured indebtedness, (y) other Indebtedness which ranks pari passu in right of payment with the notes (provided, in the case of this clause (y), the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce obligations under the notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption,” through privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases (in each case, provided that such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof), or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, the pro rata principal amount of the notes) or (z) other Indebtedness of a Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) that does not Guarantee the notes, so long as the relevant assets were assets of such Subsidiary; (2) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted Business or the minority interest of any Permitted Business; (3) to make payments with respect to the acquisition or license of intellectual property rights that are used in a Permitted Business; (4) to make a capital expenditure in or that is useful in a Permitted Business; (5) to retire notes (x) pursuant to the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption,” (y) through privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases, or (z) by making an offer to purchase notes in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer; (6) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets (for the avoidance of doubt, including acquisitions of in-process research and development) under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; _provided that a binding commitment to apply any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale as set forth_ in clauses (2), (3), (4) or (6) above shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of the end of such 450-day period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary shall be permitted to apply the Net Proceeds in any manner set forth above before the expiration of such 180-day period and, in the event Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary fails to do so, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply an amount equal to any Net Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Proceeds from all Asset Sales which are not applied in accordance with this covenant exceed the greater of $275.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of receipt of such Net Proceeds. Pending application of an amount equal to Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, Parent or a Restricted 51 ----- Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding two paragraphs will constitute “Excess Proceeds”. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of $275.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, the Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness will be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance. The agreements governing Parent’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other Indebtedness, including any Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, may contain prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale. In addition, the exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale may cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control or Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect participants”). Persons who are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the participants or the indirect participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the participants and indirect participants. DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and 73 ----- (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the participants) or by the participants and the indirect participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Global Notes who are not participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are participants in such system. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./ N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or indirect participants. DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect 74 ----- participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers between the participants in DTC, on the one hand, and DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the DTC participant acting on its behalf to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC.

We intend to take the position that the possibility of such payments does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). If the IRS takes a contrary position, you may be required to accrue interest income based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury Regulations) determined at the time of issuance of the notes (which is not expected to differ significantly from the actual yield on the notes), with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from the payments based on the comparable yield.

It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will be issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. _Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_ Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a note, you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or other taxable disposition and your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note will generally equal the cost of your note. For these purposes, the amount realized does not include any amount attributable to accrued interest, which is treated as described under “Payments of Interest” above. Gain or loss realized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a note will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale or other taxable disposition the note has been held for more than one year.

In this case, you will be exempt from the withholding tax on interest discussed above, although you will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8 in order to claim an exemption from withholding.

The offering price for the notes is set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms with respect to the notes. The offering of the notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the purchase agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the notes pursuant to this offering memorandum. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the notes (A) to persons they reasonably believe to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the U.S. to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with sales outside the U.S., the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such notes within the U.S. by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own respective accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market.

Such agreement may be either confidentially acknowledged (constaté) by the President of the commercial court (in which case the agreement becomes immediately enforceable (exécutoire)) or approved (homologué) by the commercial court. The main consequences of the approval (homologation) by the commercial court will be the following: - creditors who provide new money or goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will enjoy a preferential treatment in the event of subsequent insolvency proceedings; and - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of the cessation des paiements, which is the starting date of the “hardening period” preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings (see below), cannot be fixed by the commercial court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval of the agreement. Conciliation proceedings are also confidential, but, in case of approval by the commercial court, third parties are informed that such an agreement has been entered into, through a publication. Conciliation proceedings may last up to five months. If a creditor seeks payment during conciliation proceedings, then pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having opened the conciliation proceedings has jurisdiction to grant a grace period to the debtor, in accordance with article 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code, provided that the debtor has received a formal notice requesting payment or faces enforcement measures, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard A-2 ----- the conciliator.

It is available only at the request of a debtor company. The objectives of safeguard proceedings are, in order of priority, to safeguard the debtor’s activity, to safeguard jobs and to pay creditors. French insolvency proceedings are safeguard proceedings (including accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings), judicial reorganization proceedings and judicial liquidation. The debtor must be solvent (i.e., not unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets) but experiencing difficulties that cannot be overcome. Safeguard proceedings are public and include an automatic stay of all actions against the debtor for up to six months, renewable for an additional six months with commercial court approval and which can be extended to a maximum of 18 months upon request of the state prosecutor. During this period (the “observation period”), the debtor and the insolvency officers try to elaborate a viable restructuring plan (including a debt restructuring) called the “safeguard plan,” and to have it adopted by the court. During the observation period, payments by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The supervising judge (juge-commissaire) can authorize payments for prepetition debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the business or get back goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings if they relate to expenses necessary for the business’s ordinary activities or are for the requirements of the proceedings. One of the main features of the safeguard proceedings consists in the creation of two creditors’ committees (mandatory for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding €20 million, optional below such thresholds), one consisting of credit institutions and “assimilated entities” (including not only credit institutions but also any entity having granted credit facilities to the debtor, and any assignees of such receivables) and the other of the main trade creditors (creditors whose claim is equal to more than 3% of the company’s total debt to its trade creditors), and a general meeting of noteholders (comprising all holders of all notes issued by the Company even they relate to different issues and no matter what the applicable law of those notes is) in the event the relevant debtor has issued bonds, to which the debtor submits a draft safeguard plan. Any member of the creditors’ committees (but not of the general meeting of noteholders) is also entitled to submit a draft safeguard plan. A-3 ----- The plan is approved where members of each committee voting in favor of the plan account for at least two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote. In cases where bonds have been issued by the relevant French company, the plan, if approved by the committees, is then submitted to the general meeting of noteholders (majority of two thirds of the outstanding claims of the noteholders expressing a vote). Each member of a committee or of the general meeting of noteholders must inform the court-appointed administrator of any agreement subjecting its vote to certain conditions or providing for the total or partial payment of its claim by a third-party or any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator can then modulate the voting rights of such a creditor, and submit to such creditor the conditions of calculation of its voting rights. In case of disagreement on this calculation, the creditor or the court-appointed administrator may seize the president of the court in summary proceedings. Those creditors or bondholders whose repayment terms are not affected by the draft plan or for which the draft plan provides for a full repayment in cash upon approval of the plan will not take part in the vote. The committees and the general meeting of noteholders, if any, shall vote on the plan within six months of the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings (subject to a potential court decision to postpone this deadline). Creditors which are not members of committees and which are not noteholders are consulted on an individual basis on debt rescheduling, write-offs and/or debt-for-equity swaps. Creditors are deemed to have accepted the debt rescheduling or write-offs proposals if they fail to respond within 30 days from the receipt of the debtor’s proposal. However, in respect to debt-for-equity swap proposals, the creditors’ representative must obtain the agreement of each creditor in writing. The plan submitted to the committees and the noteholders, if any, may include not only rescheduling of debts but also cancellation of debts and debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). The plan may provide for a different treatment of creditors if their differences of situation so justify. The plan must “take into account” intercreditor subordination agreements entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings (which does not mean that the plan must necessarily be totally compliant with such agreements). Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of noteholders, if any, and subject to verification by the commercial court that creditors’ interests are adequately preserved, the commercial court can approve the plan, in which case the plan will be binding also on dissenting members of the committees and on noteholders (if any). For those individual creditors which have not accepted the debtor’s proposals, the commercial court can reschedule repayment of their claims over a maximum period of 10 years, except for debts with maturity dates of more than 10 years, in which case the maturity date may remain the same. The commercial court cannot oblige such creditors to waive part of their claim. The first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the total admitted pre-filing liabilities). The commercial court can also adopt a safeguard plan in the absence of creditors’ committees (e.g., because such committees were not created or because they were dissolved following their failure to vote within the specified period or following their decision to reject the draft plan).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast track” the safeguard proceedings for large companies. The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings is roughly similar to the regular safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard proceedings. Therefore, some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims made by owners benefiting from retention of title clauses are, for instance, excluded by law. Trade creditors are involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings. Where accelerated safeguard proceedings are opened, the credit institutions committee, the trade creditors’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders are convened and are required to vote on the proposed accelerated safeguard plan within the minimum period of 15 days from delivery of the proposed plan (as applicable in safeguard proceedings). As with traditional safeguard proceedings, the plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings may notably provide for rescheduling of debts, debt cancellation or debt-for-equity swaps (requiring the relevant shareholder consent). The maximum duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months. If, during this period, no plan is adopted by the required majorities of the creditors’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders, the commercial court shall terminate the accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is similar to that applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings but it is designed to “fast-track” safeguard proceedings dealing with purely financial difficulties. The key difference between accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is that the latter relate only to debts owed to so-called “financial debts” (i.e., debts towards entities that are eligible members of the credit institutions’ committee and debts towards noteholders which are eligible members of the general meeting of noteholders described above), which are subjected to an automatic stay and dealt with under the safeguard plan. Other classes of creditors, such as A-5 ----- suppliers or public creditors, are not affected by the proceedings. The company therefore continues to trade normally while the proceedings are pending, thus reducing significantly the impact of such safeguard proceedings on operational companies. The same conditions mentioned above for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings also apply to a debtor eligible for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, provided that the accounts of the debtor offer evidence that a plan prepared in the context of conciliation proceedings is supported by a large majority of those financial creditors who will be affected by the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as indicated in the preceding paragraph), and is likely to be adopted within the duration of the procedure. The content of the safeguard plan and conditions of its adoption are the same as in accelerated safeguard proceedings, except that the credit institutions’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a shortened minimum period of eight days of being notified of the proposed plan. The duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings must not exceed one month, unless the commercial court decides to extend it by one additional month. If, during this period, no plan is adopted by the required majorities of the financial creditors and noteholders (the same majority rules apply as in committees in regular safeguard proceedings), the commercial court shall terminate the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings and may not impose any uniform debt rescheduling on creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor, the commercial court or the State prosecutor. The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming in cessation des paiements unless it has initiated a conciliation proceeding within the same period. If it does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto managers, may be subject to civil liability. The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the same as those of safeguard proceedings. Most of the rules applicable to safeguard proceedings apply to judicial reorganization proceedings. In particular, the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings triggers an automatic stay of proceedings against the debtor during the observation period (subject to the same limited exceptions). As with safeguard proceedings, the restructuring plan (the “reorganization plan”) may be adopted by two creditors’ committees (mandatory for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding € 20 million, optional below such thresholds), one consisting of credit institutions and “assimilated entities” and the other of the main trade creditors (creditors whose claim is equal to more than 3% of the company’s total debt to its trade creditors), and a general meeting of noteholders (comprising all holders of all notes issued by the company even they relate to different issues and no matter what the applicable law of those notes is). The reorganization plan can combine all of the following: a debt restructuring, a recapitalization of the company, a debt-for-equity swap (always with the relevant shareholder approval) and the sale of certain assets or of portions of the business. A-6 ----- In addition, Law No. 2015-990 dated August 6, 2015 (known as “loi Macron”) has introduced a new provision (Article L. 631-19-2 of the French Commercial Code) applicable to judicial reorganization proceedings opened as from August 7, 2015 in the cases where (i) a debtor (a) employs more than 150 employees or (b) controls one or more companies employing 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of such debtor is likely to cause serious disturbance to the national or local economy and to local employment, and (iii) a share capital modification appears, after review of total or partial disposal plan solutions, the only credible solution to avoid such a disturbance and to allow the debtor’s business activities to continue. In summary, if, in such event, a reorganization plan provides for a modification of the share capital in favor of one or more person(s) who undertake to execute the plan (e.g., the new majority shareholders) and the existing shareholders refuse to vote in favor of such share capital modification, the commercial court may, under certain procedural and substantial conditions (e.g., the payment to the evicted shareholders of an amount corresponding to the value of their shares, as determined by a commercial court-appointed expert if no agreement as to such value is reached among the parties) and upon request of the commercial court-appointed administrator or the State prosecutor, either (a) appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to vote in favor of a share capital increase in place of the dissenting shareholders or (b) order, in favor of the person(s) who have undertaken to execute the plan, the transfer of all or part of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholders who own a majority of voting rights or hold a blocking minority in the company. Any approval clause included in the company’s constitutional documents is deemed null and void. If no reorganization plan is drafted or if the draft reorganization plan appears obviously incapable of restoring the debtor’s viability, the court may decide to adopt a sale plan (plan de _cession), i.e., a plan whereby all or part of the business is sold to a third party which can cherry-_ pick the assets, contracts and employees, without (subject to certain exceptions) the need to obtain the consent of either the debtor, the creditors or the other party to certain contracts (such as lease-back agreements or supply agreements of goods and services). Any third party may make a bid to that effect as from the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings. If such a sale plan is adopted, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated for the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking of their claims. The sale price is generally significantly lower than the aggregate value of the assets, bearing in mind that the courts would endorse the most credible offer that would best ensure the preservation of jobs.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

However, in the decision commencing judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings or in a subsequent decision, a court may set the date on which the debtor became insolvent at an earlier date, up to 18 months prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings. This date is important because it marks the beginning of the “hardening period,” which lasts until the opening of the insolvency proceedings. Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the suspect period are, by law, automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include in particular transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. Such transactions or payments must be set aside by the court if a claimant (the judicial administrator, the liquidator, the creditors’ representative or the court-appointed trustee in charge of overseeing the implementation of the restructuring plan, or the State prosecutor) so requests. These include, notably, transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, security granted for debts previously incurred, provisional measures (unless the right of attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), share options granted or sold during the suspect period, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as a security for debt incurred at the same time), and any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that dedicates assets or rights as a guaranty of pre-existing debts. Voidable transactions include, (i) transactions for consideration, (ii) payments of due and payable debts or (iii) notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case, if such actions are taken after the debtor was in cessation des paiements and the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was in cessation des paiements at that time. In addition, transactions relating to transfers of assets for no consideration are also voidable when carried out during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the suspect period. Unlike void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable.” There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings, since the condition required to commence such proceedings is that the company is not insolvent (en état _de cessation des paiements) within the meaning of French law._ Article L. 650-1 of the French commercial code also provides that when safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings are initiated, creditors cannot be held liable for damages resulting from facilities that they granted, unless they acted fraudulently or deliberately interfered with the management of the debtor or if security interests granted to secure such facilities (which may include bonds) were out of proportion with the latter. Case law has recently set out that this liability would also require that the granting of the facility be A-8 ----- deemed to be wrongful. If the creditors are held liable, the security interests granted to secure the facility may be held void or reduced by a commercial court. The date at which the proportion should be analyzed is the date when the security interests were granted, not the date when they were enforced. With regard to the extent by which the security interests must exceed the amount of the facility to be considered “out of proportion” this is a question which is reviewed by French courts on a case-by-case basis.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period are, except with respect to very limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings and their unasserted claims are unenforceable (inopposables) during the safeguard or reorganization plan and even after the plan if the obligations under the plan have been complied with. Employees are not subject to such limits and are preferential creditors under French law. Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company’s obligations upon the opening of insolvency proceedings or the occurrence of a state of cessation des _paiements are not enforceable under French law. The commencement of liquidation_ proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of the company’s obligations. If, however, the court authorizes the company to continue its activity because a sale of all of the business is feasible, the company’s obligations which have not yet matured shall only mature as at the date of the judgment ordering such total sale of the business. The administrator may opt for the continuation (or not) of on-going contracts (contrats en cours) (except for employment contracts). The continuation of on-going contracts requires that the company fully performs its contractual obligations arising after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings.

Under Articles L.242-6 and L.244-1 of the French Commercial Code, directors and managers of a company incorporated as a société par actions simplifiée (simplified joint- stock company) such as the French Guarantors, may be prosecuted for misappropriation of corporate funds and/ or credit if they are determined to have, in bad faith, used the company’s property or credit in a manner which they knew to be contrary to the company’s interests for personal ends or for the benefit of another company in which they have a direct or indirect interest. Furthermore, under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and void, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French Guarantor did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. However, based on current case law certain inter-group transactions (including up-stream guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the relevant company, in particular, where the following four criteria are fulfilled: - existence of a genuine group of companies to which the guarantor and the person whose obligations are being guaranteed belong operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective and the guarantee, and the transaction to which they relate, must be entered into in furtherance of the common economic interest of the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate with such group benefit; - the risk assumed by a French Guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit; - the French Guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee which is commensurate with the liability which it takes on under the guarantee; and - the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial capability. A-10 ----- However, such criteria being subject to interpretation and depending on factual matters, the prudent approach prevailing in the French market is to create a strict correlation between the risk assumed and the benefit received by a French Guarantor without relying on the corporate benefit of the group (intérêt social de groupe) and applying the conditions listed above and therefore, limiting the amounts of the guarantee to the amounts on-lent to the French Guarantors as set out below. Each Guarantee provided by a French Guarantor will apply only insofar as required to: (i) guarantee the payment obligations under the Indenture and the notes of its direct or indirect subsidiaries which are or become Issuer or Note Guarantor from time to time under the Indenture and the notes and incurred by those subsidiaries as Issuer and Note Guarantors (without double counting). However, where such subsidiary is itself a Note Guarantor which guarantees the obligations of a member of the Group which is not a subsidiary of the relevant French Guarantor, the amounts payable by such French Guarantor under this paragraph (i) in respect of the obligations of this subsidiary as Note Guarantor shall be limited as set out in paragraph (ii) below; and (ii) guarantee the payment obligations under the Indenture and the notes of each other Issuer or Note Guarantor which is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of that French Guarantor, provided that in each case such guarantee shall be limited to the payment obligations of such other Issuer or Note Guarantor under the Indenture and the notes provided that these shall not exceed an amount equal to the aggregate of all amounts made available (directly or indirectly) to such other Issuer or Note Guarantor under the Indenture and the notes and on-lent (directly or indirectly by way of intra-group loans) to such French Guarantor and outstanding from time to time (such amount being the “French Maximum Guaranteed Amount”). It being specified that any payment made by such French Guarantor in accordance with paragraph (ii) above in respect of the obligations of any other Issuer or Note Guarantor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans (if any) due by such French Guarantor to that Issuer or Note Guarantor under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by a French Guarantor in respect of the payment obligations of an Issuer or a Note Guarantor referred to in paragraph (ii) above shall reduce the French Maximum Guaranteed Amount. No French Guarantor will secure liabilities under the Indenture and the notes which would result in such French Guarantor not complying with French financial assistance rules as set out in Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of Article L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) or any other law or regulations having the same effect, as interpreted by French courts. No French Guarantor will be acting jointly and severally with the Issuer and/or the other Note Guarantors and no French Guarantor shall be deemed to be a “co-débiteur solidaire” as to its obligations arising under or in connection with any such guarantee given in accordance with the Indenture and the notes. By virtue of this limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations under the Note Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the notes or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the Note Guarantee should the balance of the portion of the proceeds of the notes made available to a French Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to or reduced to zero. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a A-11 ----- transaction entered into on an arms’ length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arms’ length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances. The rights of the holders of the notes under the Note Guarantee are also subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Note Guarantee is also contractually adjusted so that such guarantee (together with the guarantee granted under the Credit Facilities) does not result in interest payments not being deductible for corporate income tax purposes when compared to the position that would have been applicable in the absence of such guarantee and indemnity obligations.

There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No 1346/2000 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to such Note Guarantors (together, the “German Guarantors”), is likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the German Guarantors were held to have its centre of main interest within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of the recovery of payments due on the notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a Member State other than Germany. This issue is to be determined at the time when the competent court decides on the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. A draft act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur _Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) is currently under discussion in_ Germany. However, according to this draft act it is mainly intended to provide for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The draft act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination A-13 ----- proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified form, this bill might be adopted by the German parliament. Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or if the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is overindebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable_ shareholder becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason (i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness) occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity of the debtor. The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s moveable assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status_ (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency proceeding in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). The order for opening an insolvency proceeding as debtor-in-possession proceeding requires that (i) it has been requested by the debtor and (ii) no circumstances are known which lead to the expectation that the order will place the creditors at a disadvantage. If the debtor’s request for debtor-in-possession proceeding does not manifestly lack the prospect of success, the court shall in the opening proceedings refrain from (i) imposing on the debtor a general prohibition on making dispositions or (ii) ordering that all of the debtor’s dispositions are effective only with the consent of a preliminary insolvency administrator. In this case, instead of a preliminary insolvency administrator, a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) shall be appointed who shall supervise the management of the debtor in the preliminary insolvency proceeding (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung). A-14 ----- If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove (by way of a certification provided by a tax advisor, accountant or lawyer with experience in insolvency matters) that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court shall, upon the request of the debtor, set a deadline of up to three months for submission of an insolvency plan (Schutzschirm). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and several other circumstances, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger _Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary creditors’ committee will be asked for their view on a_ petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which, depending on the circumstances, includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des _Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets_ (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In case the court orders for a debtor-in-possession status, the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to request the change of the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste _Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by_ head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual be eligible as officeholder (i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency A-15 ----- administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). From the perspective of the holders of the notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the insolvent entity would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung); - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such insolvent entity, disposals effected by the management of such insolvent entity, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of such insolvent entity’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against such insolvent entity may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the case of creditors secured by pledges over shares or company interests forming part of the insolvency estate it is, in the absence of authoritative case law, uncertain whether the creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or A-16 ----- whether the insolvency administrator has the right to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims— Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. The preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) of a creditor may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law, while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other unsubordinated claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; (v) claims for the restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan; and (vi) claims which the creditor and the debtor agreed to be subordinated in insolvency proceedings. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the insolvent entity. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such insolvent entity, the claims against that entity would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans will itself be exposed inter alia to a claw back risk with respect to repayments that have been made within the period of one year prior to the request to open insolvency proceedings or subsequent to such request (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the A-17 ----- insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (or in any transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from the transaction security was a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings aiming at the liquidation of the relevant insolvent debtor, the value of the insolvent entity’s assets may be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—be crammed down). The insolvent entity itself may only oppose the proposed plan if the plan is detrimental to the insolvent company (in comparison to an ordinary insolvency proceeding) or if any creditor will receive a higher economic value than the amount of its claim. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). In this case, the adoption of the insolvency plan generally also requires the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can—under certain circumstances—also be crammed down. Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate plus accrued interest. The administrator’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to any insolvent entity based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the notes may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the notes or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the notes or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid (plus accrued interest) to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the notes may only have a general unsecured claim under the notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) A-18 ----- detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental effect); - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche _Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the_ time of such act. Such intention of the debtor and the respective knowledge of the beneficiary shall be presumed if the debtor and the beneficiary knew of the debtor’s imminent insolvency, and that the transaction constituted a disadvantage for the creditors; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management board or supervisory board, general partners and A-19 ----- shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or provider of surety (Bürge) (in which case not the third party but the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” (Bargeschäft). In case of such “cash transaction”, the avoidance risk can— under certain circumstances— substantially be reduced. The German legislature is currently discussing a draft amendment concerning the statutory avoidance provisions in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Amendments are envisaged with regards to, among others, the provisions for avoidance claims in connection with willful disadvantage of the creditors, for cash transactions (Bargeschäfte) and the interest rates on avoidance claims. It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified form, this bill might be adopted by the German parliament. Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

Consequently, the granting of a Note Guarantee by such German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor is subject to certain A-20 ----- provisions relating to preservation of the statutory capital under the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”). These provisions would also apply to any future guarantor incorporated in the form of a GmbH or established as a limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner (“GmbH & Co. KG”; the German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor, any future subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated as a GmbH or established as a GmbH & Co. KG are hereinafter jointly referred to as a “German Subsidiary Guarantors” and each a “German Subsidiary Guarantor”). The enforcement of the Note Guarantee granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor to secure the Issuer’s debt will be limited if, and to the extent, payments under the Note Guarantee would cause the amount of such German Subsidiary Guarantor’s (or in the case the German Subsidiary Guarantor is a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets (i.e., total assets less liabilities and liability reserves) in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB)) to fall below the amount of its stated share capital. As a general rule, the provisions of the GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbHs net assets would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative amount of its net assets would further be reduced and prohibit payments to shareholders which render the German Subsidiary Guarantor unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Guarantees granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of liabilities or payments of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as payments under any arrangements that are not at arm’s length terms are considered disbursements under the provisions of the GmbHG. In order to enable German Subsidiary Guarantors to grant Guarantees to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating the provisions of the GmbHG and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees to contain so called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation language,” the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to enforce the guarantees against a German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG (or to release the proceeds of an enforcement, as applicable) only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s— or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s— net asset falling below the amount of its stated share capital or increasing such shortfall in order to avoid a violation of the applicable provisions of the German GmbHG. Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the documentation with respect to the Note Guarantee, to the extent provided by a German Subsidiary Guarantor, contains or will contain such contractual limitation language. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Note Guarantee granted by such German Subsidiary Guarantor cannot be enforced at all and the holders of the notes will lose the benefit of the Note Guarantee. The German capital maintenance rules and the other provisions referred to above are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Subsidiary Guarantors, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the notes or of a German Subsidiary Guarantors to make payments on the Note Guarantee. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so called “destructive interference” (existenzvemichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German Subsidiary Guarantor of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its A-21 ----- own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Note Guarantee granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Note Guarantee by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the respective German Subsidiary Guarantor of the Note Guarantee could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that a German Subsidiary Guarantor when granting the Note Guarantee was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

Examinership is a rescue mechanism which can be used by a company in financial difficulty where that company has a reasonable prospect of survival, if restructured. It allows a company a period of protection from its creditors within which time the examiner will endeavor to put together a survival plan. During this period of protection no holders of guarantees or security may take any steps to enforce such guarantees or security against the company. There are four primary pre-requisites to the appointment of an examiner: (i) that the company is, or is likely to be, unable to pay its debts; (ii) that no resolution subsists for the winding up of the company; (iii) that no order has been made for the winding up of the company; and (iv) that there is a reasonable prospect of survival of the company as a going concern.

The grant of a guarantee or making of a payment is an unfair preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the guarantee or payment had not been granted or made. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the commencement of the liquidation if the beneficiary of the guarantee or payment is not a “connected person”. The look back period is two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. In addition, the company must have been insolvent at the time it gave the preference or become unable to pay its debts as a result. A court will not make an order in respect of an unfair preference of a person unless it is satisfied that the dominant intention of the transaction was to prefer one creditor over other creditors.

Pursuant to the Irish Companies Act, if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the Irish High Court, that any property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on the company, its creditors or members, the Irish High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have “use, control or possession” of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit. There are also circumstances where a creditor or receiver could invoke this provision of Irish law where a winding-up has not taken place due to the lack of assets to fund a liquidation. There is relatively little case law on the interpretation of these sections of the Irish Companies Act. However, it is clear that the Irish High Court can apply a very wide interpretation to the provision so as to allow virtually any kind of transaction to come within its scope. It is also clear that the Irish High Court will not require the liquidator or creditor challenging a transaction to prove intent to defraud creditors, rather they will only have to show that the effect of the transaction was to perpetrate a fraud on creditors. Notwithstanding the lack of judicial guidance, it is considered likely that the Irish High Court would not regard a transaction as having the effect of a fraud upon creditors if the transaction was concluded on market terms and not at an undervalue so that, in effect, the balance sheet of the company concerned was not immediately adversely impacted following the completion of the transaction. Finally, it should be noted that in order for these provisions of the Irish Companies Act to have any effect on the entry into of, or any payment under, any guarantee of the notes by the Irish Guarantor, there must first be an insolvency of the Irish Guarantor (whether by virtue of liquidation, receivership or an examinership).",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2018,164

However, any obligation to pay a sum or money in any currency other than the euro will be enforceable in Luxembourg in terms of the euro only. The granting of cross- or up-stream security interests and guarantees by a Luxembourg company in order to secure the obligations of other entities may raise some corporate benefit issues, in particular in relation to the corporate interest of the Luxembourg company having to provide such security interests/guarantees. The Luxembourg company law does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A Luxembourg company must act for its own benefit (spécialité légale) and in its own corporate interest. Whether an action is in the corporate interest of a company is a matter of fact not a legal issue. The managers of a company are those who are able to assess whether such company has a corporate benefit and interest in granting cross- or up-stream guarantees. Under Luxembourg law, a company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate objects and in the best interest of the company. The test regarding the guarantor’s corporate interest is whether the company that provides the guarantee receives some consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. A guarantee that exceeds the guarantor company’s ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other creditors would expose its managers to personal liability. It cannot ultimately be excluded that granting of guarantee, which would be considered by a Luxembourg court as made in the absence of corporate interest, be declared void. The Note Guarantee granted by the Luxembourg Guarantors may be limited to a certain percentage of, among other things, the company’s own funds (capitaux propres) and intragroup indebtedness. Finally, each of the Luxembourg Guarantors has been incorporated in the form of a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée). Enforcement on these entities will depend on their financial situation and will only be limited to their assets. Shareholders of a private limited liability company cannot in principle be held liable for debts contracted by the private limited liability company.
