Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (the “Issuer”) is offering $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of % Senior
Notes due 2026 (the “notes”). Interest on the notes will accrue from the date of issuance and will be payable on and
of each year, commencing on, 2018. The notes will mature on, 2026.
The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after, 2022, at the redemption prices set forth in
this offering memorandum. In addition, some or all of the notes may be redeemed prior to, 2022, at a price equal to 100%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption plus a “makewhole” premium as described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to, 2021, up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the
redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum.
The notes will initially be guaranteed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., the indirect parent of the Issuer (“Valeant” or
the “Parent”), and each of its subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that is a guarantor under the Credit Agreement (as defined herein)
(together with the Parent, the “Note Guarantors”). The notes and the guarantees will be unsecured senior obligations and will rank
equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to the Issuer’s existing
and future subordinated indebtedness. The notes will be effectively junior to the Issuer’s existing and future secured indebtedness,
including the Issuer’s guarantee of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes (as defined herein), to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantees will be unsecured and will rank equally in right of
payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Note Guarantors and senior to the existing and future
subordinated indebtedness of the Note Guarantors. The guarantees will be effectively junior in right of payment to the existing and
future secured indebtedness of the Note Guarantors to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness, including the Note
Guarantors’ indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes. In addition, the notes will be structurally junior
in right of payment to all liabilities of the Parent’s non-guarantor subsidiaries (other than the Issuer).
The net proceeds of this offering, along with cash on hand, are intended to be used to fund a Tender Offer (as defined herein)
by the Parent and the Issuer for up to $1,250 million aggregate principal amount across the outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due
2020, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2020 and 6.750% Senior Notes due 2021 (each as defined herein) and to pay related fees,
premiums and expenses. To the extent less than $1,250 million of such notes are tendered in the Tender Offer, we will redeem a
portion of our outstanding notes with the net proceeds of this offering for a total aggregate repurchase (including under the
Tender Offer) of $1,250 million following the closing of this offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”
The Issuer is not obligated under any registration rights agreement or other obligation to register the notes for resale or to
exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction. The Issuer does not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of
the notes in any automated quotation system.
_Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 19._

**Industry and Market Data**

This offering memorandum includes and incorporates by reference information with
respect to market share, ranking and industry conditions from third-party sources or based upon

independent sources.

Any estimates underlying such market-derived information and other factors could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the independent parties’ estimates
and in our estimates.

**SEC and CSA Review**

We may receive comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and
the Canadian Securities Administrators (the “CSA”) on the filings we make with the SEC and the
CSA, respectively, that may require us to modify the information incorporated herein by
reference. In addition, the SEC or the CSA may issue guidance relating to existing practice in the
presentation of financial information or may promulgate new regulations that may require
modifications to the presentation of the information included in this offering memorandum,
including information incorporated herein by reference or in filings we make with the SEC or the
CSA, as the case may be. Any such modifications may be significant.

SEC rules regulate the use in filings with the SEC and certain of our other communications
of “non-GAAP financial measures”, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (as
reported), Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) and Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, which are
derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with accounting principles

iii


-----

generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). We believe the financial statements and other financial
data included in this offering memorandum comply in all material respects with GAAP and the
regulations published by the SEC, with the exceptions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA (as revised), Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, net
total debt and net secured debt and ratios using such non-GAAP measures. Please see
“Presentation of Financial Information” and “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated
Financial and Other Information.”

**Presentation of Financial Information**

**Non-GAAP Financial Information**

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain
non-GAAP financial measures including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted
EBITDA (as revised), Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, net total debt and net secured debt.
The reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial
measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown under “Summary—
Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information.”

Management uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics in the evaluation of Company
performance and the consolidated financial results and, in part, in the determination of cash
bonuses for our executive officers. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to
investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our company.
In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions we routinely receive from analysts
and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to similar data, we have
determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. However,
non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude
certain items as described below. Therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to
other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior
to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) and Adjusted EBITDA, as further
adjusted, could differ in meaningful ways from the terms “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” and
“Pro Forma Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” as those terms are defined in the Credit Agreement
and “Consolidated Cash Flow” as defined in the indenture.

EBITDA is net income attributable to the Company (its most directly comparable GAAP
financial measure) adjusted for the following items: interest expense, net; provision for income
taxes; and depreciation and amortization.

Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for certain items, as further described below. The
Company has historically used Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its performance. Following an
evaluation of the Company’s financial performance measures, new management of the
Company identified certain new primary financial performance measures that it is now using to
evaluate the Company’s financial performance. One of those measures is Adjusted EBITDA,
which the Company uses for both actual results and guidance purposes. Management of the
Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, along with the other new measures, most
appropriately reflect how the Company measures the business internally and sets operational
goals and incentives, especially in light of the Company’s new strategies. In particular, the
Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA focuses management on the Company’s underlying
operational results and business performance.

iv


-----

As a result, the Company is now using Adjusted EBITDA both to assess the actual financial
performance of the Company and to forecast future results as part of its guidance. Adjusted
EBITDA is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects
our financial performance based on operational factors. In addition, commencing in 2017, cash
bonuses for the Company’s executive officers and other key employees are based, in part, on
the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA targets.

Adjusted EBITDA reflects the adjustments below:

_Goodwill Impairment:_ The Company has excluded the impact of goodwill impairment.
When the Company has made acquisitions where the consideration paid was in excess of the
fair value of the net assets acquired, the remaining purchase price is booked as goodwill. For
assets that we developed ourselves, no goodwill is booked. Goodwill is not amortized but is
tested for impairment. Goodwill is impaired when an impairment test indicates that the implied
fair value of the goodwill acquired has fallen below its carrying value. Management excludes
these charges in measuring the performance of the Company and the business.

_Restructuring and integration costs:_ Prior to 2016, the Company completed a number of
acquisitions, which resulted in operating expenses which varied significantly from period to
period and which would not otherwise have been incurred. The type, nature, size and frequency
of the Company’s acquisitions have varied considerably from period to period. As a result, the
type and amount of the restructuring, integration and deal costs have also varied significantly
from acquisition to acquisition. In addition, the costs associated with an acquisition varied
significantly from quarter to quarter, with most costs generally decreasing over time.
Consequently, given the variability and volatility of these costs from acquisition to acquisition
and period to period and because these costs are incremental and directly related to the
acquisition, the Company does not view these costs as normal operating expenses.
Furthermore, due to the volatility of these costs and due to the fact that they are directly related
to the acquisitions, the Company believes that such costs should be excluded when assessing
or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses or assets as part of the
Company. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drove the
magnitude of such expenses, were not necessarily indicative of the size, complexity and/or
volume of any future acquisitions. In addition, since 2016 and for the foreseeable future, while
the Company has undertaken fewer acquisitions, the Company has incurred (and anticipates
continuing to incur) additional restructuring costs as it implements its new strategies, which will
involve, among other things, internal reorganizations and divestitures of assets and businesses.
The amount, size and timing of these costs fluctuates, depending on the reorganization or
transaction and, as a result, the Company does not believe that such costs (and their impact) are
representative of the underlying business. In each case, by excluding these expenses from its
non-GAAP measures, management believes it provided supplemental information that assisted
investors with their evaluation of the Company’s ability to utilize its existing assets and with its
estimation of the long-term value that acquired assets would generate for the Company.
Furthermore, the Company believes that the adjustments of these items provided supplemental
information with regard to the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance, allowed
for a comparison of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance
and, as a result, provided useful supplemental information to investors.

_Acquired in-process research and development costs:_ The Company has excluded
expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development, as these amounts are
inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing, size and
nature of acquisitions. Furthermore, as these amounts are associated with research and
development acquired, they are not a representation of the Company’s research and
development efforts during the period.

v


-----

_Asset Impairments:_ The Company has excluded the impact of impairments of finite-lived
and indefinite-lived intangibles, as well as impairments of assets held for sale, as such amounts
are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or
size of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company believes that the adjustments of these items
correlate with the sustainability of the Company’s operating performance. Although the
Company excludes intangible impairments from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes
that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue
generation.

_Share-based compensation:_ The Company excludes the impact of costs relating to sharebased compensation. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation
expense assists investors in the comparisons of operating results to peer companies. Sharebased compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of
awards granted.

_Acquisition-related adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets and_
_depreciation expense:_ The Company has excluded the impact of acquisition-related contingent
consideration non-cash adjustments due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated
with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to fair value estimates, and
the amount and frequency of such adjustments is not consistent and is significantly impacted by
the timing and size of the Company’s acquisitions, as well as the nature of the agreed-upon
consideration. In addition, the Company has excluded the impact of fair value inventory
amortization step-up resulting from acquisitions as the amount and frequency of such
adjustments are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of its
acquisitions.

_Loss on extinguishment of debt:_ The Company has excluded loss on extinguishment of
debt as this represents a cost of refinancing our existing debt and is not a reflection of our
operations for the period. Further, the amount and frequency of such charges are not consistent
and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions and other
factors in the debt market out of management’s control.

_Foreign exchange and other:_ For periods prior to 2017, the Company excluded the impact
of foreign currency fluctuations primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements in
evaluating Company performance. As of the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA no longer
excludes foreign exchange gains and losses arising from intercompany transactions. Adjusted
EBITDA (as revised) includes the foreign exchange gain/loss arising from intercompany
transactions for all periods presented.

_Other Non-GAAP Charges:_ The Company has excluded certain other amounts including
integration related inventory and technology transfer costs, CEO termination costs, legal and
other professional fees incurred in connection with recent legal and governmental proceedings,
investigations and information requests respecting certain of our distribution, marketing,
pricing, disclosure and accounting practices, litigation and other matters, net (gain)/loss on sale
of assets, acquisition-related transaction costs and certain costs associated with the wind-down
of the arrangements with Philidor Rx Services, LLC (“Philidor”). In addition, the Company has
excluded certain other expenses that are the result of other, non-comparable events to measure
operating performance. These events arise outside of the ordinary course of continuing
operations. Given the unique nature of the matters relating to these costs, the Company
believes these items are not normal operating expenses. For example, legal settlements and
judgments vary significantly, in their nature, size and frequency, and, due to this volatility, the
Company believes the costs associated with legal settlements and judgments are not normal

vi


-----

operating expenses. In addition, as opposed to more ordinary course matters, the Company
considers that each of the recent proceedings, investigations and information requests, given
their nature and frequency, are outside of the ordinary course and relate to unique
circumstances. The Company believes that the exclusion of such out-of-the-ordinary-course
amounts provides supplemental information to assist in the comparison of the financial results
of the Company from period to period and, therefore, provides useful supplemental information
to investors. However, investors should understand that many of these costs could recur and
that companies in our industry often face litigation.

Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, is Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) after giving effect to
the sale of the Company’s CeraVe[®], AcneFree[™] and AMBI[®] skincare brands (the “Skincare
Sale”), the sale of all outstanding equity interests in Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, LLC
(“Dendreon” and such sale, the “Dendreon Sale”), the sale of our iNova Pharmaceuticals
business (“iNova” and such sale, the “iNova Sale”), the sale of our Obagi Medical Products, Inc.
business (“Obagi” and such sale, the “Obagi Sale”) and the sale of our Sprout Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. business (“Sprout”) to a buyer affiliated with certain former shareholders of Sprout (the
“Sprout Sale”) in exchange for a 6% royalty on global sales of Addyi[®] (flibanserin 100 mg)
beginning May 2019. The Skincare Sale was completed on March 3, 2017 and the Company no
longer holds the rights to these three products. The CeraVe[®], AcneFree[™] and AMBI[®] skincare
brands involved in the Skincare Sale contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $15 million
for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Dendreon Sale was completed on June 28, 2017 and
this business contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $65 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017. The iNova Sale was completed on September 29, 2017, and this business
contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million for the year ended December 31,
2017. The Obagi Sale was completed on November 9, 2017, and this business contributed
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
Sprout Sale was completed on December 20, 2017, and this business generated Adjusted
EBITDA of approximately $(30) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We refer to these
transactions as the “2017 Disposition Transactions.”

**SUMMARY**

_The following summary should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety_
_by, the more detailed information and financial statements (including the accompanying notes)_
_appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum or incorporated by reference herein. To_
_understand this offering fully, you should read carefully the entire offering memorandum and_
_the information incorporated by reference herein, including the section of this offering_
_memorandum entitled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking_
_Statements.”_

_All references in this offering memorandum to “$” are to U.S. dollars._

**The Company**

We are a global company whose mission is to improve people’s lives with our health care
products. We develop, manufacture and market a range of branded, generic and branded
generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices (contact lenses, intraocular lenses, ophthalmic
surgical equipment, and aesthetics devices) and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products, primarily in
the therapeutic areas of eye-health, gastroenterology and dermatology. We are delivering on
our commitments as we build an innovative company dedicated to advancing global health.

The Company’s portfolio of products falls into three reportable segments: (i) Bausch +
Lomb/International, (ii) Branded Rx and (iii) U.S. Diversified Products.

   - **_The Bausch + Lomb/International segment consists of: (i) sales in the U.S. of_**
pharmaceutical products, OTC products and medical device products, primarily
comprised of Bausch + Lomb products, with a focus on the Vision Care, Surgical,
Consumer and Ophthalmology Rx products and (ii) sales in Canada, Europe, Asia,
Australia and New Zealand, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East of branded
pharmaceutical products, branded generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products,
medical device products and Bausch + Lomb products.

   - **_The Branded Rx segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) Salix products_**
(gastrointestinal (“GI”) products), (ii) Ortho Dermatologics (dermatological products)
and (iii) oncology (or Dendreon), dentistry and women’s health products (or Sprout). As
a result of the divestiture of the Company’s equity interest in Dendreon Pharmaceuticals
LLC on June 28, 2017 and Sprout Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on December 20, 2017, the
Company has exited the oncology and women’s health business, respectively.

   - **_The U.S. Diversified Products segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) pharmaceutical_**
products, OTC products and medical device products in the areas of neurology and
certain other therapeutic classes, including aesthetics which includes the Solta business
and the Obagi business (the Obagi Sale was completed on November 9, 2017) and
(ii) authorized generic products.

We are focused on the therapeutic areas of eye-health, gastroenterology and dermatology
which we believe have the potential for strong operating margins and offer growth
opportunities. We identify these businesses as “core”, meaning that we believe we are best
positioned to grow and develop them. Through our output-focused R&D model, we have
advanced certain development programs to drive commercial growth, while creating
efficiencies in our R&D efforts and expenses. These R&D projects include certain products that
we have dubbed our “Significant Seven,” which are products recently launched or expected to
launch in the near term pending completion of testing and receiving FDA approval. Our


1

Significant Seven are: (i) Vyzulta™(Bausch + Lomb), (ii) Siliq™(psoriasis), (iii) Jemdel™
(psoriasis), (iv) Lumify™(Bausch + Lomb), (v) Duobrii™(psoriasis), (vi) Relistor[®] (GI) and
(vii) the Bausch + Lomb ULTRA[®] product lines (Bausch + Lomb).

**Our Transformation**
Prior to 2016, we had completed a series of mergers and acquisitions which were in-line
with the Company’s previous strategy for growth. However, in response to changing business
dynamics within our Company, we recognized the need to change our focus in order to build a
world-class health care organization. In 2016, we retained a new executive team which
immediately implemented a multi-year plan to stabilize, turnaround and transform the
Company.

_Stabilize_
In 2016 the new executive team: (i) identified and retained a new leadership team, (ii)
enhanced the Company’s focus on core assets, which enabled the Company to recruit and retain
stronger talent for its sales initiatives and (iii) realigned the Company’s operations to improve
transparency and operational efficiency and better support the Company’s sales force. Once in
place, the new leadership team began executing on the turnaround phase of the multi-year
action plan and delivering on commitments to narrow the Company’s activities to our core
businesses where we believe we have an existing and sustainable competitive edge and to
identify opportunities to improve operational efficiencies and our capital structure.

_Turnaround_
Throughout 2017 and into 2018, the Company continues to execute on its commitments to
stabilize and turnaround the Company. During this time, we: (i) have better defined our core
businesses, (ii) made measurable progress in improving our capital structure and (iii) have been
aggressively addressing and resolving certain legacy matters to eliminate disruptions to our
operations.

_Focus on Core Businesses_
We have found and continue to believe that there is significant opportunity in the:
(i) eye-health, (ii) GI and (iii) dermatology businesses. We believe that our existing portfolio,
commercial footprint and pipeline of product development projects position us to successfully
compete in these markets and provide us with the greatest opportunity to build value for our
shareholders. We identify these businesses as “core”, meaning that we believe we are best
positioned to grow and develop them. By narrowing our focus, we have the opportunity to reduce
complexity in our operations and maximize the value of our core businesses. In order to focus our
efforts, we performed a review of our portfolio of assets within these core businesses to identify
those products where we believe we have, and can maintain, a competitive advantage and we
continue to define and shape our operations and business strategies around these assets.

Once we committed to our core businesses, we began analyzing what to do with those
business units and assets that fall outside our definition of “core”. In order to focus on our
objectives, we began divesting businesses and assets, which in each case, were not aligned
with our core business objectives. This step not only allowed us to better focus our internal
resources on our eye-health, GI and dermatology businesses, but also provided us with
significant sources of capital which we used to reduce our debt and improve our capital
structure.

As a result of the focus on our core businesses and the divestitures of businesses not
aligned with our core business objectives, as well as reduced sales of products in other
segments due to the loss of exclusivity, we are seeing a greater portion of our revenues driven


2


-----

by our core businesses. In 2017 and 2016, our Bausch + Lomb, GI and dermatology revenues
collectively represented approximately 66% and 62% of our total revenues, respectively. We
expect this percentage to increase in 2018, as our recent and expected product launches are
focused on these core businesses and the year-on-year comparison to widen as a result of the
impact of 2017 divestitures of non-core businesses. The increase in this percentage
demonstrates our convictions in these businesses.

_Begin Redirecting the Allocation of Capital to Drive Growth_

The ranking of our business units during 2016 changed our view of how capital should be
allocated across our activities. In support of our core activities, our leadership team aggressively
reallocated resources to: (i) promote our core businesses, (ii) make strategic investments in our
infrastructure and (iii) direct R&D to our Bausch + Lomb, GI and dermatology businesses to
drive growth. The outcome of this process allows us to better drive value in our product
portfolio and generate operational efficiencies.

_Promotion of our Core Businesses_

To position the Company to drive the value of our core assets, we made a number of
leadership changes and took steps to increase our promotional and sales force efforts,
particularly in our GI and dermatology businesses.

In support of our GI business, we initiated a significant sales force expansion program in
December 2016 to reach potential primary care physician (“PCP”) prescribers of Xifaxan[®] for
irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (“IBS-D”) and Relistor[®] tablets for opioid induced
constipation (“OIC”). In the first quarter of 2017, we hired approximately 250 trained and
experienced sales force representatives and managers to create, bolster and sustain deep
relationships with PCPs. With approximately 70% of IBS-D patients initially presenting
symptoms to a PCP, we believe that the dedicated PCP sales force will be positioned to reach
more patients in need of IBS-D treatment. The investment in these additional sales resources,
including an increase in associated promotional costs, was in excess of $50 million in 2017. We
consider these amounts well spent as they have allowed us to better capitalize on the potential
of Xifaxan[®]. In addition, we have expanded our dedicated pain sales representatives to
strengthen our position in the OIC market, and established a nurse educator team to educate
clinical staff within top institutions.

_Strategic Investments in our Infrastructure_

In support of our core businesses we have and continue to make strategic investments in
our infrastructure, with the most significant investments seen at our Waterford facility in Ireland
and our Rochester facility in New York. The investments at these facilities were made primarily
in support of our Biotrue[®] ONEday and Bausch + Lomb ULTRA[®] contact lens businesses
globally and our Bausch + Lomb Aqualox[®] contact lens business in Japan.

_Direct R&D Investment to our Bausch + Lomb, GI and Dermatology Businesses to Drive_
_Growth_

Our R&D organization focuses on the development of products through clinical trials.
Currently, we have approximately 100 R&D projects in our global pipeline, and we launched
and/or relaunched over 120 products globally during 2017. As of December 31, 2017,
approximately 1,000 dedicated R&D and quality assurance employees in 23 R&D facilities were
involved in our R&D efforts. Although R&D expense in 2017 was lower when compared to 2016


3


-----

by $60 million, R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was approximately 4% in 2017 and
2016. The decrease in dollars spent in 2017 is attributable to year over year phasing, as we
completed the R&D investment in Siliq[TM] and other recently launched products requiring
investment in 2016, removed projects related to businesses divested in 2017 and rebalanced our
portfolio to better align with our long-term plans and focus on our Bausch + Lomb, GI and
dermatology businesses.

Our investment in R&D reflects our commitment to drive organic growth through internal
development of new products, a pillar of our new strategy. In 2018, we anticipate R&D expense
as a percentage of revenue to exceed 4%, which demonstrates our consistent commitment to
our organic growth supported by investment in R&D strategy. In the U.S. alone, we have 71
projects focused on our core businesses in our pipeline and anticipate submitting over 60% of
those projects for FDA approval in 2018 and 2019.

Core assets that have received a significant portion of our R&D investment are listed below:

   - _Dermatology—Duobrii[™]_ (provisional name), under development as IDP-118, is the first
and only topical lotion that contains a unique combination of halobetasol propionate and
tazarotene for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in
adults. Halobetasol propionate and tazarotene are each approved to treat plaque
psoriasis when used separately, but are limited in duration of use. Halobetasol
propionate may be used for up to two weeks and tazarotene may be limited due to
irritation. Based on existing data from clinical studies, the combination of these
ingredients in Duobrii[™] with a dual mechanism of action, potentially allows for expanded
duration of use, with reduced adverse events. On November 2, 2017, we announced that
the FDA accepted for review our New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Duobrii[™] and set a
Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) action date of June 18, 2018.

   - _Dermatology—Jemdel[™]_ (provisional name), under development as IDP-122, is a novel
product that contains a unique, lower concentration of halobetasol propionate for the
treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Halobetasol propionate is approved to treat
plaque psoriasis, but is limited in duration of use. Based on existing data from clinical
studies, this novel formulation potentially allows for expanded duration of use. On
February 14, 2018, we announced that the FDA accepted for review our NDA for
Jemdel™and set a PDUFA action date of October 5, 2018.

   - _Bausch + Lomb—Bausch + Lomb ULTRA[®]_ for Astigmatism is a monthly planned
replacement contact lens for astigmatic patients. The Bausch + Lomb ULTRA[®] for
Astigmatism lens was developed using the proprietary MoistureSeal[®] technology. In
addition, the Bausch + Lomb ULTRA[®] for Astigmatism lens integrates an OpticAlign[™]
design engineered for lens stability and to promote a successful wearing experience for
the astigmatic patient. We launched this product and the extended power range for this

_Improve Capital Structure_

By executing our strategies during 2017, we have made measurable progress in improving
our capital structure through debt reduction and extending debt maturities. Using cash
generated from operations, the net cash proceeds from divestitures of non-core assets and cash
generated from tighter working capital management, we repaid (net of additional borrowings)
over $5,800 million of long-term debt during 2017 and 2016, in the aggregate. In January 2018,
we also made the Term Loan Repayment (as defined below). See “—Recent Developments.”

We accessed the credit markets in March, October, November and December of 2017, and
completed a series of refinancing transactions to improve our capital structure, whereby we
extended the maturities of certain debt obligations originally scheduled to mature in the years
2018 through 2022 out to March 2022 through December 2025. Furthermore, we extended
$1,190 million of commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility, originally set to expire in
April 2018, out to April 2020.

On January 30, 2018, we made a $200 million payment of our Series F Tranche B Term Loan
Facility due 2022 (the “Term Loan Repayment”), which we directed to be applied to satisfy (in
part) payment of the expected $206 million Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) payment for 2017. Under our Credit Facilities (as defined below), subject to
certain exceptions and reductions, we are required to make mandatory annual principal
prepayments equal to 50% of the Company’s Consolidated Excess Cash Flow, if any, as defined
in the Credit Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Credit Facilities.”

redeemed in full on March 30, 2018 using cash on hand in an amount equal to the remaining
principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest and a redemption premium (the “2020 Note
Redemption”).

We refer to the Letter of Credit Issuance, the Term Loan Repayment and the 2020 Note
Redemption as the “Recent Development Transactions.”

**Tender Offer**

On March 12, 2018, the Issuer commenced an offer (the “6.375% offer”) to purchase its
outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020, the Parent commenced an offer (the “VPII Tender
Offer”) to purchase its outstanding 5.375% Senior Notes due 2020, and the Issuer commenced
an offer (the “6.750% offer” and, together with the 6.375% offer, the “VPI Tender Offer”) to
purchase its outstanding 6.750% Senior Notes due 2021 (collectively, the “Tender Offer Notes”).
The offers to purchase the Tender Offer Notes are collectively referred to as the “Tender Offer.”
The Tender Offer will be limited in an amount of up to $1,250 million aggregate principal
amount across the Tender Offer Notes, as determined in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Tender Offer. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, in addition
to cash on hand, to fund the purchase of notes validly tendered and accepted for payment in the
Tender Offer. We cannot assure you that the Tender Offer will be completed on the terms
described in this Offering Memorandum, or at all. Nothing in this Offering Memorandum should
be construed as an offer to purchase any of our outstanding notes. The Tender Offer is being
made only upon the terms and conditions set forth in the related offer to purchase and letter of
transmittal. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

The Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 9, 2018
(the “Expiration Date”), unless extended or earlier terminated. We may elect, after 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on March 23, 2018 (the “Early Tender Deadline”) to accept for purchase at
any time all Tender Offer Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) on or before the
Early Tender Deadline. We have reserved the right, but are under no obligation, to increase or
decrease the total amount of the Tender Offer Notes purchased in the Tender Offer. The Tender
Offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the
consummation of this offering. This offering is not contingent on the consummation of the
Tender Offer. To the extent less than $1,250 million of the Tender Offer Notes are tendered in
the Tender Offer, we would redeem a portion of our outstanding notes for a total aggregate
repurchase (including under the Tender Offer) of $1,250 million following the closing of this
offering.

We refer to this offering collectively with the Tender Offer as the “Transactions.”

**The Offering**

The following summary contains basic information about the notes. For a more complete
understanding of the notes and this offering, see “Description of the Notes.”

Issuer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a Delaware
corporation (the “Issuer”), and wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
(“Valeant” or the “Parent”).

Notes Offered . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of %
Senior Notes due 2026.

Maturity Date . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will mature on, 2026.

Interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will bear interest at a rate of % per
annum payable semi-annually on and of
each year, commencing, 2018.

Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will initially be jointly and severally guaranteed
on a senior unsecured basis by the Parent and each of the
Parent’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that is a
guarantor under the Credit Agreement, the Existing
Secured Notes and our existing senior unsecured notes
(the “Existing Senior Notes” and, together with the
Existing Secured Notes, the “Existing Notes”). The
guarantee of any subsidiary may be released under certain
circumstances as described under “Description of the
Notes—Note Guarantees.”

Certain Note Guarantees may be subject to certain
limitations. See “Risk Factors—Each guarantee will be
subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be
limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses
that may limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable
U.S. and Canadian laws allow courts, under certain
circumstances, to void the notes or the guarantees and any
related security or take other actions detrimental to the
holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer
and the Note Guarantors may not be available to make
payments in respect of the notes.”

Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes and the guarantees will be senior unsecured
obligations of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors.
Accordingly, they will:

                   - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future
secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Note
Guarantors, to the extent of the value of the collateral;


9


-----

                   - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and
future unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and
the Note Guarantors;

                   - senior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the
Issuer and the Note Guarantors that expressly provides
for its subordination to the notes;

                     - structurally subordinated to the liabilities of any of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes to
the extent of the value of such subsidiaries’ assets.

As of December 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Recent
Development Transactions and the Transactions, the Issuer
and the Note Guarantors (including the Parent) would have
had (i) $8.6 billion aggregate principal amount of secured
indebtedness outstanding, (ii) $16.9 billion aggregate
principal amount of senior unsecured indebtedness
outstanding and (iii) approximately $1.1 billion would have
been available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit
Facility (as defined herein), after adjusting for outstanding
standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017, we have
no subordinated debt outstanding.

In addition, the notes and the guarantees will be
structurally junior in right of payment to all liabilities of the
Parent’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of December 31,
2017, on a non-consolidated basis, the Parent’s
non-guarantor subsidiaries had an aggregate of $3.2 billion
of assets and $1.4 billion of liabilities.

Optional Redemption of the
Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after, 2022 at the redemption prices set
forth in this offering memorandum. In addition, the notes
may be redeemed, in whole or in part, prior to,
2022 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the date of redemption plus a “make-whole”
premium as described under “Description of the Notes—
Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to, 2021
up to 40% of the aggregate amount of the notes may be
redeemed with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings
at the redemption price set forth under “Description of the
Notes—Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the date of redemption.

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined
herein), unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem
all of the notes as described above, holders of the notes
may require the Issuer to repurchase such holder’s notes,


10


-----

in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount of such series plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the purchase date applicable
to the notes.

Asset Sale Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . If we or our restricted subsidiaries engage in certain asset
sales, we must either prepay certain debt, invest the net
cash proceeds from such sales in our business within a
specified period of time or make an offer to purchase a
principal amount of notes equal to the excess net cash
proceeds of such asset sale, subject to certain exceptions.
The purchase price of the notes purchased will be 100% of
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but not including, the repurchase date, and shall be
payable in cash, as described under the heading
“Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales.”

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture governing the notes will contain covenants
that, among other things, limit the ability of the Parent and
its restricted subsidiaries (including the Issuer) to:

                    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

                 - make certain investments and other restricted
payments;

                      - create liens;

                     - enter into transactions with affiliates;

                  - engage in mergers, consolidations or amalgamations;
and

                     - transfer and sell assets.

These covenants are subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions. At any time the notes are rated
investment grade, certain covenants will no longer be in
effect for the remaining term of the notes. See “Description
of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants
When Notes Rated Investment Grade.”

Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event that certain taxes are payable in respect of
payments under or with respect to the guarantees, the
Parent or the applicable Note Guarantor, other than Note
Guarantors organized in the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, as the case may be,
will, subject to certain exceptions, pay such additional
amounts as will result, after deduction or withholding of
such taxes, in holders or beneficial owners of notes
receiving the amounts which such holder or beneficial
owners of notes would have received in respect of the


11


-----

notes and the guarantees, respectively, had no such
withholding or deduction been required. See “Description
of the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts.”

Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes, the guarantees and the indenture governing the
notes will be governed by the law of the State of New York.

Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes have not been and are not required to be
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities
laws. We do not intend to register the notes. Unless they
are registered, the notes may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws. The notes have not
been and will not be qualified for sale to the public by
prospectus under the securities laws of any province or
territory of Canada. The notes initially sold to investors in
Canada are subject to restrictions on transfer in Canada
and may not be sold or transferred directly or indirectly
except in compliance with applicable securities laws of any
province or territory of Canada. These resale restrictions
may in some circumstances apply to resales made outside
of Canada. See “Transfer Restrictions.” Additionally, the
indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will not
be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended (the “TIA”).

Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer intends to use the net proceeds of this offering,
along with cash on hand, to fund the Tender Offer by the
Parent and the Issuer for $1,250 million aggregate principal
amount of the Tender Offer Notes. To the extent less than
$1,250 million of the Tender Offer Notes are tendered in the
Tender Offer, we will redeem a portion of our outstanding
notes with the net proceeds of this offering for a total
aggregate repurchase (including under the Tender Offer) of
$1,250 million following the closing of this offering. See
“Use of Proceeds.” See “—Recent Developments—Tender
Offer.” The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective
affiliates may hold Tender Offer Notes, and the Initial
Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may therefore
receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. See “Use
of Proceeds” and “Plan of Distribution.”

No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . There is no public trading market for the notes, and we do
not intend to apply for a listing of the notes on any national
securities exchange or for quotation of the notes on any
automated dealer quotation system. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to the Notes—There is no established
trading market for the notes. If an actual trading market

does not develop for the notes, you may not be able to
resell them quickly, for the price that you paid or at all.”

**RISK FACTORS**

In addition to the other information included in and incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum, including the matters addressed in the section entitled “Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risks and
the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017, incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum before purchasing the notes. You
should also read and consider the other information in this offering memorandum and the other
documents incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. See “Where You Can
Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference.”

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

See Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Enforcing your rights against the Parent, as guarantor, or under the guarantees of the notes_**
**_by certain of its foreign subsidiaries across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Parent is a corporation continued under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act
and certain of our existing subsidiaries that will also guarantee the notes are organized in
multiple jurisdictions, including Australia, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada,
Colombia, England and Wales, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Slovenia,
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction
of organization of any future guarantor of the notes. Your rights under the guarantees will thus
be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively enforce
your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such
multi- jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result
in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

In addition, while the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will agree, in accordance with the
terms of the indenture governing the notes, to accept service of process in any suit, action or
proceeding with respect to the indenture governing the notes or the notes brought in any
federal or state court located in New York City by an agent designated for such purpose, and to
submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits, actions or proceedings, it
may be difficult for holders of the notes to effect service within the U.S. upon directors, officers
and experts who are not residents of the U.S. in order to institute actions in U.S. courts
predicated solely upon civil liability under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of
the U.S. There may be doubt as to the enforceability in non-U.S. jurisdictions in original actions,
or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely
upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. You should not assume
that the non-U.S. jurisdictions: (a) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions
against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the
U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S.; or (b) would enforce, in original actions,
liabilities against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws
of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within the U.S.

19


-----

**_You may have difficulty enforcing U.S. and Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws._**

Under the Bankruptcy Code, U.S. bankruptcy courts are given jurisdiction over a debtor’s
property wherever it is located, including property situated in other countries. However, courts
outside of the U.S. may not recognize the U.S. bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction. Accordingly, you
may have difficulty administering a U.S. bankruptcy case or a ruling of a U.S. bankruptcy court
involving the Parent, because its center of main interest and/or the substantial majority of its
respective property are located outside of the U.S. Any orders or judgments of a bankruptcy
court in the U.S. may not be enforceable against the Parent with respect to its property located
outside the U.S.

Similarly, under Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws, courts have jurisdiction over a
debtor’s property wherever it is located, including property situated in other countries.
However, courts outside of Canada may not recognize the Canadian court’s jurisdiction.
Accordingly, you may have difficulty administering a Canadian bankruptcy or insolvency case
involving the Parent, because its center of main interest and/or the substantial majority of their
respective property is located outside of Canada. Any orders or judgments of a Canadian court
may not be enforceable against the Parent with respect to its property located outside Canada.
Similar difficulties may arise in administering bankruptcy cases in other jurisdictions.

**_Each guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**
**_Applicable U.S. and Canadian laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to void the_**
**_notes or the guarantees or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes such_**
**_that the resources of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors may not be available to make_**
**_payments in respect of the notes._**

Each Note Guarantor will guarantee the payment of the notes on an unsecured basis and
will provide the holders of the notes and the Trustee with a direct claim against each relevant
Note Guarantor. However, the indenture will provide that each guarantee (other than the
Parent’s guarantee) will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the
relevant Note Guarantor without rendering the relevant guarantee, as it relates to that Note
Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement
of each guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. The indenture will
also permit guarantees by foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply
with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. For
example, our subsidiaries in France can only guarantee the notes up to an amount equal to the
amount of proceeds actually contributed to the French subsidiaries.

Enforcement of any of the guarantees against any Note Guarantor will be subject to certain
defenses available to Note Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses
generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, transfer at undervalue, avoidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges,
financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. The Issuer or its
creditors or the creditors of one or more Note Guarantors could challenge the issuances of any
of the notes or the guarantees as fraudulent transfers, conveyances or preferences, transfers at
under value or on other grounds under applicable Canadian federal or provincial law or
applicable U.S. federal or state law or other applicable law. If one or more of these laws and
defenses are applicable, a Note Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its
guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on
the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could also
limit the enforceability of any guarantee against any Note Guarantor.

20

A court could avoid the obligations under the notes or any guarantee or take other actions
detrimental to the holders of the notes if, among other things, it were to determine that the
Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor:

   - issued the notes or guarantee with the intent to prefer or defeat, hinder, delay or defraud
its existing or future creditors;

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing
the notes or the guarantee; and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of
issuing the notes or the guarantee; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized
because of the relevant guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would
incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or

   - under Canadian law only and with respect only to the Note Guarantors that are
Canadian companies, acted in an oppressive manner, unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly
disregarded the interests of any stakeholder or other interested party.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of the Parent’s
subsidiaries pursuant to the indenture, which are also subject to the risk of being avoided as a
preference to the extent they are issued after the date this offering closes.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the
transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court
would likely find that a Note Guarantor (other than the Parent) did not receive reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent such Note Guarantor did
not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the notes.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent transfer laws vary depending
upon the law being applied in any particular proceeding, such that we cannot assure you which
standard a court would apply in determining whether a Note Guarantor was “insolvent” at the
relevant time or that, regardless of method of valuation, a court would not determine that a
Note Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would not determine, regardless of
whether or not a Note Guarantor was insolvent on the date its guarantee was issued, that
payments to holders of the notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances
on other grounds under United States law. Generally, a Note Guarantor would be considered
insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all
of its assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be
required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities,
as they become absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

The liability of each Note Guarantor under its guarantee will be limited to the amount that
will result in such guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper
corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside (although this provision may not be effective
to protect the guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer laws). However, there
can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the
maximum liability of each Note Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may
be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

21


-----

Under U.S. and Canadian law, to the extent a court avoids a guarantee as a fraudulent
transfer, preference or conveyance or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the
notes would cease to have any direct claim against the Note Guarantor that delivered the
guarantee and would be creditors solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Note
Guarantor under the relevant guarantee which has not been avoided. In the event that any
guarantee by a subsidiary of the Issuer is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the notes
would be, to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, structurally subordinated to all
liabilities of the applicable Note Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the
notes or any guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is
otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the notes. Similar limitations could apply in other jurisdictions. See
“Annex A—Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability
of the Guarantees” for a discussion of certain limitations applicable to certain foreign
subsidiaries.

**_We have incurred significant indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby, which_**
**_restricts the manner in which we conduct business._**

We have incurred significant indebtedness, including in connection with our prior
acquisitions. As of December 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Recent Development
Transactions and the Transactions, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors (including the Parent)
would have had (i) $8.6 billion aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness
outstanding, (ii) $16.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured indebtedness
outstanding and (iii) approximately $1.1 billion would have been available for borrowing under
the Revolving Credit Facility, after adjusting for outstanding standby letters of credit. As of
December 31, 2017, we have no subordinated indebtedness outstanding. We may incur
additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs,
subject to certain restrictions and prohibitions under the agreements governing our
indebtedness, including the indenture governing the notes, which would increase our total debt.
This additional debt may be substantial and some of this indebtedness may be secured.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants which impose
certain limitations on the way we conduct our business, including limitations on the amount of
additional debt we are able to incur, prohibitions on incurring additional debt if certain financial
covenants are not met and restrictions on our ability to make certain investments and other
restricted payments. Any additional debt, to the extent we are able to incur it, may further
restrict the manner in which we conduct business. Such restrictions, prohibitions and
limitations could impact our ability to implement elements of our strategy, including in the
following ways:

   - our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the
pharmaceutical and medical device industries may be compromised;

   - we may be put at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that do not have as
much debt as we have, and competitors that may be in a more favorable position to
access additional capital resources;

   - our ability to make acquisitions and execute business development activities through
acquisitions will be limited and may, in future years, continue to be limited; and

   - our ability to resolve regulatory and litigation matters may be limited.

In the past, our credit ratings have been downgraded. Any further downgrade in our
corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and may
negatively impact our ability to raise additional debt capital.

22


-----

**_The notes will mature after a substantial portion of our other indebtedness._**

The notes will mature on, 2026. A substantial portion of our existing indebtedness
(including under the Credit Agreement and many of our Existing Notes) will mature prior to
those dates. Therefore, we will be required to repay a substantial portion of our other debt
before we are required to repay the notes. As a result, we may not have sufficient cash to repay
all amounts owing on the notes. There can be no assurance that we will have the ability to
borrow or otherwise raise the amounts necessary to repay or refinance such amounts.

**_The notes will be unsecured, and consequently the notes and the guarantees thereof will be_**
**_effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ existing and future secured_**
**_indebtedness._**

The notes and the note guarantees are unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to all
of the Issuer’s and the Note Guarantors’ secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the
assets securing such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Recent
Development Transactions and the Transactions, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors (including
the Parent) would have had (i) $8.6 billion aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness
outstanding and (ii) approximately $1.1 billion would have been available for borrowing under
the Revolving Credit Facility, after adjusting for outstanding standby letters of credit. Subject to
the limitations set forth in the indenture, we can incur additional secured debt. Upon any
distribution to our creditors in a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or similar proceeding
relating to us or our property, the holders of secured debt will be entitled to exercise the
remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law and pursuant to the instruments
governing such debt and to be paid in full from the assets securing that secured debt before any
payment may be made with respect to the notes. In that event, because the notes will not be
secured by any of the Issuer’s or the Note Guarantors’ assets, it is possible that there will be no
assets from which claims of holders of the notes can be satisfied or, if any assets remain, that
the remaining assets will be insufficient to satisfy those claims in full or at all. If the value of
such remaining assets is less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes and
all other debt ranking pari passu with the notes, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations
under the notes. In addition, if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our
secured debt, the holders of that secured debt would be entitled to foreclose on our assets
securing that secured debt and liquidate those assets. Accordingly, we may not have sufficient
funds to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, you may lose a portion of or the entire
value of your investment in the notes.

**_To service our debt, we will be required to generate a significant amount of cash. Our ability_**
**_to generate cash depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and_**
**_any failure to meet our debt obligations would have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the_**
**_market value of the notes to decline._**

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations
will depend principally upon our future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic
conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control,
may affect our ability to make payments on our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow
to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as
refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or
seeking to raise additional capital. Alternatively, as we have done in the past, we may also elect
to refinance certain of our debt, for example, to extend maturities. Our ability to restructure or
refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If

23


-----

we are unable to access the capital markets, whether because of the condition of those capital
markets or our own financial condition or reputation within such capital markets, we may be
unable to refinance our debt. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest
rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict
our business operations. Further, given our capital structure, any refinancing of our senior
unsecured debt may be with secured debt, thereby increasing our secured leverage ratio. Our
inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our
obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the
market value of the notes to decline.

Repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our
subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or
otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions
to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal
entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability
to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Certain non-guarantor subsidiaries include non-U.S.
subsidiaries that may be prohibited by law or other regulations from distributing funds to us
and/or we may be subject to payment of taxes and withholdings on such distributions. In the
event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries or receive cash via services
rendered and intellectual property licensed, we may be unable to make required principal and
interest payments on our indebtedness.

Our ability to continue to reduce our indebtedness will depend upon factors including our
future operating performance, our ability to access the capital markets to refinance existing debt
and prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which
are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance of the amount by which we will reduce
our debt, if at all. In addition, servicing our debt will result in a reduction in the amount of our
cash flow available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital expenditures that
could improve our competitive position and results of operations.

**_The Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our Existing Notes, as well as the_**
**_indenture governing the notes offered hereby, impose restrictive and financial covenants on_**
**_us. Our failure to comply with these covenants could trigger events, which could result in the_**
**_acceleration of the related debt, a cross-default or cross-acceleration to other debt,_**
**_foreclosure upon any collateral securing the debt and termination of any commitments to_**
**_lend, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,_**
**_cash flows and results of operations and would cause the market value of the notes to_**
**_decline and could lead to bankruptcy or liquidation._**

The Credit Agreement and the various indentures governing our Existing Notes, as well as
the indenture governing the notes offered hereby, contain covenants that restrict the way we
conduct business and require us to satisfy certain financial tests in order to incur debt or take
other actions. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that, for example,
require us to maintain certain financial ratios at fiscal quarter end.

The Revolving Credit Facility under the Company’s Credit Agreement contains specified
quarterly financial maintenance covenants (consisting of a secured leverage ratio and an
interest coverage ratio). As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial
maintenance covenants related to our outstanding debt. However, we can make no assurance
that we will be able to comply with the restrictive and financial covenants contained in the
Credit Agreement and indentures in the future. Based on our current forecast for the next twelve

24


-----

months from the date of issuance of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2017, we expect to remain in compliance with these financial maintenance
covenants and meet our debt obligations over that same period. In the event that we perform
below our forecasted levels, we will implement certain additional cost-efficiency initiatives, such
as rationalization of selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development
spend, which would allow us to continue to comply with the financial maintenance covenants.
We may consider taking other actions, including divesting other businesses and refinancing
debt as deemed appropriate. If we perform below our forecasted levels and the actions
referenced above are not effective, we would fail to comply with one or both of these financial
maintenance covenants. In that instance, we would be in default, and our lenders would be
permitted to accelerate our debt unless we could obtain an amendment. If our debt was
accelerated, we would not have sufficient funds to repay our debt absent a refinancing, and we
cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain a refinancing.

Our inability to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments could lead to a default or
an event of default under the terms thereof, for which we may need to seek relief from our
lenders and noteholders in order to waive the associated default or event of default and avoid a
potential acceleration of the related indebtedness or cross-default or cross-acceleration to other
debt. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such relief on commercially
reasonable terms or otherwise and we may be required to incur significant additional costs. In
addition, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and holders of our Existing Notes may impose
additional operating and financial restrictions on us as a condition to granting any such waiver.

If an event of default is not cured or is not otherwise waived, a majority of lenders in
principal amount under the Credit Agreement or the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of a series of our Existing Notes or the notes offered hereby may accelerate
the maturity of the related debt under these agreements, foreclose upon any collateral securing
the debt and terminate any commitments to lend, any of which would have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and would
cause the market value of our securities, including the notes, to decline. Furthermore, under
these circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our
obligations and we may be unable to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us or
at all. In such circumstances, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation and, as a result,
investors could lose all or a portion of their investment in the notes.

**_The assets of the Parent’s subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or a guarantor will be subject_**
**_to prior claims by creditors of those subsidiaries._**

You will not have a claim as a creditor against the Parent’s subsidiaries that are not the
Issuer or a guarantor of the notes. Not all of the Parent’s subsidiaries will guarantee the notes
and the Parent’s subsidiaries that do guarantee the notes may obtain releases of their
guarantees as set forth in the indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.”
Therefore, the assets of the Parent’s non-guarantor subsidiaries will be subject to prior claims
by creditors of those subsidiaries, whether secured or unsecured. In addition, unrestricted
subsidiaries under the indenture will not be subject to the covenants in the indenture. Except for
the Issuer and the Note Guarantors, the Parent’s subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent
or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the notes or to make any funds available to pay those
amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment. The notes will therefore be
structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of any non-guarantor
subsidiary of the Issuer such that, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,
dissolution or other winding up of any such subsidiary, all of such subsidiary’s creditors
(including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any) would be entitled to payment in full

25


-----

out of such subsidiary’s assets before the holders of the notes would be entitled to any
payment. The indenture will permit non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt, subject
to specified limits, and will not limit their ability to incur liabilities that do not constitute
indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, on a non-consolidated basis, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) had an aggregate of $3.2 billion of assets and $1.4 billion of
liabilities.

**_We may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt._**

Subject to the restrictions in the indenture governing the notes and our other outstanding
indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes, we may incur significant
additional debt, including secured debt that would be effectively senior to the notes. As of
December 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Recent Development Transactions and the
Transactions, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors (including the Parent) would have had (i)
$8.6 billion aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness outstanding, (ii) $16.9 billion
aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured indebtedness outstanding and
(iii) approximately $1.1 billion would have been available for borrowing under the Revolving
Credit Facility, after adjusting for outstanding standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017,
we have no subordinated debt outstanding. Although the terms of the Credit Agreement, the
indentures governing the Existing Notes and the indenture governing the notes contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, including secured debt, these restrictions are
subject to a number of important exceptions, including our ability under certain circumstances
to enter into new senior secured credit facilities that are secured by all of our and our
subsidiaries’ assets, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. If we and our restricted subsidiaries incur significant additional debt, the related
risks that we face could intensify.

**_Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws may impair the Trustee’s ability to enforce_**
**_remedies against the Company or under the guarantee of any Note Guarantor organized_**
**_under Canadian law._**

The rights of the Trustee who represents the holders of the notes to enforce remedies could
be delayed by the restructuring provisions of applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy,
insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought with
respect to the Company or any Note Guarantor organized under Canadian law. For example,
both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement
Act (Canada) contain provisions enabling an insolvent person to obtain a stay of proceedings
against its creditors and to file a proposal to be voted on by the various classes of its affected
creditors. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the notes or the guarantees
thereof would be made during any proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring,
whether or when the Trustee could exercise its rights under the indenture governing the notes
or whether and to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delays in
payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the
Trustee.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes if it experiences a change of control._**

The indenture governing the notes will require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the notes
when certain change of control events occur. If a change of control of the Company occurs, you
will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase some or all of your notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of your notes to be repurchased plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, the indentures

26


-----

governing the Existing Notes contain change of control provisions which give the holders of the
notes the right to require the applicable issuer thereunder to repurchase the notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the applicable notes to be repurchased
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date, and a change of control
may constitute a default under the Credit Agreement.

In the event that we experience a change of control that results in having to repurchase the
notes, we may not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy our obligations under the notes,
our Existing Notes and our other indebtedness. In addition, the change of control covenant in
the indenture governing the notes offered hereby will not cover all corporate reorganizations,
mergers or similar transactions and may not provide you with protection in a highly leveraged
transaction. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of
Control.”

**_The ability of holders of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase notes as a result of a_**
**_disposition of “substantially all” of the Company’s assets may be uncertain._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture governing the notes will include a
phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or
substantially all” of the assets or properties of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,”
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the
ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase such notes as a result of a sale,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets or properties of the Parent
and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights and we do not currently intend_**
**_to register the notes under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on your_**
**_ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and Canadian provincial securities laws and
we do not currently intend to register the notes or to offer to exchange the notes for notes
registered under the Securities Act. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to
register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the
U.S. or Canada only in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and Canadian provincial securities laws
or Canadian prospectus requirements, as applicable, and you may be required to bear the risk of
your investment for an indefinite period of time. Additionally, the indenture that will govern the
notes will not be subject to the provisions of the TIA. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_There is no established trading market for the notes. If an actual trading market does not_**
**_develop for the notes, you may not be able to resell them quickly, for the price that you paid_**
**_or at all._**

The notes will constitute a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We
do not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for any
quotation on any automated dealer quotation systems. The Initial Purchasers have advised us
that they intend to make a market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial
Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the notes at any time, in their sole discretion,
without prior notice. As a result, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any trading market
for the notes.

27


-----

We also cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or at
all, or that the prices that you receive when you sell them will be favorable. If no active trading
market develops, you may not be able to resell your notes at their fair market value, or at all.
The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be adversely affected by, among
other things:

   - prevailing interest rates;

   - our operating performance and financial condition;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market; and

   - the market for similar securities.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that
have caused volatility in prices of securities similar to the notes. It is possible that the market for
the notes will be subject to disruptions. Any disruptions may have a negative effect on
noteholders, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

**_Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the notes._**

Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when
due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the
value of the notes. These credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to
structure or marketing of the notes. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization.
Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. There can
be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that
such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in
each rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Since late 2015, our corporate credit
ratings have been lowered or revised on multiple occasions by both Moody’s Investors Service
(“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“Standard & Poor’s”). Any further downgrade in our
corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing and may
negatively impact our ability to raise additional debt capital.

Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any
announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the value
of the notes, may increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our ability to incur
additional debt.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture would not apply from and after such time that the_**
**_notes are rated investment grade by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, even if the notes are_**
**_subsequently rated below investment grade._**

Many of the covenants contained in the indenture relating to the notes will not apply from
and after such time that the notes are rated investment grade by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s,
and such covenants will not be reinstated if the notes are subsequently downgraded below
investment grade. These covenants restrict, among other things, the ability of the Parent and its
restricted subsidiaries (including the Issuer) to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or
issue preferred stock, to pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or
repurchase certain debt, sell assets, enter into certain merger transactions, enter into
transactions with affiliates, enter into agreements limiting the ability of subsidiaries to make
distributions and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the notes
will ever be rated investment grade, or that the notes will maintain such ratings. However,

28


-----

termination of these covenants will allow us to engage in certain actions that would not have
been permitted were these covenants in force, even if the notes are subsequently downgraded
below investment grade.

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required if this offering were being_**
**_registered with the SEC or qualified under applicable Canadian Securities Laws (as defined_**
**_herein)._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if
we were registering this offering of the notes with the SEC or qualifying it under applicable
Canadian Securities Laws. Among other things, we have not included any footnotes in our
financial statements that show condensed consolidating financial information for us and the
guarantors of the notes. See “Presentation of Financial Information—Financial Information with
Respect to Note Guarantors and Stock Pledges.” This lack of information could affect your
ability to evaluate your investment in the notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the Issuer will receive net proceeds from this offering, after giving effect to
the Initial Purchasers’ discount and fees and expenses payable by us, of approximately
$ million.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, along with cash on hand, to fund the
Tender Offer by Valeant and the Issuer for $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of the
Tender Offer Notes and to pay related fees, premiums and expenses. To the extent less than
$1,250 million of the Tender Offer Notes are tendered in the Tender Offer, we will redeem a
portion of our outstanding notes with the net proceeds of this offering for a total aggregate
repurchase (including under the Tender Offer) of $1,250 million following the closing of this
offering. See “Summary—Tender Offer” and “Capitalization.”

The following table outlines the intended sources and uses of funds for the Transactions:

The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may hold Tender Offer Notes, and the
Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may therefore receive a portion of the
proceeds of this offering. See “Plan of Distribution.”

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Credit Facilities**

The following description is a summary and should be read in conjunction with, and is
qualified in its entirety by, the Credit Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to the Parent’s
filings with the SEC.

On February 13, 2012, the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries as guarantors entered into
the Third Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended through the date
hereof, the “Credit Agreement” and the facilities under such agreement, the “Credit Facilities”)
with a syndicate of financial institutions and investors, as lenders. The Credit Agreement
currently provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, including a sublimit for the issuance
of standby and commercial letters of credit and a sublimit for swing line loans (the “Revolving
Credit Facility”) and a senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”), which
term loans mature on April 1, 2022.

Set forth below is a summary of the Credit Facilities (as amended to the date of this
Offering Memorandum), and this description is subject to the terms and provisions of the
various agreements governing the Credit Facilities.

The loans under the Credit Facilities may be made to, and the letters of credit under the
Revolving Credit Facility may be issued on behalf of, the Parent. Subject to customary
limitations, borrowings under the Credit Facilities are subject to the satisfaction of customary
conditions, including the absence of a default or an event of default and the accuracy in all
material respects of representations and warranties.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at
our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the rate of interest
quoted in the print edition of The Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section, as the Prime Rate
(currently defined as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 75% of the nation’s
thirty largest banks) and (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) a LIBO rate
determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period
relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, in each case plus an applicable
margin.

The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are
between 2.25% to 2.75% with respect to base rate borrowings and between 3.25% to 3.75% with
respect to LIBO rate borrowings based on the Company’s secured leverage ratio. These
applicable margins are subject to increase or decrease quarterly based on the secured leverage
ratio. Based on its calculation of the Company’s secured leverage ratio, management does not
anticipate any such increase or decrease to the current applicable margins for the next
applicable period. In addition, we are required to pay commitment fees of 0.50% per annum in
respect of the unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in
arrears. We are also required to pay letter of credit fees on the maximum amount available to
be drawn under all outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the applicable margin on
LIBO rate borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on a per annum basis, payable
quarterly in arrears, as well as customary fronting fees for the issuance of letters of credit and
agency fees.

Borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our
option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the rate of interest

33


-----

quoted in the print edition of The Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section, as the Prime Rate
(currently defined as the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 75% of the nation’s
thirty largest banks) and (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% (provided however,
that the base rate in respect of loans under the Term Loan B Facility shall at no time be less than
1.75% per annum) or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S.
dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional
costs (provided however, that the LIBO rate in respect of loans under the Term Loan B Facility
shall at no time be less than 0.75%), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable
interest rate margins for the Series F Tranche B Term Loan Facility are 2.50% with respect to
base rate borrowings and 3.50% with respect to LIBO rate borrowings.

Subject to certain exceptions and customary baskets set forth in the Credit Agreement, the
Parent is required to make mandatory prepayments of the loans under the Credit Facilities
under certain circumstances, including from (1) 100% of net cash proceeds from asset sales
outside the ordinary course of business (subject to reinvestment rights once we achieve a
leverage ratio of less than 4.50:1.00), (2) 100% of the net cash proceeds of insurance and
condemnation proceeds for property or asset losses (subject to reinvestment rights and net
proceeds threshold), (3) 50% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities
(subject to certain exceptions) subject to decrease based on leverage ratios, (4) 100% of the net
cash proceeds from the incurrence of debt (other than permitted debt as specified in the Credit
Agreement) and (5) 50% of Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement,
and net of certain amounts) subject to decrease based on leverage ratios.

We are permitted to voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the revolving commitment
amount and repay outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without
premium or penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBO rate loans. We
are permitted to voluntarily repay outstanding loans under any of the other Credit Facilities at
any time without premium or penalty, other than (i) customary “breakage” costs with respect to
LIBO rate loans and (ii) in the case of any prepayment of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans on
or prior to May 21, 2018 in connection with a Repricing Transaction (as such term is defined in
the Credit Agreement), a prepayment premium of 1% of the amount of the Series F Tranche B
Term Loans being prepaid (which prepayment premium also applies in the case of a repricing
amendment).

The Parent’s obligations and the obligations of the guarantors under the Credit Facilities
and certain hedging arrangements and cash management arrangements entered into with
lenders under the Credit Facilities (or affiliates thereof) are secured by first-priority security
interests in the Collateral subject to certain exclusions set forth in the credit documentation
governing the Credit Facilities.

The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things and
subject to certain exceptions, restrict the Parent’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to:

   - incur additional indebtedness;

   - create liens;

   - enter into agreements and other arrangements that include negative pledge clauses;

   - pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or
subordinated indebtedness;

   - create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions by subsidiaries;

   - make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;

34


-----

   - merge, amalgamate or sell assets, including equity interests of subsidiaries;

   - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

   - engage in transactions with affiliates;

   - enter into new lines of business; and

   - enter into amendments of or waivers under subordinated indebtedness, organizational
documents and certain other material agreements.

The Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on us until the time that our
leverage ratio (being the ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, of Consolidated Total Debt
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of such day to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) for the four fiscal quarter period ending on such date) is less
than 4.50 to 1.00, including (i) imposing a $500 million per annum aggregate cap on
acquisitions, subject to a 50% one year carry-over for unused amounts and certain other
exceptions and applicable baskets, (ii) restricting the incurrence of debt to finance such
acquisitions and (iii) requiring the net proceeds from certain asset sales be used to repay the
term loans instead of being reinvested in the business. In addition, our ability to make certain
other investments, dividends, distributions, share repurchases and other restricted payments
will also be restricted and subject to the further limitations until our leverage ratio is less than
4.00 to 1.00.

The Credit Agreement requires that we maintain a Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 3.00:1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through
the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, stepping down to 2.75:1.00 for any fiscal quarter
ending June 30, 2019 and thereafter. The Credit Agreement requires that we maintain an
Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.50:1.00 as of the
last day of each fiscal quarter through the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, stepping up to
1.75:1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019 and thereafter.

The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of
default. If an event of default, as specified in the Credit Agreement, shall occur and be
continuing, the Parent may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit
Facilities. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with
the Credit Facilities. We periodically review our debt profile with a view towards extending
maturities and/or improving the terms of such debt. We may, from time to time, seek
amendments to such debt in order to effect any such changes.

Secured Notes and March 2024 Senior Secured Notes.

The March 2022 Senior Secured Notes and March 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the
guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the Parent’s and Note Guarantors’
(including the Issuer’s) respective existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and senior
to the Company’s and Note Guarantors’ respective future subordinated indebtedness. The
March 2022 Senior Secured Notes and March 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees
related thereto are effectively pari passu with the Parent’s and the Note Guarantors’ respective
existing and future indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the collateral securing the
March 2022 Senior Secured Notes and March 2024 Senior Secured Notes and effectively senior
to the Parent’s and the Note Guarantors’ (including the Issuer’s) respective existing and future

Senior Secured Notes and March 2024 Senior Secured Notes may require the Parent to
repurchase such holder’s notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this section of the offering
memorandum under the subheading “—Certain Definitions”. In this section, (i) the term
“Issuer” refers only to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a Delaware corporation, and its
successors and not to any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) the term “Parent” refers only to Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., the indirect parent of the Issuer and a British Columbia
corporation, and its successors and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue the % Senior Notes due 2026 (the “notes”) under an indenture,
dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Note Guarantors, The Bank of New York
Mellon, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The indenture will not be subject to the provisions of the TIA.
Holders of the notes will not be entitled to any registration rights or similar rights.

The Issuer has the right to issue additional notes in the future. Any such additional notes
will have the same terms as the notes being offered by this offering memorandum but may be
offered at a different offering price or have a different initial interest payment date than the

part of the same series as the notes being offered by this offering memorandum.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture. It does
not restate the indenture in its entirety. We urge you to read the indenture because it, and not

available as set forth below under “—Additional Information”. Certain defined terms used in
this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions” have the meanings
assigned to them in the indenture.

The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. The
registered holders of the notes are those that own notes registered in their own names on the
books that the Issuer or the Trustee maintains for this purpose, and not those who own
beneficial interests in the notes registered in street name or in notes issued in book-entry form
through one or more depositaries. Only registered holders will have rights under the indenture.
Owners of beneficial interests in the notes should read the information contained under the
subheading “—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

issue additional notes under the indenture from time to time after this offering. Any offering of
additional notes is subject to the covenants described below under the captions “—Certain
Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Certain
Covenants—Liens.” The notes and any additional notes subsequently issued under the
indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the indenture, including,
without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. The Issuer will
issue the notes in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The notes will mature on, 2026.

Interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the notes will
be payable semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on, 2018. The
Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding

Interest on the notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already
been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Trustee will initially act as Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent for the notes.
The Issuer may change the Registrar, Transfer Agent or Paying Agent without prior notice to the
holders, and Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or
Registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the indenture. The Registrar,
the Transfer Agent and the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of notes.
Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or
exchange any note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or
exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be redeemed.

**Note Guarantees**

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the indenture initially will be jointly and
severally guaranteed by Parent and those of the Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer)
that are obligors or guarantors under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes.

Not all of Parent’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer),
these non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts and their trade creditors
before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. As of December 31, 2017,
these non-guarantor Subsidiaries had an aggregate of $1.4 billion of liabilities outstanding
(excluding intercompany obligations), to which the notes would have been structurally
subordinated.

If any subsidiary of Parent (other than the Issuer) provides a Guarantee of any Indebtedness
of Parent or a Guarantor under any syndicated Credit Facility or Capital Markets Indebtedness,

43


-----

then such Subsidiary will promptly execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to which it will
Guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, the Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the
indenture for so long as the Guarantee in connection with the applicable Indebtedness remains
in place. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Subsidiary shall be required to Guarantee the notes
if any such Guarantee shall be illegal or unenforceable under relevant law (after taking into
account the limitations set forth in the next succeeding paragraph), as determined in good faith
by the Issuer.

The obligations of each Note Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as
necessary to prevent such Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under
applicable law. In addition, the obligations of any Note Guarantor organized outside the United
States of America may be limited as necessary or appropriate to (1) comply with applicable law,
(2) avoid any general legal limitations such as general statutory limitations, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims or similar matters or
(3) avoid a conflict with the fiduciary duties of such company’s directors, contravention of any
legal prohibition or regulatory condition, or the material risk of personal or criminal liability for
any officers or directors (collectively referred to as “Agreed Guarantee Principles”, in each case
as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion). Such limitations could be significant.

A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee and
its obligations under the indenture:

(1) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such
Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other
disposition of all of the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary Guarantor then held by the Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) if such Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or otherwise
ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case in accordance with the provisions of the
indenture, upon effectiveness of such designation or when it first ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary, respectively;

(3) in the case of any Note Guarantee issued on the Issue Date, upon the release or
discharge of the Note Guarantee by such Note Guarantor in respect of the Credit Agreement,
and, in any other case, upon the release or discharge of any Note Guarantee in respect of
Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the Issue Date of the Note Guarantee by such
Subsidiary Guarantor; or

(4) if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or if the obligations of the
Issuer under the indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of the indenture.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of any Note Guarantor, other than a Note Guarantor
organized in the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, under or with
respect to any Note Guarantee by Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor organized other than in
the United States (each such person, a “Payor”) will be made free and clear of any withholding
or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental
charge of whatever nature (collectively, “Tax”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any
jurisdiction in which such Payor is organized, resident or carrying on business for tax purposes
or from or through which such Payor makes any payment on its Note Guarantee or any

44


-----

department or political subdivision of any of the foregoing (each, a “Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction”), unless the Payor (or an applicable withholding agent) is required to withhold or
deduct Taxes by law. For the avoidance of doubt, a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction shall not
include the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia. If the Payor (or an
applicable withholding agent) is required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for or on
account of Taxes of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with
respect to any Note Guarantee, the Payor, subject to the exceptions listed below, will pay
additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
received by each holder or beneficial owner of the notes after such withholding or deduction
(including withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts payable hereunder) will
not be less than the amount the holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes
had not been required to be so withheld or deducted.

A Payor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a holder or beneficial owner of notes:

(a) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been
imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or
beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of a power over, such holder or beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial
owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(other than any connection resulting solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or
disposition of notes, the receipt of payments thereunder or under any Note Guarantee and/
or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any notes or any Note Guarantee);

(b) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been
imposed but for the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of notes, following the Issuer’s
or the Payor’s written request addressed to the holder, to the extent such holder or
beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation
or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption
from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or
beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(c) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, capital gains, excise or
personal property tax or any similar Taxes;

(d) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been
imposed but for the presentation by the holder or beneficial owner of any notes, where
presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which
payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided
for, whichever occurs later;

(e) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been
imposed but for the holder or beneficial owner not dealing at arm’s length, within the
meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada), with such Payor; or

(f) any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).

Additional Amounts also will not be paid with respect to any payment on any Note
Guarantee to a beneficial owner who is a fiduciary, a partnership (or entity treated as a
partnership for tax purposes), or anyone other than the sole beneficial owner of that
payment to the extent that payment would be required by the laws of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with
respect to the fiduciary, a member of that partnership or a beneficial owner who would not

45


-----

have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had that beneficiary, settlor, member or
interest holder been the beneficial owner.

The Payor or applicable withholding agent will (i) make any such withholding or deduction
required by applicable law and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the
relevant authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor, or the applicable withholding
agent, will make reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes. The Payor, or the applicable withholding agent, will provide to the
Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld are due pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy of tax receipts evidencing
such payment, or, if such tax receipts are not reasonably available to the Payor, such other
documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment by the Payor.

Where Tax is payable pursuant to Regulation 803 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) by a
holder or beneficial owner of the notes in respect of any amount payable under any Note
Guarantee to the holder (other than by reason of a transfer of the notes to a person resident in
Canada with whom the transferor does not deal at arm’s length for the purposes of such Act),
but no Additional Amount is paid in respect of such Tax, the Payor will pay as or on account of
interest to the holder an amount equal to such Tax (a “Regulation 803 Reimbursement”) plus an
amount equal to any Tax required to be paid by the holder or beneficial owner as a result of
such Regulation 803 Reimbursement within 45 days after receiving from the holder a notice
containing reasonable particulars of the Tax so payable, provided such holder or beneficial
owner would have been entitled to receive Additional Amounts on account of such Tax (and
only to the extent of such Additional Amounts that such holder or beneficial owner would have
been entitled to receive) but for the fact that it is payable otherwise than by deduction or
withholding from payments made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee.

The Payor will deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable prior to the date on which such payments will be made, and the
amounts so payable, and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee
(or applicable paying agent) to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date.
Any such certificate will be delivered a reasonable amount of time in advance of when the
payments in question are required to be made. The Payor will promptly publish a notice in
accordance with the provisions of the indenture stating that such Additional Amounts will be
payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

The Payors, jointly and severally, will reimburse the holders or beneficial owners of notes,
upon written request of such holder or beneficial owner of notes and certified proof of payment
for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable
by such holder or beneficial owner in connection with payments made under or with respect to
any Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with respect to any reimbursement
under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such holder
or beneficial owner after such reimbursement will not be less than the net amount such holder
or beneficial owner would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the reimbursement described
in clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification
obligation provided for in this paragraph shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the holder
or beneficial owner of the notes would not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional
Amounts hereunder by virtue of clauses (a) through (f) above or to the extent such holder or
beneficial owner received Additional Amounts with respect to such payments.

In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or
other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto,

46


-----

imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect of the execution, issuance,
registration or delivery of any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to
thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
at any time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any payments made pursuant to any Note
Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the
enforcement of any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to
thereunder.

The obligations described under this heading will survive any termination, defeasance or
discharge of the indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, to any
Payor and to any jurisdiction in which such successor is organized (other than the United States,
any state thereof or the District of Columbia), carrying on business or is otherwise resident for
tax purposes or any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia) from or through which payment is made by such successor or its respective agents.
Whenever the indenture or this “Description of the Notes” refers to, in any context, the payment
of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any
note or under any Note Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts
or indemnification payments as described hereunder, if applicable.

to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of notes (including notes issued after the Issue Date, if

Premium plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. The
Issuer shall calculate the redemption price, including any Applicable Premium.

**_Notice of Redemption_**

In connection with any optional redemption of the notes, any such redemption may, at the
Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. If a redemption is subject to

47


-----

satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the applicable redemption notice shall
describe such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied,
without the requirement of an additional notice period to the holders, or such redemption may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with
respect to the notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer
to purchase the notes as described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of the
holders.”

**Other Purchases**

Parent and its Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time attempt to acquire or
acquire notes by means other than a redemption, whether pursuant to an issuer tender offer,
open market purchases or otherwise, assuming such acquisition does not otherwise violate the
terms of the indenture; provided, that this paragraph does not provide the Issuer with any
additional rights to redeem the notes other than as explicitly provided for in the indenture. In
connection with any such acquisition, the Issuer may seek and obtain holders’ consent to
amendments to the indenture.

**Repurchase at the Option of the Holders**

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of notes will have the right to require the Issuer
to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof)
of that holder’s notes pursuant to an offer (the “Change of Control Offer”) on the terms set forth
in the indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest
on the notes repurchased to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control
Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will transmit a notice to
each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice,
which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is
delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture (or in accordance with the
procedures of the depositary) and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the
requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection
with the repurchase of the notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of
the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will
not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
indenture by virtue of such conflict.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

48


-----

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all notes or portions of notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes properly accepted together with
an officers’ certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being
purchased by the Issuer.

The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or transmit by wire transfer) to each holder of notes
properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the Trustee will promptly
authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal
in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that
each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess
thereof.

The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or
redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Change
of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial
purchasers. Management evaluates transactions which could result in a Change of Control from
time to time and may engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control in the future.
Subject to the limitations discussed below, Parent could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect Parent’s capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on the ability of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Incurrence
of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Liens”. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the indenture does not contain any covenants or
provisions that may afford holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes
upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer with respect to the
notes in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in
the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes
properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, (2) notice of redemption
with respect to the notes has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the
caption “—Optional Redemption”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable
redemption price, or (3) after giving effect to such Change of Control, (i) no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the Change of Control transaction has been approved
by the Board of Directors of Parent, and (iii) the notes have received an Investment Grade Rating.
In addition, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control at the time of launching the Change of Control Offer.

The provisions under the indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control (including any required notice period)
may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the notes, including after the entry into of an agreement that would result in the need
to make a Change of Control Offer.

49


-----

With respect to the notes, in the event that holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in a
Change of Control Offer and the Issuer purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, within 60 days of such purchase, the Issuer will have the right, upon
not less than 30 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, to redeem all of the notes that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to, but excluding, the
date of redemption.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale,
lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or
assets of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to
require the Issuer to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition of less than all of the assets of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

**Asset Sales**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an
Asset Sale unless:

(1) Parent (or its Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the
time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (determined, for purposes of this
clause (1), by Parent or, in the case of any asset(s) valued in excess of $750.0 million, by the
Board of Directors) of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration received
in the Asset Sale by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents.

(3) For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as shown on Parent’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of
Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are
by their terms subordinated to the notes and the Note Guarantees) (i) that are assumed by
the transferee of any such assets pursuant to an agreement that releases Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary from further liability or (ii) that are discharged by the transferee in a
transaction pursuant to which neither Parent nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any liability
following such Asset Sale;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by Parent or any such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary
into cash within 180 days after the consummation of the applicable Asset Sale, to the extent
of the cash received in that conversion; and (c) any Designated Noncash Consideration
having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with all other Designated
Noncash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does not exceed at the
time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of
each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of $800.0 million or 3.0%
of Consolidated Total Assets.

50


-----

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Parent or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to those Net Proceeds:

(1) to repay (w) Indebtedness and other Obligations under the Credit Agreement and, if the
Indebtedness repaid under the Credit Agreement is revolving credit Indebtedness, to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, (x) other secured indebtedness,
(y) other Indebtedness which ranks pari passu in right of payment with the notes (provided, in
the case of this clause (y), the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce obligations under the
notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption,” through
privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases (in each case, provided that such
purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof), or by making an offer (in
accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to
purchase, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, the pro rata principal amount of the notes) or (z) other Indebtedness of a
Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) that does not Guarantee the notes, so long as the relevant
assets were assets of such Subsidiary;

(2) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of,
another Permitted Business or the minority interest of any Permitted Business;

(3) to make payments with respect to the acquisition or license of intellectual property
rights that are used in a Permitted Business;

(4) to make a capital expenditure in or that is useful in a Permitted Business;

(5) to retire notes (x) pursuant to the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption,”
(y) through privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases, or (z) by making an
offer to purchase notes in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale
Offer;

(6) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets (for the avoidance of
doubt, including acquisitions of in-process research and development) under GAAP and that are
used or useful in a Permitted Business;

_provided that a binding commitment to apply any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale as set forth_
in clauses (2), (3), (4) or (6) above shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds
from the date of such commitment so long as Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into
such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to
satisfy such commitment within 180 days of the end of such 450-day period (an “Acceptable
Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated
for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary shall be permitted to apply the Net Proceeds in any manner set forth
above before the expiration of such 180-day period and, in the event Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary fails to do so, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined
below).

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will not be required to apply an amount equal to any Net Proceeds in accordance
with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Proceeds from all Asset Sales
which are not applied in accordance with this covenant exceed the greater of $275.0 million or
1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of receipt of such Net Proceeds. Pending
application of an amount equal to Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, Parent or a Restricted

51


-----

Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net
Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the
preceding two paragraphs will constitute “Excess Proceeds”. When the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of $275.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, the
Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of notes and all holders of other
Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in
the indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets
to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness
that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset
Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after
consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use the
amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture. If
the aggregate principal amount of notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such
Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the notes and such other pari passu
Indebtedness will be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are
applicable in connection with each repurchase of notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale
provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale
provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The agreements governing Parent’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other Indebtedness,
including any Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, may contain prohibitions of certain
events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale. In addition,
the exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the
notes upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale may cause a default under these other
agreements, even if the Change of Control or Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchases on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of
notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes
if it experiences a change of control”.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer elects to redeem less than all of the notes at any time, the notes will be selected
for redemption as follows:

(1) in accordance with the procedures of DTC and in compliance with the requirements of
the applicable stock exchange to the extent the notes are held in the form of Global Notes; or

(2) on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate
to the extent the notes are held in definitive form.

No notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by
first class mail to holders of certificated notes (or otherwise transmitted to registered holders of

52


-----

global notes in accordance with applicable procedures of the depositary) at least 30 but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of notes to be redeemed at its
registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the indenture.

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note
will state the portion of the principal amount of that note that is to be redeemed. A new note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the
name of the holder of notes upon cancellation of the original note. Notes called for redemption
become due on the date fixed for redemption.

On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of them
called for redemption.

**Certain Covenants**

**Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade**

In the event of the occurrence of a Fall Away Event (and notwithstanding the failure of
Parent subsequently to maintain an Investment Grade Rating), the covenants and provisions
described below under the captions:

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(4) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”; and

(6) clause (4) of the covenant described under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”

shall each no longer be in effect for the remaining term of the notes.

**Restricted Payments**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of
Parent’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any
payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving Parent or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of Parent’s or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions
payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent or to Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent);

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation,
in connection with any merger or consolidation involving Parent) any Equity Interests of Parent
or any direct or indirect parent of Parent;

53


-----

(3) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled
maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Note Guarantor that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the notes
or a Note Guarantee, except (i) from Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent or (ii) the
purchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of any such Indebtedness
made in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final
maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such purchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being
collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect
to such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a
consequence of such Restricted Payment;

(2) Parent would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect
thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable fourquarter period, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described
below under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”; and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries after January 30, 2015 (excluding
Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (11), (12) and (13) of the
next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of Parent for the period (taken as one
accounting period) from October 1, 2014 to the end of Parent’s most recently ended fiscal
quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted
Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such
deficit), plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds (or the fair market value of assets)
received by Parent since January 30, 2015 as a contribution to its common equity capital or
from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of Parent (other than Disqualified Stock) or from
the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or convertible or
exchangeable debt securities of Parent that have been converted into or exchanged for such
Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to
a Subsidiary of Parent), plus

(c) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after January 30, 2015 is
sold for cash or otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash, the lesser of (i) the cash return of
capital with respect to such Restricted Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any) or
(ii) the initial amount of such Restricted Investment, plus

(d) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Parent is redesignated as a
Restricted Subsidiary after January 30, 2015, the lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of
Parent’s Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation or (ii) such Fair
Market Value as of the date on which such Subsidiary was originally designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, plus

(e) $3.7 billion.

54


-----

As of December 31, 2017, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to clause
(3) above would have been approximately $10.7 billion.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend,
if at the date of declaration the dividend payment would have complied with the provisions of
the indenture (it being understood that the amount of any such dividend shall be included in the
aggregate amount of Restricted Payments determined in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph
only once and not as separate Restricted Payments made at both declaration and payment);

(2) any Restricted Payment made in exchange for, or in an amount equal to the net cash
proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale (other than to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of
Parent) of, Equity Interests of Parent (other than Disqualified Stock); provided that an amount
equal to such Restricted Payment will be excluded from clause (3)(b) of the preceding
paragraph;

(3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase or other acquisition or retirement of
subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor with the net cash proceeds
from, or in exchange for, an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) the payment of any dividend or any other payment or distribution by a Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent to the holders of its Equity Interests of any class on a pro rata basis to
holders of such class;

(5) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the repurchase,
redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of Equity Interests of Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary of Parent held by any present or former employee, director, officer or
consultant of, or service provider to, Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any
management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit
plan or agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any principal and interest payable on
any notes issued by Parent in connection with any such repurchase, retirement or other
acquisition), or any stock subscription or shareholder agreement; provided that the aggregate
amount of Restricted Payments made under this clause (5) shall not exceed in any calendar year
$25.0 million (with unused amounts for any year being carried over to the next succeeding year,
but not to any subsequent year, with the permitted amount for each year being used prior to
any amount carried over from the previous year); provided further that such amount in any
calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed:

(i) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies received by Parent or its
Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date; less

(ii) the amount of any Restricted Payments previously made with the cash proceeds
described in subclause (i) of this clause (5);

(6) payments to holders of Equity Interests (or to the holders of Indebtedness that is
convertible into or exchangeable for Equity Interests upon such conversion or exchange) in lieu
of the issuance of fractional shares;

(7) repurchases of Equity Interests deemed to occur in connection with the exercise or
vesting of stock options or similar instruments to the extent necessary to pay withholding or
similar taxes related to such exercise or vesting of stock options or similar instruments;

55


-----

(8) [reserved];

(9) repurchases or retirement for value of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon exercise of
stock options or warrants if such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of
such options or warrants;

(10) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any
subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock pursuant to provisions similar to those
described under the captions “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and
“Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”; provided that, prior thereto, all notes
tendered by holders in connection with a Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as
applicable, have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value;

(11) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
declaration and payment of dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of
Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries issued in accordance with the covenant described under the
caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(12) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, other
Restricted Payments; provided, however, that if the Total Leverage Ratio as of the date of any
Restricted Payment to be made pursuant to this clause (12) is greater than or equal to 3.50 to
1.0, such Restricted Payment shall be permitted to be made pursuant to this clause (12) only if
the amount of such Restricted Payment, when taken together with the amount of all other
Restricted Payments previously made pursuant to this clause (12) when the Total Leverage Ratio
was greater than or equal to 3.50 to 1.0, does not exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate; and

(13) the distribution, as a dividend or otherwise, of shares of Capital Stock of, or
Indebtedness owed to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary by, Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value
(determined, for purposes of this covenant, by Parent or, in the case of any asset(s) valued in
excess of $750.0 million, by the Board of Directors) on the date of the Restricted Payment of the
asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. For purposes of
determining compliance with this “Restricted Payments” covenant, in the event that a Restricted
Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through
(13) above, including the first paragraph of this covenant or the definition of “Permitted
Investment,” the Issuer will be permitted to classify such Restricted Payment and later reclassify
all or a portion of such Restricted Payment in any manner that complies with this covenant. In
addition, a Restricted Payment need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Restricted Payment but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in
part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Restricted Payment.

As of December 31, 2017, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to clause
(5) above would have been approximately $50 million.

**Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly
liable, contingently or otherwise (collectively, “incur”), with respect to any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Debt), and Parent will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit

56


-----

any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock; provided,
however, that Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired
Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue preferred stock if the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Parent’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would
have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application
of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of
such four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following
items of Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under Credit
Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not
to exceed $2,500.0 million;

(2) the incurrence by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness,
including the Existing Secured Notes;

(3) the incurrence by the Issuer and the Note Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by
the notes to be issued on the date of the indenture and the Note Guarantees (including any
future Note Guarantees);

(4) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness
represented by Capital Lease Obligations in an aggregate amount, including all Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed the greater of (x) $275.0 million and (y) 1.0% of
Consolidated Total Assets at any time outstanding;

(5) mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case, incurred for the
purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or
improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary of Parent, in an aggregate principal amount, including all Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to this clause (5), not to exceed the greater of (x) $675.0 million and (y) 2.5% of
Consolidated Total Assets at any time outstanding;

(6) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or
replace, Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the
indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clauses (2), (3), (12) or
(14) of this paragraph or this clause (6) or, solely to the extent of the excess (if any) of the
amount of Indebtedness incurred and outstanding under clause (20) prior to the applicable
refinancing over the maximum aggregate amount permitted to be incurred and outstanding
under clause (20) at the time of such refinancing, clause (20) of this paragraph;

57


-----

(7) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany
Indebtedness between or among Parent and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Note Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the obligee
is not the Issuer or another Note Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be expressly
subordinated (without regard to security interest) to the prior payment in full in cash of all
Obligations with respect to the notes; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such
Indebtedness being held by a Person other than Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent
and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not Parent or
a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence
of such Indebtedness by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that is
not permitted by this clause (7);

(8) (i) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations
that are incurred and not for speculative purposes and (ii) the incurrence by a Securitization
Special Purpose Entity of Indebtedness in a Qualified Securitization Transaction that is without
recourse to the Parent or to any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent or their assets (other
than Standard Securitization Undertakings);

(9) the Guarantee by Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent of Indebtedness of Parent
or any Restricted Subsidiary that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this
covenant (other than the Note Guarantees); provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed
is subordinated to or pari passu with the notes or any Note Guarantee, then the Guarantee shall
be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed (without regard to security
interest);

(10) the accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the
payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same
terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of
the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or
an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case,
that the amount thereof is included in Fixed Charges of Parent as accrued;

(11) obligations in respect of performance and surety bonds and completion guarantees or
similar obligations provided by Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent in each case in the
normal course of business (whether or not consistent with past practice);

(12) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Acquired Debt;
provided, however, that on the date of acquisition and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma
basis, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of Parent (A) would be at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would be
equal to or greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such
acquisition;

(13) the incurrence by any Foreign Subsidiary of Indebtedness in an aggregate principal
amount at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to
refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (13), not to
exceed the greater of (x) $675.0 million or (y) 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets;

(14) Indebtedness of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred in connection with or in
contemplation of, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to

58


-----

consummate, the acquisition by Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent of property used
or useful in a Permitted Business (whether through the direct purchase of assets or the purchase
of Capital Stock of, or merger or consolidation with, any Person owning such assets); provided,
however, on the date of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of Parent (A) would be at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would be equal to
or greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such incurrence;

(15) Indebtedness incurred by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries constituting
reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of
business, including letters of credit in respect of workers’ compensation claims, death, disability
or other employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance, or other
Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement-type obligations regarding workers’ compensation
claims; provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or the incurrence of
such Indebtedness, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing or
incurrence;

(16) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a
check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds, provided that such
Indebtedness is extinguished within five business days of notice of its incurrence;

(17) Indebtedness of Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries supported by a letter of
credit issued pursuant to the Credit Facilities, in a principal amount not in excess of the stated
amount of such letter of credit;

(18) Indebtedness of Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries consisting of (i) the
financing of insurance premiums or (ii) take-or-pay or similar obligations contained in supply
arrangements, in each case, incurred in the ordinary course of business;

(19) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness
in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding,
including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (19), not to exceed the greater of (x)
$675.0 million and (y) 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets; and

(20) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness secured
by a Lien under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount such that, on a pro forma
basis (including a pro forma application of the proceeds therefrom), the Secured Leverage Ratio
would not exceed 3.50 to 1.00.

Parent and the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Note Guarantor to, incur any
Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment
to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Note Guarantors unless such Indebtedness is also
contractually subordinated in right of payment to the notes on substantially identical terms;
provided, however, that no Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Note Guarantors will be deemed to
be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Note Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or having a junior lien priority.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Preferred Stock” covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses
(1) through (20) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, Parent will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its

59


-----

incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that
complies with this covenant. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted
solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part
by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting
such Indebtedness. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the date on which
notes are first issued and authenticated under the indenture will be deemed to have been
incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (20) of the definition of
Permitted Debt.

In addition, for purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Preferred Stock” covenant, Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may
elect to treat all or any portion of the commitment under any Indebtedness (including with
respect to any revolving loan commitment) as being incurred at the time of such commitment,
in which case any subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness under such commitment shall not be
deemed to be an incurrence at such subsequent time.

**Liens**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness of any kind on
any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, except Permitted Liens, unless contemporaneously
therewith:

(1) in the case of any Lien securing Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the notes or a
Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the notes or such Note Guarantee, as the
case may be, equally and ratably with or prior to such obligation with a Lien on the same assets
of Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be; and

(2) in the case of any Lien securing Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to
the notes or a Note Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the notes or such Note
Guarantee, as the case may be, with a Lien on the same assets of Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, that is prior to the Lien securing such subordinated obligation.

Any Lien created for the benefit of holders pursuant to this covenant shall be automatically
and unconditionally released and discharged, without any action on the part of the holders,
upon the release and discharge of each of the Liens described in clauses (1) and (2) above.

**Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not the Issuer to,
directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance
or restriction on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to Parent or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or pay any indebtedness owed to Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(2) make loans or advances to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(3) transfer any of its properties or assets to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

60


-----

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing
under or by reason of:

(1) agreements, including agreements governing Existing Indebtedness, as in effect on the
date of the indenture and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the
amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not more materially
restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than
those contained in those agreements on the date of the indenture;

(2) the indenture, the notes and the Note Guarantees;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Credit Facilities incurred under clause (1) or
(20) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(4) applicable law, rule, regulation or order, approval, license, permit or similar restriction,
including under contracts with foreign governments or agencies thereof entered into in the
ordinary course of business;

(5) any instrument governing Indebtedness, Capital Stock or assets of a Person acquired by
Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to
the extent such Indebtedness was incurred, or such Capital Stock was issued, in connection with
or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to
any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or
assets of the Person, so acquired, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals,
increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements
provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not
materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment
restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the date of the acquisition; provided
that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the
indenture to be incurred;

(6) customary non-assignment provisions in leases, contracts and licenses entered into in
the ordinary course of business;

(7) purchase money obligations for property that impose restrictions on that property of the
nature described in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

(8) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts
distributions, transfers, loans or advances by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other
disposition;

(9) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the
agreements governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not, in the good faith
judgment of the Issuer, materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in
the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

61


-----

(10) Permitted Liens securing Indebtedness that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of
the assets subject to such Liens;

(11) customary provisions in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale
agreements and other similar agreements entered into with the approval of the Board of
Directors of Parent or otherwise in the ordinary course of business;

(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(13) restrictions in agreements or instruments which prohibit the payment or making of
dividends or other distributions other than on a pro rata basis;

(14) contractual requirements of a Securitization Special Purpose Entity in connection with a
Qualified Securitization Transaction; provided that such restrictions apply only to such
Securitization Special Purpose Entity; and

(15) any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness or preferred stock permitted to
be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,” which encumbrances or
restrictions (i) are not, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, materially more restrictive, taken
as a whole, than those contained in the indenture or (ii) will not, in the good faith judgment of
the Issuer, affect the ability of the Issuer to make anticipated payments of principal, interest or
premium on the notes.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets**

Parent and the Issuer may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate, amalgamate, or merge
with or into another Person (whether or not Parent or the Issuer is the surviving corporation); or
(2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties
or assets of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one or more related
transactions, to another Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) Parent or the Issuer is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by
or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, or merger (if other than Parent or the
Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been
made is organized and validly existing under the laws of the U.S., any state of the U.S. or the
District of Columbia or under the laws of Canada or any province thereof, any member state of
the European Union as in effect on the Issue Date, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, any Channel
Island or Switzerland (provided that, in the case of the Issuer, if such entity is not a corporation,
a co-obligor of the notes is a corporation);

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, or merger (if
other than Parent or the Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition has been made expressly assumes all the obligations of Parent
or the Issuer, as applicable, under the notes (or the Note Guarantee) and the indenture pursuant
to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(4) in the case of Parent, either (a) Parent or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, amalgamation, or merger (if other than Parent) or to which such sale,

62


-----

assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made will, on the date of such
transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the
same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur
at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set
forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption “—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”, or (b) Parent or the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation amalgamation, or merger (if other than Parent) or to which
such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made would, on the
date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period,
have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries that would
be equal to or greater than such ratio for such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries
immediately prior to such action.

In addition, Parent may not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of its
properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.

Parent will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate,
amalgamate, or merge with or into another Person; or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or
otherwise dispose (collectively “dispose”) of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in
one or more related transactions, to another Person unless:

(1) except in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor (x) that has disposed of all or substantially
all of its assets, whether through a merger, amalgamation, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock
or assets or (y) that, as a result of the disposition of all or a portion of its Capital Stock, ceases to
be a Subsidiary of Parent, in both cases in compliance with the covenant described under
“Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person (if not such Subsidiary Guarantor) shall expressly assume, by a guarantee agreement in
a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee; and

(2) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists.

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or
amalgamate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or
any Note Guarantor and (B) Parent or the Issuer may merge or amalgamate with an Affiliate of
Parent solely for the purpose of reincorporating Parent or the Issuer in another jurisdiction
within the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, Canada or any
province thereof, any member state of the European Union as in effect on the Issue Date,
Bermuda, Cayman Islands, any Channel Island, Singapore or Switzerland or converting Parent
or the Issuer into a limited liability company organized under the United States of America, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province thereof, any member state of
the European Union as in effect on the Issue Date, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, any Channel
Island, Singapore or Switzerland (provided that, in the case of the Issuer, a co-obligor of the
notes is a corporation).

**Transactions with Affiliates**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment
to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase
any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract,

63


-----

agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate
(each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of
$100.0 million, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person, as
determined by the Issuer in good faith; and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
involving aggregate consideration in excess of $750.0 million, such Affiliate Transaction has
been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Parent.

The following items will be deemed not to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not
be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any employment agreement or benefit or similar plan entered into by Parent or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business of Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary;

(2) transactions between or among Parent and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(3) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of Parent solely because Parent owns,
directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;

(4) the payment of reasonable compensation and fees to, and the provision of customary
indemnities to, current or former officers, directors, employees or consultants of Parent or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) issuances or sales of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent to
Affiliates or employees of or consultants to Parent;

(6) Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the indenture described
above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” and Permitted Investments;

(7) transactions effected pursuant to agreements in effect on the date of the indenture and
any amendment, modification or replacement to such agreement (so long the as amendment,
modification or replacement is not, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, materially more
disadvantageous to Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, taken as a whole, than the terms of
those agreements in effect on the date of the indenture);

(8) [reserved];

(9) transactions with a Permitted Joint Venture in which Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
holds or acquires an ownership interest (whether by way of Capital Stock or otherwise) so long
as the terms of any such transactions, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, are not
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary than they are
to other joint venture partners;

(10) any agreement that grants registration and other customary rights in connection
therewith or otherwise to the direct or indirect securityholders of Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary (and the performance of such agreements);

64


-----

(11) transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or Capital
Stock of Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, where such Affiliates receive the same
consideration as non-Affiliates in such transactions;

(12) transactions affected as part of a Qualified Securitization Transaction; and

(13) transactions in which Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers
to the Trustee a copy of a letter from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of
national standing addressed to the Company stating that such transaction meets the
requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph.

**Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Initially, all of Parent’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the indenture and will not
Guarantee the notes. Following the Issue Date, Parent’s Board of Directors may designate any
Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. Any designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
deemed to be a designation of each of such entity’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
Following the Issue Date, if a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary,
the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Parent and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount
available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption
“—Restricted Payments” or under one or more of the clauses of the definition of Permitted
Investments, as determined by Parent. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment
would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition
of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Parent’s Board of Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default;
provided that such redesignation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness and, if
applicable, an incurrence of related Liens by a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent of any
outstanding Indebtedness and, if applicable, related Liens of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and
such redesignation will only be permitted if such Indebtedness and, if applicable, related Liens
are permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and, if applicable, “—Certain
Covenants—Liens” (other than clause (3) under the definition of Permitted Liens), calculated, if
applicable, on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the
four-quarter reference period.

**Business Activities**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any
business other than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as would not be material to
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**Reports**

Whether or not required by the SEC’s rules and regulations, so long as any notes are
outstanding, Parent will furnish (to the extent not publicly available on the SEC’s EDGAR

65


-----

system) to the holders of notes and post on Parent’s website (in a format that is accessible to
holders of notes as well as prospective holders of notes), within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and regulations:

(1) all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms
10-Q and 10-K if Parent were required to file such reports; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if Parent
were required to file such reports.

All such reports will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules
and regulations applicable to such reports (other than consolidating financial information
required by Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of Regulation S-X or any comparable provision so long as the
Issuer complies with the second to last paragraph of this “—Reports” covenant). Each annual
report on Form 10-K will include a report on Parent’s consolidated financial statements by
Parent’s independent registered public accountants. In addition, Parent will file a copy of each of
the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above with the SEC for public availability within the
time periods specified in the rules and regulations applicable to such reports (unless the SEC
will not accept such a filing or Parent is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act for any reason) and make such information available to securities analysts
and prospective investors upon request.

If, at any time, Parent is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act for any reason, and regardless of whether it continues to file reports with the SEC,
Parent will nevertheless continue making the reports specified in the preceding paragraph
available to the holders of notes, prospective investors and securities analysts by posting such
information on its website.

While Parent remains subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act,
Parent agrees that it will not take any action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept
any such filings. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept Parent’s filings for
any reason, Parent will post the reports referred to in the preceding paragraph on its website
within the time periods that would apply if Parent were required to file those reports with the
SEC.

In addition, Parent agrees that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding, at any time it is
not required to file the reports required by the preceding paragraphs with the SEC, it will furnish
to the holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraphs will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements, in the
footnotes of the financial statements or in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, that discloses the total assets, liabilities, revenues and
income from operations of subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the notes.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent fails to comply
with its obligation to file or provide such information, documents and reports as required
hereunder, Parent will be deemed to have cured such Default with respect to the notes for
purposes of clause (4) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” upon the filing or provision of
all such information, documents and reports required hereunder prior to the expiration of 90
days after written notice to Parent of such failure from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25%
of the principal amount of the notes.

66


-----

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an Event of Default with respect to the notes:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the notes;

(2) default in the payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the notes;

(3) failure by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (a) to comply with the provisions
described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”, which failure remains
uncured for 30 days after written notice to the Issuer from the Trustee or to the Issuer and the
Trustee from the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the notes, or (b) to comply with
the provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or
Sale of Assets”;

(4) failure by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days (or 90 days in the case
of the provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports”) after written notice to the
Issuer from the Trustee or to the Issuer and the Trustee from the holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the notes to comply with any of the other agreements in the indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued
or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by
Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists or is
created after the date of the indenture, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal when due on such Indebtedness within any
applicable grace period provided in such Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity; and, in
each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or
the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $250.0 million or more;

(6) failure by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final non-appealable
judgments aggregating in excess of $250.0 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged,
stayed or subject to insurance for a period of 60 days after becoming final;

(7) any Note Guarantee by Parent or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and
effect in all material respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or Parent or any
Note Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms such Note Guarantor’s
obligations under the indenture or any Note Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days
after receipt of the notice as specified in the indenture; or

(8) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation described in the indenture with
respect to Parent, the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, when taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency
with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately
without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default with respect to the notes occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then
outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately.

67


-----

Holders of the notes may not enforce the indenture or the notes except as provided in the
indenture. Subject to certain limitations, including the right to be indemnified, holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may direct the Trustee
with respect to the notes in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from
holders of the notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or
Event of Default in the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice
is in their interest.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by
written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the notes waive any existing
Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing
Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, the notes.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance
with the indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**Foreign Currency Equivalents**

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction or
amount, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of any amount denominated in a foreign
currency will be the Dollar Equivalent calculated on the date the Indebtedness was incurred or
other transaction was entered into; provided that if any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars is incurred to refinance Indebtedness
denominated in the same currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such refinancing,
such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness shall be deemed not to exceed the principal amount
of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision in the indenture,
no restriction or amount will be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate
of currencies. In no event, will the Trustee or the Paying Agent be responsible for obtaining
exchange rates or otherwise effecting currency conversions or calculations.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Note Guarantors domiciled outside the U.S. will irrevocably appoint Valeant
Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, 400 Somerset Corporate Boulevard, Bridgewater, New
Jersey 08807, as their agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect
to the indenture, the notes and the Note Guarantees brought in any Federal or state court
located in New York City and each of such parties will submit to the jurisdiction thereof.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Note
Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Note
Guarantor under the notes, the indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of notes by accepting a note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of
the notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities
laws.

68


-----

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its and the Note
Guarantors’ obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding notes and the related Note
Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of the principal
of, or interest or premium, if any, on, the notes when such payments are due from the trust
referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes,
registration of notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office
or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the
Issuer and the Note Guarantors with respect to the notes released with respect to certain
covenants that are described in the indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any
omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default with respect to the notes
or an Event of Default. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including
non-payment or bankruptcy or insolvency events with respect to Parent of the Issuer) described
under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with
respect to the notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as to the notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the
holders of the notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, or a
combination of cash in U.S. dollars and U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, in
each case in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest and premium, if any, on, the
outstanding notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may
be, and the Issuer must specify whether the notes are being defeased to maturity or to a
particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from,
or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of the
indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case
to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the beneficial
owners of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case
if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the
outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes

69


-----

as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes may have occurred and be
continuing, on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from
the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance must not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the
indenture) to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound; and

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel,
each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs with respect to the notes,
(a) the indenture or the notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, the notes), and (b) any existing Default or compliance with any provision of the indenture or
the notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of
the then outstanding notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with
a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes).

Without the consent of each holder of the notes affected thereby, an amendment or waiver
may not (with respect to any notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of the notes whose holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the provisions
with respect to the redemption of the notes (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, provisions
relating to the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any note;

(4) make any such note payable in money other than U.S. dollars;

(5) make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults
or the rights of holders of notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium, if
any, on notes;

(6) waive a redemption payment with respect to any note (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, a payment required by one of the covenants described above under the caption
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(7) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect
to the notes;

70


-----

(8) modify the Note Guarantees with respect to the notes in any manner adverse to the
holders of the notes; or

(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

In addition, except as set forth under “—Note Guarantees,” without the consent of holders
of at least 66 2/3% in principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, notes), no amendment or supplement may release the Note Guarantees of Parent with
respect to the notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of notes, the Issuer and
the Trustee may amend or supplement the indenture or the notes:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Note Guarantor’s obligations to
holders of notes in the case of a consolidation or merger or sale of all or substantially all of the
Issuer’s or a Note Guarantor’s assets;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders
of notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the indenture of any such
holder;

(5) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of
the indenture under the TIA;

(6) to conform the text of the indenture, the notes or the Note Guarantees to any provision
of this “Description of the Notes;”

(7) to provide for the issuance of additional notes in accordance with the limitations set
forth in the indenture as of its date; or

(8) to add additional Note Guarantees with respect to the notes or to confirm and evidence
the release, termination or discharge of any Note Guarantee with respect to the notes when
such release, termination or discharge is permitted under the indenture.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect, and the Note
Guarantees will be released without any further action by holders, when:

(1) either:

(a) all notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed notes that
have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in
trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation;
or

(b) all notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become
due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will

71


-----

become due and payable within one year and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the
holders of notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable U.S. dollar-denominated Government
Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable U.S. dollardenominated Government Securities, in each case in amounts as will be sufficient without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness
on the notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and
accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption, provided that with respect to any
redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited
shall be sufficient for purpose of the indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited
with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any Applicable Premium deficit only required to be deposited with the
Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption;

(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the notes
on the date of the deposit or will occur as a result of the deposit and the deposit will not result
in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the
Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer is bound, and as to which the rights of the other parties
thereto are senior to those of the holders;

(3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it with respect to the notes
under the indenture; and

(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the indenture to
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or the redemption date,
as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel to the
Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer, the indenture limits its right to obtain
payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within
90 days or resign.

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes will have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any
remedy available to the Trustee with respect to the notes, subject to certain exceptions. The
indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be
required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the
conduct of such person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request of any
holder of notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity
satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including attorney’s
fees and expenses).

The Trustee shall not be responsible to make any calculation with respect to any matter
under the indenture.

72


-----

**Governing Law**

The indenture, the notes and the guarantees will be governed by the laws of the State of
New York.

**Additional Information**

Anyone who receives this offering memorandum may obtain a copy of the indenture
without charge by writing to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., 400 Somerset
Corporate Boulevard, Bridgewater, NJ 08807, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

**Book-Entry, Delivery and Form**

The notes will be represented by one or more notes in registered global form, without
interest coupons attached. On the date of closing, these global notes (the “Global Notes”) will
remain in the custody of the Trustee and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each
case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below.

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part,
only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. In addition, transfers
of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures
of DTC and its direct or indirect participants, including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and
Clearstream, which may change from time to time. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may
not be exchanged for notes in certificated form except in the limited circumstances described
below. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes”.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures
are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by
them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges
investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “participants”) and to facilitate the
clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between participants through
electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants. The participants include securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other
organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect participants”). Persons who
are not participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through
the participants or the indirect participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of
ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of
the participants and indirect participants.

DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants with
portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

73


-----

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of
ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with
respect to the participants) or by the participants and the indirect participants (with respect to
other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests
therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Global Notes who are not participants may hold
their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream)
which are participants in such system. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the
Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their
respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./
N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those
held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of
DTC.

Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the
procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain
Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that
extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to
pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate
evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes
registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will
not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any
purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note
registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the
registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the
Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are
registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the
Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating
to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect
participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or
indirect participants.

DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect
of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the
relevant participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it
will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant participant is credited with an
amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the
relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants and the indirect

74


-----

participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and
customary practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants
and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the
Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its participants in identifying the beneficial
owners of the notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be
protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s
procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Cross-market transfers between the participants in DTC, on the one hand, and DTC
participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be
effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of DTC participants acting on
behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be; however, such cross-market
transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may
be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within
the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the
DTC participant acting on its behalf to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by
delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving
payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to
DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to
the DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the
interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. However, if there is an Event of Default, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes for notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such
procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the
Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for definitive notes in registered certificated form, or
“Certificated Notes,” if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the
Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and,
in either case, the Issuer fails to appoint a successor depositary; or

(2) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default.

75


-----

In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial
interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved
denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary
procedures), and the Certificated Notes shall bear appropriate legends indicating the transfer
restrictions applicable thereto.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

The Issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes
(including principal, premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the accounts specified by the Global Note holder. The Issuer will make all payments of
principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes,
in the case of a holder holding an aggregate principal amount of notes of $1.0 million or more,
or, if no such account is specified or in the case of a holder holding an aggregate principal
amount of notes of less than $1.0 million, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered
address. The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s
Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in
such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The
Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in
immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited,
and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant,
during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear
and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised the Issuer
that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note
by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received
with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or
Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following
DTC’s settlement date.

(c) accrued interest paid on the date of redemption.

The Issuer shall determine the Applicable Premium.

“Asset Sale” means:

not by the provisions of the Asset Sale covenant; and

(2) the issuance of Equity Interests by any of Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries or the sale of
Equity Interests in any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case other than directors’ qualifying
shares.

Notwithstanding the preceding, none of the following items will be deemed to be an Asset
Sale:

Market Value of less than $100.0 million;

(2) a transfer of assets between or among Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(11) sales, transfers or other dispositions of assets for consideration at least equal to the
Fair Market Value of the assets sold or disposed of, but only if the consideration received
consists of property or assets (other than cash, except to the extent used as a bona fide means
of equalizing the value of the property or assets involved in the swap transaction; provided,
however, that cash does not exceed 10% of the sum of the amount of the cash and the Fair
Market Value of the assets received or given) of a nature or type that are used in a business
having property or assets of a nature or type or engaged in a Permitted Business (or Capital
Stock of a Person whose assets consist of assets of the type described in this clause (11)).

“Attributable Debt” in respect of a sale and leaseback transaction means, at the time of
determination, the present value of the obligation of the lessee for net rental payments during
the remaining term of the lease included in such sale and leaseback transaction including any
period for which such lease has been extended or may, at the option of the lessor, be extended.

deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such “person” has the right to
acquire by conversion or exercise of other securities, whether such right is currently exercisable
or is exercisable only after the passage of time. The terms “Beneficially Owns” and “Beneficially
Owned” have a corresponding meaning.

preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments”. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would
fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to
be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the indenture and any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent as of such date
and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant
described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of

**UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following are certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of
notes purchased in this offering at the “issue price,” which is the first price at which a
substantial amount of the notes is sold to the public (not including bond houses, brokers or
similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers), and held as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in
light of your particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax and Medicare
contribution tax consequences, as well as differing tax consequences that may apply if you are,
for instance:

   - a financial institution;

   - a regulated investment company;

   - a dealer or trader in securities that uses a mark-to-market method of accounting;

   - holding notes as part of a “straddle” or integrated transaction;

   - a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

   - a tax-exempt entity;

   - a person required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to conform the timing of income
accruals with respect to the notes to their financial statements; or

   - a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of your partners will generally depend on the status of the partners and your
activities.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended to the date
hereof, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed
Treasury Regulations, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this offering
memorandum may affect the tax consequences described herein. This summary does not
address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. taxation, or any taxes other than income taxes.
You should consult your tax adviser with regard to the application of the U.S. federal tax laws to
your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state,
local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

**Certain Additional Payments**

There are circumstances in which we might be required to make payments on a note that
would increase the yield of the note, as described under Description of Notes—Repurchase at
the Option of the Holders—Change of Control. We intend to take the position that the possibility
of such payments does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt
instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is not binding on the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). If the IRS takes a contrary position, you may be required to
accrue interest income based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury
Regulations) determined at the time of issuance of the notes (which is not expected to differ
significantly from the actual yield on the notes), with adjustments to such accruals when any
contingent payments are made that differ from the payments based on the comparable yield. In
addition, any income on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes

99


-----

would be treated as interest income rather than as capital gain. You should consult your tax
adviser regarding the tax consequences if the notes were treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as
contingent payment debt instruments.

**Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

This section applies to you if you are a U.S. Holder. You are a U.S. Holder if for U.S. federal
income tax purposes you are a beneficial owner of a note and are:

   - a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

   - a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or

   - an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
regardless of its source.

_Payments of Interest_

Stated interest on a note will be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at the time it
accrues or is received, in accordance with your method of accounting for federal income tax
purposes. It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will be issued without
original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_

Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a note, you will recognize taxable gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or other taxable disposition and
your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note will generally equal the
cost of your note. For these purposes, the amount realized does not include any amount
attributable to accrued interest, which is treated as described under “Payments of Interest”
above.

Gain or loss realized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a note will generally be
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale or other
taxable disposition the note has been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains
recognized by non-corporate taxpayers are subject to reduced tax rates. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

This section applies to you if you are a Non-U.S. Holder. You are a Non-U.S. Holder if for
U.S. federal income tax purposes you are a beneficial owner of a note that is:

   - a nonresident alien individual;

   - a foreign corporation; or

   - a foreign estate or trust.

You are not a Non-U.S. Holder if you are a nonresident alien individual present in the United
States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition, or if you are a former citizen or
former resident of the United States, in either of which cases you should consult your tax adviser
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning or disposing of a note.

_Payments on the Notes_

Subject to the discussion below under “FATCA,” payments of principal and interest on the
notes by the Company or any paying agent to you will not be subject to U.S. federal income or
withholding tax, provided that, in the case of interest,

   - you do not own, actually or constructively, ten percent or more of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock of the Company entitled to vote;

   - you are not a controlled foreign corporation related, directly or indirectly, to the
Company through stock ownership;

   - you certify on a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, under
penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person; and

   - it is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States as described below.

If you cannot satisfy one of the first three requirements described above and interest on the
notes is not exempt from withholding because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a
trade or business in the United States as described below, payments of interest on the notes
will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 30%, or the rate specified by an applicable treaty.

_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_

You generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on gain realized
on a sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of notes, unless the gain is effectively
connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States as described below,
although any amounts attributable to accrued interest will be treated as described above under
“Payments on the Notes.”

_Effectively Connected Income_

If interest or gain on a note is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business
in the United States, you will generally be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. Holder (see “Tax
Consequences to U.S. Holders” above) unless an applicable income tax treaty provides
otherwise. In this case, you will be exempt from the withholding tax on interest discussed
above, although you will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8 in order to
claim an exemption from withholding. You should consult your tax adviser with respect to other
U.S. tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of notes, including the possible
imposition of a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) if you are a
corporation.

**Backup Withholding and Information Reporting**

If you are a U.S. Holder, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in
connection with payments on the notes and proceeds received from a sale or other disposition
of the notes unless you are an exempt recipient. You may also be subject to backup withholding
on these payments in respect of your notes unless you provide your taxpayer identification
number and otherwise comply with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules or
you provide proof of an applicable exemption.

If you are Non-U.S. Holder, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in
connection with payments of interest on the notes. Unless you comply with certification

101


-----

procedures to establish that you are not a United States person, information returns may also
be filed with the IRS in connection with the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a note.
You may be subject to backup withholding on payments on the notes or on the proceeds from a
sale or other disposition of the notes unless you comply with certification procedures to
establish that you are not a United States person or otherwise establish an exemption. The
certification procedures required to claim the exemption from withholding tax on interest
described above will satisfy the certification requirements necessary to avoid backup
withholding as well.

Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be
refunded or credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**FATCA**

Provisions commonly referred to as “FATCA” impose withholding of 30% on payments of
interest on the notes and (for dispositions after December 31, 2018) of proceeds of sales or
redemptions of the notes to “foreign financial institutions” (which is broadly defined for this
purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities
(whether such foreign financial institutions or other non-U.S. entities are beneficial owners or
intermediaries) unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements
(generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities)
have been satisfied, or an exemption applies. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial
owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally will be entitled to a refund of any
amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant
administrative burden). Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the
effects of FATCA on their investment in the notes.

**CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following summary describes the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations
generally applicable, as of the date hereof, to a purchaser who acquires, as beneficial owner,
notes, including entitlement to all payments (including any interest and principal) thereunder,
pursuant to this offering memorandum and who, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) and the regulations thereunder (collectively, the “Tax Act”) and at all relevant times,
deals at arm’s length with the Issuer, each Note Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers (a
“holder”).

This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Tax Act, and the Issuer’s
Canadian legal counsel’s understanding of the current administrative practices and assessing
policies of the Canada Revenue Agency published in writing by it prior to the date hereof. This
summary takes into account all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act publicly announced by
or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (the “Tax Proposals”)
and assumes that all Tax Proposals will be enacted in the form proposed. However, no
assurances can be given that the Tax Proposals will be enacted as proposed, or at all. This
summary does not otherwise take into account or anticipate any changes in law or
administrative practices or assessing policies, whether by legislative, regulatory, administrative
or judicial decision or action, nor does it take into account other federal, provincial, territorial or
foreign tax considerations which may differ from those discussed herein.

This summary is of a general nature only and is not, and is not intended to be, legal or tax
advice to any particular holder. This summary is not exhaustive of all federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to a particular holder. Accordingly, prospective purchasers
of notes should consult their own tax advisors with respect to their particular circumstances.

**Canadian Resident Holders**

The following portion of this summary is generally applicable only to a holder who, at all
relevant times, for purposes of the Tax Act, is or is deemed to be a resident of Canada, is not
affiliated with the Issuer, any Note Guarantor or the Initial Purchasers and holds the notes as
capital property (a “Canadian Resident Holder”). Generally, the notes will be capital property to
a holder provided the holder does not use or hold the notes in the course of carrying on a
business and has not acquired or held them as part of an adventure or concern in the nature of
trade. The notes will not be “Canadian securities” for the purpose of the irrevocable election
under subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act to treat all “Canadian securities,” as defined in the Tax
Act, owned by a holder as capital property, and therefore no such election will apply to the
notes. Holders who do not hold notes as capital property should consult their own tax advisors
regarding their particular circumstances.

The following portion of this summary is not applicable to a Canadian Resident Holder (i) an
interest in which is a “tax shelter investment”, as defined in the Tax Act, (ii) that is a “financial
institution”, as defined in the Tax Act for purposes of certain rules in the Tax Act, referred to as
the “mark-to-market” rules, (iii) that reports its “Canadian tax results”, as defined in the Tax Act,
in a currency other than Canadian currency or (iv) that has entered or will enter into a
“derivative forward agreement,” as such term is defined in the Tax Act, in respect of the notes.
Any such Canadian Resident Holder should consult its own tax advisors with respect to the tax
consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the notes.

103


-----

**Currency Conversion**

The notes are denominated in U.S. dollars. For purposes of the Tax Act, all amounts relating
to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the notes must be converted into Canadian dollars
based on exchange rates determined in accordance with the Tax Act. The amount of interest
required to be included in the income of, and capital gains or capital losses realized by, a
Canadian Resident Holder may be affected by currency fluctuations.

**Taxation of Interest and Other Amounts**

A Canadian Resident Holder that is a corporation, partnership, unit trust or trust of which a
corporation or partnership is a beneficiary will be required to include in computing its income
for a taxation year all interest on a note that accrues or is deemed to accrue to such Canadian
Resident Holder to the end of that taxation year, or that becomes receivable or is received by
such Canadian Resident Holder before the end of that taxation year (including amounts, if any,
withheld or deducted therefrom on account of U.S. withholding tax), to the extent that such
amount was not otherwise included in computing the Canadian Resident Holder’s income for a
preceding taxation year.

Any other Canadian Resident Holder, including an individual or a trust (other than a trust
described in the preceding paragraph), will be required to include in computing its income for a
taxation year any interest that is received or receivable in respect of a note by such Canadian
Resident Holder in that taxation year (depending upon the method regularly followed by the
Canadian Resident Holder in computing income) (including amounts, if any, withheld or
deducted therefrom on account of U.S. withholding tax), to the extent that such interest was not
otherwise included in computing the Canadian Resident Holder’s income for a preceding
taxation year.

Any amount paid by the Issuer to a Canadian Resident Holder as a penalty or bonus
because of the redemption or repurchase by it of a note before the maturity thereof will be
deemed to be interest received on the note by the Canadian Resident Holder at the time of
payment to the extent that such amount can reasonably be considered to relate to, and does not
exceed the value at the time of redemption or repurchase of, the interest that would have been
paid or payable by the Issuer on the note for a taxation year of the Issuer ending after the
redemption or repurchase. Such interest (including amounts, if any, withheld or deducted
therefrom on account of U.S. withholding tax) will be required to be included in computing the
Canadian Resident Holder’s income in the manner described above.

To the extent that U.S. withholding tax is payable by a Canadian Resident Holder in respect
of any interest received on the notes, the Canadian Resident Holder may be eligible for a foreign
tax credit or deduction under the Tax Act to the extent and under the circumstances described in
the Tax Act. Canadian Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
availability of a foreign tax credit or deduction, having regard to their particular circumstances.

**Dispositions**

On a disposition or a deemed disposition of a note, including a repurchase or redemption
by the Issuer prior to maturity, or a repayment by the Issuer upon maturity, a Canadian Resident
Holder generally will be required to include in computing its income for the taxation year in
which the disposition occurs all interest that has accrued or that is deemed to have accrued on
the note from the date of the last interest payment to the date of disposition, except to the
extent that such interest has otherwise been included in the Canadian Resident Holder’s income
for that taxation year or a preceding taxation year.

104


-----

In addition, the disposition or deemed disposition of a note generally will result in a capital
gain (or a capital loss) equal to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, which
do not include any amount included in the Canadian Resident Holder’s income as interest, and
net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base of
the note to the Canadian Resident Holder immediately before the disposition. Generally, a
Canadian Resident Holder is required to include in computing its income for a taxation year
one-half of the amount of any such capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”). Subject to and in
accordance with the provisions of the Tax Act, a Canadian Resident Holder is required to deduct
one-half of the amount of any such capital loss (an “allowable capital loss”) realized in a
taxation year from taxable capital gains realized by the Canadian Resident Holder in the year
and allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains may be carried back and deducted
in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any subsequent
taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in such years. A capital gain realized by
an individual or by most trusts may give rise to liability for alternative minimum tax.

U.S. tax, if any, levied on any gain realized on a disposition of notes may be eligible for a
foreign tax credit under the Tax Act to the extent and under the circumstances described in the
Tax Act. Canadian Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the
availability of a foreign tax credit, having regard to their particular circumstances.

**Additional Refundable Tax**

A Canadian Resident Holder that is throughout the year a “Canadian-controlled private
corporation” (as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay an additional refundable tax on
certain investment income, including interest and taxable capital gains earned or received in
respect of the notes.

**Foreign Property Information Reporting**

In general, a Canadian Resident Holder that is a “specified Canadian entity” (as defined in
the Tax Act) for a taxation year or a fiscal period and whose total “cost amount” (as defined in
the Tax Act) of “specified foreign property” (as defined in the Tax Act) at any time in the year or
fiscal period exceeds C$100,000 will be required to file an information return with the Canada
Revenue Agency for the taxation year or fiscal period disclosing certain prescribed information
in respect of such property. Subject to certain exceptions, a taxpayer resident in Canada, other
than a corporation or trust exempt from tax under Part I of the Tax Act, will be a “specified
Canadian entity,” as will certain partnerships. The notes will be “specified foreign property” to a
Canadian Resident Holder. Penalties may apply where a Canadian Resident Holder fails to file
the required information return in respect of such Canadian Resident Holder’s “specified foreign
property” on a timely basis in accordance with the Tax Act.

The reporting rules in the Tax Act relating to “specified foreign property” are complex and
this summary does not purport to address all circumstances in which reporting may be required
by a Canadian Resident Holder. Canadian Resident Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the reporting rules contained in the Tax Act.

**Non-Canadian Resident Holders**

The following portion of this summary is generally applicable to a holder who, at all
relevant times, for purposes of the Tax Act, (i) is not, and is not deemed to be, a resident of
Canada and (ii) does not use or hold and is not deemed to use or hold the notes in the course of
a business carried on or deemed to be carried on in Canada. In addition, special rules, which are

105


-----

not discussed in this summary, may apply to a Non-Canadian Resident Holder that is an insurer
that carries on an insurance business in Canada and elsewhere.

A Non-Canadian Resident Holder will not be subject to Canadian withholding tax in respect
of amounts paid or credited, or deemed to be paid or credited, to the Non-Canadian Resident
Holder by the Issuer or any Note Guarantor as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in
satisfaction of interest, premium, bonus or principal on the notes, including in respect of a
redemption, repurchase or payment on maturity.

No other tax on income or gains will be payable by a Non-Canadian Resident Holder on
interest, principal, bonus or premium on the notes or on the proceeds received by
Non-Canadian Resident Holder on the disposition of a note including a redemption, repurchase
or payment on maturity.

106


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and they may
not be offered or sold within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. In addition, the notes have not been and will not be qualified for sale to the
public by prospectus under the securities laws of the Province of Quebec or any other province
or territory of Canada, and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from the
prospectus requirements of the Securities Act (Quebec) and other applicable provincial
securities laws. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold only (A) to QIBs in compliance
with Rule 144A and (B) outside the U.S. to persons other than U.S. persons (“non-U.S.
purchasers”, which term shall include dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the U.S. acting
on a discretionary basis for non-U.S. beneficial owners (other than an estate or trust)) in reliance
upon Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”).

As used herein, the terms “U.S.” and “U.S. person” have the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

Each purchaser or transferee of notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as
follows:

1. It is purchasing the notes as a principal for its own account or an account with respect to
which it exercises sole investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a
QIB, and is aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) a non-U.S.
purchaser that is outside the U.S. (or a non-U.S. purchaser that is a dealer or other fiduciary as
referred to above).

2. It acknowledges that the notes have not been and will not be registered under the
Securities Act, or qualified for sale to the public by prospectus under the Securities Act (Quebec)
or the securities laws of any other province or territory of Canada (together, “Canadian
Securities Laws”) and may not be offered or sold except as set forth below.

3. It shall not resell or otherwise transfer any of such notes prior to (i) the first anniversary
of the last date of original issuance of the notes (or such shorter period of time as permitted by
Rule 144(d) under the Securities Act) and (ii) such later date, if any, as may be required by
applicable laws, except (A) to the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (B) inside the U.S. to a QIB in
a transaction complying with Rule 144A, (C) inside the U.S. to institutional “accredited
investors” (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act), that, prior to
such transfer, furnishes (or has furnished on its behalf by a U.S. broker-dealer) to the Trustee a
signed letter containing certain representations and agreements relating to the restrictions on
transfer of the notes (the form of which letter can be obtained from such trustee), (D) outside
the U.S. in compliance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act, (E) pursuant to the exemption
from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available), (F) in accordance
with another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (and based
upon an opinion of counsel if the Issuer so requests), or (G) pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act. Further, it shall not resell or otherwise transfer any of such
notes except pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirements of Canadian
Securities Laws, or in a transaction that otherwise complies with or is not subject to the
prospectus requirements of Canadian Securities Laws.

4. It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the notes notice of any
restrictions on transfer of such notes.

107


-----

5. It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of
beneficial interests in a Global Note (in each case other than pursuant to an effective
registration statement) the holder of notes or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note,
as the case may be, may be required to provide certifications and other documentation relating
to the manner of such transfer and submit such certifications and other documentation as
provided in the indenture.

6. It understands that all of the notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect
unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer and the holder thereof:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR
SOLD WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF, U.S.
PERSONS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW. BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER
(1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER” (AS DEFINED IN RULE
144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT), (B) IT IS NOT A U.S. PERSON AND IS ACQUIRING THIS
SECURITY IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 904 UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OR (C) IT IS AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR (AS DEFINED IN RULE 501(a)(1), (2),
(3), OR (7) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (AN “ACCREDITED INVESTOR”)), (2) AGREES THAT IT
WILL NOT PRIOR TO THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF THIS
SECURITY RESELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS SECURITY EXCEPT (A) TO THE ISSUER OR
ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) INSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (C) INSIDE THE
UNITED STATES TO AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR THAT, PRIOR TO SUCH TRANSFER,
FURNISHES (OR HAS FURNISHED ON ITS BEHALF BY A U.S. BROKER-DEALER) TO THE
TRUSTEE A SIGNED LETTER CONTAINING CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS
RELATING TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY (THE FORM OF WHICH
LETTER CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE TRUSTEE FOR THIS SECURITY), (D) OUTSIDE THE
UNITED STATES IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 904 UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT (IF AVAILABLE), (E) PURSUANT TO THE EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (IF AVAILABLE), (F) IN
ACCORDANCE WITH ANOTHER EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE SECURITIES ACT (AND BASED UPON AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IF THE ISSUER SO
REQUESTS), OR (G) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON TO WHOM THIS
SECURITY IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND. IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE
ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF THIS SECURITY, IF THE PROPOSED TRANSFEREE IS AN ACCREDITED
INVESTOR, THE HOLDER MUST, PRIOR TO SUCH TRANSFER, FURNISH TO THE TRUSTEE AND
THE ISSUER SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL OPINIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS EITHER
OF THEM MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS BEING MADE
PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS
“OFFSHORE TRANSACTION”, “UNITED STATES” AND “U.S. PERSON” HAVE THE MEANING
GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

7. Either (a) no portion of the assets used by it to acquire and hold the notes, or any interest
therein, constitutes assets of any (i) employee benefit plan subject to Title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), (ii) plan or account subject to
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), (iii) entity deemed
to hold “plan assets” of any such employee benefit plan, plan or account (any plan, account or
arrangement described in (i), (ii) or (iii), a “Plan”) or (iv) governmental, church or non-U.S. plan

108


-----

that is not subject to Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to
other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to those provisions (“Similar Laws”) or
(b) the purchase, holding and subsequent disposition of the notes will not constitute or result in
a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or
violate any Similar Law.

8. If it is a Plan, a fiduciary acting on its behalf is causing it to purchase the notes and such
fiduciary:

a) Is a bank, an insurance carrier, a registered investment adviser, a registered brokerdealer or an independent fiduciary with at least $50 million of assets under management or
control as specified in 29 CFR Section 2510.3-21(c)(1)(i) (excluding an individual retirement
account (“IRA”) owner if the purchaser is an IRA);

b) Is independent (for purposes of 29 CFR Section 2510.3-21(c)(1)) of the Issuer, the
Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”);

c) Is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with
regard to particular transactions and investment strategies, including the purchaser’s
transactions with the Transaction Parties hereunder;

d) Has been advised that none of the Transaction Parties has undertaken or will
undertake to provide impartial investment advice, or has given or will give advice in a
fiduciary capacity, in connection with the purchaser’s transactions with the Transaction
Parties contemplated hereby;

e) Is a “fiduciary” under Section 3(21)(A) of ERISA or Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, or
both, as applicable, with respect to, and is responsible for exercising independent judgment
in evaluating, the purchaser’s transactions with the Transaction Parties contemplated
hereby; and

f) Understands and acknowledges the existence and nature of the underwriting
discounts, commissions and fees, and any other related fees, compensation arrangements
or financial interests, described in this offering memorandum; and understands,
acknowledges and agrees that no such fee or other compensation is a fee or other
compensation for the provision of investment advice, and that none of the Transaction
Parties, nor any of their respective directors, officers, members, partners, employees,
principals or agents has received or will receive a fee or other compensation from the
purchaser or such fiduciary for the provision of investment advice (rather than other
services) in connection with the purchaser’s transactions with the Transaction Parties
contemplated hereby.

The Issuer is not, and has no intention of becoming, a “reporting issuer,” as such term is
defined under Canadian securities laws, in any province or territory of Canada. Under no
circumstances will the Issuer be required to file a prospectus or similar document with any
securities regulator in Canada qualifying the resale of the notes to the public. Accordingly, the
resale provisions of section 2.5 of National Instrument 45-102—Resale of Securities will not be
available to holders of the notes.

The Initial Purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the notes being offered, if any
are taken. The offering price for the notes is set forth on the cover page of this offering
memorandum. After the notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the
offering price and other selling terms with respect to the notes. The offering of the notes by the
Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right
to reject any order in whole or in part.

The Initial Purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the
purchase agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the notes pursuant to this
offering memorandum.

The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the notes (A) to persons
they reasonably believe to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and
(B) outside the U.S. to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act.

In connection with sales outside the U.S., the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will
not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of
the Initial Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers
will send to each dealer to whom they sell such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation
or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the U.S. or to,
or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after
the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an
offer or sale of such notes within the U.S. by a dealer that is not participating in the offering
may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

One or more of the Initial Purchasers may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed
entities for sales of the notes in jurisdictions in which such Initial Purchasers are not otherwise
permitted to make such sales.

-----

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer has
been advised by the Initial Purchasers that certain of the Initial Purchasers intend to make a
market in the notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any
time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the
notes.

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the
open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases
to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of
a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing
transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or
retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress.

These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial
Purchasers for their own respective accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the
market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that
otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be
discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the
over-the-counter market or otherwise.

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to European Economic Area Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the
“Prospectus Directive”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA
may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Directive
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This Offering Memorandum is
not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

In addition, in the United Kingdom, this document is being distributed only to, and is

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Japan**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and
Exchange Law of Japan (the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law) and each Initial
Purchaser has agreed that it will not offer or sell any notes, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to,
or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan (which term as used herein means any person
resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan),
or to others for re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to a resident of Japan,
except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of, and otherwise in

112


-----

compliance with, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and any other applicable laws,
regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.

We have agreed with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., for 30 days after the date hereof, not to
offer, sell contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to
the notes without Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.’s prior written consent, other than the
Additional Notes.

We have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions
engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment
banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal
investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates has a lending relationship with
us, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hedge, and certain of
those Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are likely to hedge, their credit exposure to
us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers
and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which
consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about, 2018,
which will be the tenth business day following the date of this offering memorandum. Under
Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two
business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required,
by virtue of the fact that the notes will not initially settle in T+2, to specify an alternate
settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers
of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult
their advisors.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and
equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank
loans) for their own account and for the accounts of its customers. Such investment and
securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer and Valeant. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and
may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and
may in the future perform, various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial
banking services for the Issuer, and its affiliates, for which they received or will receive
customary fees and expenses. Affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers are lenders and/or
agents under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their
respective affiliates may hold the Tender Offer Notes, and such Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates may therefore receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. In
connection with acting as an underwriter and/or an initial purchaser in various prior transactions
for us, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are named as defendants in
litigation relating to those prior transactions and may seek indemnification from us under the
applicable purchase agreement for any liability and expenses arising from such litigation.

**ANNEX A**
**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES**

The following is an overview of certain insolvency considerations and limitations on the
validity and enforceability of the guarantees in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States
and Canada.

**France**

Bausch & Lomb France S.A.S., BCF S.A.S. and Laboratoire Chauvin S.A.S., Guarantors of
the Notes (the “French Guarantors”), are incorporated under the laws of France and, as such,
any insolvency proceedings applicable to the French Guarantors may be governed by French
insolvency law.

French courts may also have jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings with respect
to other companies of the group if the conditions provided for under the Regulation (EU)
2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) (if applicable) are met, or, if not applicable, in
accordance with traditional French private international law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in France.

**Grace Periods**

Pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil
proceeding involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into
account the debtor’s financial position and the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise
reschedule the payment dates or payment obligations over a maximum period of two years. In
addition, pursuant to Article 1343-5, if a debtor specifically initiates proceedings thereunder,
French courts may decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or
rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate which is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower
than the legal rate) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal.
If a court order under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code is made, it will suspend any
pending enforcement measures, and any contractual interest or penalty for late payment will
not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the court.

When the debtor is subject to conciliation proceeding, these provisions shall be read in
combination with Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, see “—Conciliation
Proceedings (Procédure de Conciliation).”

**Insolvency—Cessation des Paiements**

Under French law, a company is deemed insolvent (in cessation des paiements) when it is
not able to pay its debts as they fall due out of its available and liquid assets, taking into account
any moratorium which its creditors may have granted as well as any available liquidity reserves.

The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings (either judicial reorganization
or judicial liquidation) within 45 days of becoming insolvent unless it has initiated conciliation
proceedings within the same period. If it does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto
managers, may be subject to civil liability. Insolvency proceedings may also be initiated upon
the initiative of a creditor or of the State prosecutor, provided that the debtor is insolvent.

A-1


-----

**Court-Assisted Proceedings**

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are informal amicable proceedings carried out_
under the supervision of the President of the commercial court. A trustee (as the case may be, a
mandataire ad hoc or a conciliateur) is appointed confidentially by the President of the
commercial court in order to help the debtor reach an agreement with its creditors in particular
by reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. The debtor may propose, in the filing for the
commencement of the proceedings, the appointment of a particular person as trustee.

**Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings (Mandat Ad Hoc)**

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings are confidential proceedings available to solvent debtors. The_
process is voluntary, the legal representative of the company being the only one entitled to file a
request with the President of the commercial court for the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc.
A restructuring agreement may be negotiated between the company and its main creditors on a
consensual basis—those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement.
In the event an agreement is reached, the President of the commercial court may acknowledge
(constater) it but the acknowledged agreement will have no binding effect upon third parties
and will not benefit from any statutory protections. There is no time limit for the duration of
_mandat ad hoc proceedings._

**Conciliation Proceedings (Procédure de Conciliation)**

A company may, in its sole discretion, request the commencement of conciliation
proceedings (procédure de conciliation) with respect to itself, provided it (i) is not insolvent or
has not been insolvent for more than 45 days, and (ii) experiences legal, economic or financial
difficulties. The competent commercial court will appoint a conciliator (conciliateur) to help the
company reach an agreement with its creditors for reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness.
Such agreement may be either confidentially acknowledged (constaté) by the President of the
commercial court (in which case the agreement becomes immediately enforceable (exécutoire))
or approved (homologué) by the commercial court. The main consequences of the approval
(homologation) by the commercial court will be the following:

   - creditors who provide new money or goods or services designed to ensure the
continuation of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders
providing new equity) will enjoy a preferential treatment in the event of subsequent
insolvency proceedings; and

   - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of the cessation des paiements, which is the starting date of the
“hardening period” preceding the opening of insolvency proceedings (see below),
cannot be fixed by the commercial court as of a date earlier than the date of the
approval of the agreement.

Conciliation proceedings are also confidential, but, in case of approval by the commercial
court, third parties are informed that such an agreement has been entered into, through a
publication. Conciliation proceedings may last up to five months.

If a creditor seeks payment during conciliation proceedings, then pursuant to Article L.
611-7 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having opened the conciliation proceedings
has jurisdiction to grant a grace period to the debtor, in accordance with article 1343-5 et seq. of
the French Civil Code, provided that the debtor has received a formal notice requesting payment
or faces enforcement measures, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard

A-2


-----

the conciliator. This judge also has jurisdiction to grant such a grace period during the
implementation of the conciliation agreement (i.e., after the end of the conciliation
proceedings), in relation to claims of non-consenting creditors (other than public creditors),
provided that this agreement has been either recognized or sanctioned by a court decision, as
discussed below.

Conciliation proceedings may also be the first step of:

   - Either a so-called “prepack” sale of business to be implemented in subsequent judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. Potential purchasers of the business
are sought during the conciliation proceedings, and the sale of the company’s business
is then implemented very quickly after the opening of insolvency proceedings; or

   - Accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, see “—Safeguard
Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde)” and “—Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings
(Procédure de Sauvegarde Accélérée).”

**Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde)**

The safeguard proceedings allows for the establishment of a restructuring plan under
commercial court supervision before the company becomes insolvent. It is available only at the
request of a debtor company. The objectives of safeguard proceedings are, in order of priority,
to safeguard the debtor’s activity, to safeguard jobs and to pay creditors. French insolvency
proceedings are safeguard proceedings (including accelerated safeguard and accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings), judicial reorganization proceedings and judicial liquidation.
The debtor must be solvent (i.e., not unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets) but
experiencing difficulties that cannot be overcome. Safeguard proceedings are public and
include an automatic stay of all actions against the debtor for up to six months, renewable for
an additional six months with commercial court approval and which can be extended to a
maximum of 18 months upon request of the state prosecutor. During this period (the
“observation period”), the debtor and the insolvency officers try to elaborate a viable
restructuring plan (including a debt restructuring) called the “safeguard plan,” and to have it
adopted by the court.

During the observation period, payments by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the
commencement of the proceedings are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The
supervising judge (juge-commissaire) can authorize payments for prepetition debts in order to
discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the business or get back
goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Debts
arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings will be given priority over debts
incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings if they relate to expenses
necessary for the business’s ordinary activities or are for the requirements of the proceedings.

One of the main features of the safeguard proceedings consists in the creation of two
creditors’ committees (mandatory for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a
turnover exceeding €20 million, optional below such thresholds), one consisting of credit
institutions and “assimilated entities” (including not only credit institutions but also any entity
having granted credit facilities to the debtor, and any assignees of such receivables) and the
other of the main trade creditors (creditors whose claim is equal to more than 3% of the
company’s total debt to its trade creditors), and a general meeting of noteholders (comprising
all holders of all notes issued by the Company even they relate to different issues and no matter
what the applicable law of those notes is) in the event the relevant debtor has issued bonds, to
which the debtor submits a draft safeguard plan. Any member of the creditors’ committees (but
not of the general meeting of noteholders) is also entitled to submit a draft safeguard plan.

A-3


-----

The plan is approved where members of each committee voting in favor of the plan account
for at least two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote. In cases
where bonds have been issued by the relevant French company, the plan, if approved by the
committees, is then submitted to the general meeting of noteholders (majority of two thirds of
the outstanding claims of the noteholders expressing a vote). Each member of a committee or
of the general meeting of noteholders must inform the court-appointed administrator of any
agreement subjecting its vote to certain conditions or providing for the total or partial payment
of its claim by a third-party or any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator
can then modulate the voting rights of such a creditor, and submit to such creditor the
conditions of calculation of its voting rights. In case of disagreement on this calculation, the
creditor or the court-appointed administrator may seize the president of the court in summary
proceedings. Those creditors or bondholders whose repayment terms are not affected by the
draft plan or for which the draft plan provides for a full repayment in cash upon approval of the
plan will not take part in the vote. The committees and the general meeting of noteholders, if
any, shall vote on the plan within six months of the date of the judgment commencing the
proceedings (subject to a potential court decision to postpone this deadline).

Creditors which are not members of committees and which are not noteholders are
consulted on an individual basis on debt rescheduling, write-offs and/or debt-for-equity swaps.
Creditors are deemed to have accepted the debt rescheduling or write-offs proposals if they fail
to respond within 30 days from the receipt of the debtor’s proposal. However, in respect to
debt-for-equity swap proposals, the creditors’ representative must obtain the agreement of each
creditor in writing.

The plan submitted to the committees and the noteholders, if any, may include not only
rescheduling of debts but also cancellation of debts and debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity
swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). The plan may provide for a different
treatment of creditors if their differences of situation so justify. The plan must “take into
account” intercreditor subordination agreements entered into prior to the opening of the
proceedings (which does not mean that the plan must necessarily be totally compliant with such
agreements). Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of
noteholders, if any, and subject to verification by the commercial court that creditors’ interests
are adequately preserved, the commercial court can approve the plan, in which case the plan
will be binding also on dissenting members of the committees and on noteholders (if any). For
those individual creditors which have not accepted the debtor’s proposals, the commercial court
can reschedule repayment of their claims over a maximum period of 10 years, except for debts
with maturity dates of more than 10 years, in which case the maturity date may remain the
same. The commercial court cannot oblige such creditors to waive part of their claim. The first
payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and
subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the total
admitted pre-filing liabilities).

The commercial court can also adopt a safeguard plan in the absence of creditors’
committees (e.g., because such committees were not created or because they were dissolved
following their failure to vote within the specified period or following their decision to reject the
draft plan). In such a case, all creditors are consulted on an individual basis, as explained above
(in particular, with respect to creditors rejecting the debtor’s proposals, the commercial court
can only impose a rescheduling of the repayment of the debts over a maximum period of 10
years, except for debts with maturity dates of more than 10 years, in which case the maturity
date may remain the same).

A-4

**Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde Accélérée)**

A company in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of
accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) if (i) while not being en
_cessation des paiements (i.e., being unable to pay its debts as they fall due out of its available_
assets) for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation, it is facing
difficulties that it cannot overcome, (ii) it (x) has its accounts certified by a statutory auditor
(commissaire aux comptes) or established by certified public accountant (expert comptable) and
has (A) more than 20 employees or (B) a turnover greater than € 3 million excluding any
applicable taxes or (C) total assets in its balance sheet greater than € 1.5 million or
(y) establishes consolidated financial statements in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the
French Commercial Code and (iii) it has prepared, in the context of conciliation proceedings, a
draft safeguard plan that aims to protect its operations in the long run and which is likely to be
supported by a sufficiently large majority of the creditors to allow the adoption of the plan by
the creditors’ committees and the noteholders’ general meeting within the duration of the
procedure (i.e., three months from the opening judgment of the accelerated safeguard
procedure).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast track” the safeguard
proceedings for large companies. The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings
is roughly similar to the regular safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible with the
accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard proceedings. Therefore, some provisions relating in
particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims made by owners benefiting from retention
of title clauses are, for instance, excluded by law.

Trade creditors are involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings. Where accelerated
safeguard proceedings are opened, the credit institutions committee, the trade creditors’
committee and the general meeting of noteholders are convened and are required to vote on
the proposed accelerated safeguard plan within the minimum period of 15 days from delivery of
the proposed plan (as applicable in safeguard proceedings).

As with traditional safeguard proceedings, the plan adopted in the context of accelerated
safeguard proceedings may notably provide for rescheduling of debts, debt cancellation or
debt-for-equity swaps (requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

The maximum duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months. If, during
this period, no plan is adopted by the required majorities of the creditors’ committee and the
general meeting of noteholders, the commercial court shall terminate the accelerated safeguard
proceedings.

**Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde Financière Accélérée)**

A company in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).
The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is similar to that
applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings but it is designed to “fast-track” safeguard
proceedings dealing with purely financial difficulties. The key difference between accelerated
safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is that the latter relate
only to debts owed to so-called “financial debts” (i.e., debts towards entities that are eligible
members of the credit institutions’ committee and debts towards noteholders which are eligible
members of the general meeting of noteholders described above), which are subjected to an
automatic stay and dealt with under the safeguard plan. Other classes of creditors, such as

A-5


-----

suppliers or public creditors, are not affected by the proceedings. The company therefore
continues to trade normally while the proceedings are pending, thus reducing significantly the
impact of such safeguard proceedings on operational companies.

The same conditions mentioned above for the opening of accelerated safeguard
proceedings also apply to a debtor eligible for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings,
provided that the accounts of the debtor offer evidence that a plan prepared in the context of
conciliation proceedings is supported by a large majority of those financial creditors who will be
affected by the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as indicated in the preceding
paragraph), and is likely to be adopted within the duration of the procedure.

The content of the safeguard plan and conditions of its adoption are the same as in
accelerated safeguard proceedings, except that the credit institutions’ committee and the
general meeting of noteholders are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a
shortened minimum period of eight days of being notified of the proposed plan.

The duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings must not exceed one
month, unless the commercial court decides to extend it by one additional month. If, during this
period, no plan is adopted by the required majorities of the financial creditors and noteholders
(the same majority rules apply as in committees in regular safeguard proceedings), the
commercial court shall terminate the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings and may not
impose any uniform debt rescheduling on creditors.

**Judicial Reorganization (Procédure de Redressement Judiciaire)**

A judicial reorganization may be initiated with respect to a company incorporated in France
(or a foreign company whose center of main interest is situated in France) if it cannot pay its
due debts out of its available assets (i.e., if it is in cessation des paiements) provided that its
financial situation is capable of improving.

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor, the commercial court or the
State prosecutor. The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of
becoming in cessation des paiements unless it has initiated a conciliation proceeding within the
same period. If it does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto managers, may be
subject to civil liability.

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the same as those of safeguard
proceedings. Most of the rules applicable to safeguard proceedings apply to judicial
reorganization proceedings. In particular, the commencement of judicial reorganization
proceedings triggers an automatic stay of proceedings against the debtor during the
observation period (subject to the same limited exceptions). As with safeguard proceedings, the
restructuring plan (the “reorganization plan”) may be adopted by two creditors’ committees
(mandatory for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding
€ 20 million, optional below such thresholds), one consisting of credit institutions and
“assimilated entities” and the other of the main trade creditors (creditors whose claim is equal
to more than 3% of the company’s total debt to its trade creditors), and a general meeting of
noteholders (comprising all holders of all notes issued by the company even they relate to
different issues and no matter what the applicable law of those notes is).

The reorganization plan can combine all of the following: a debt restructuring, a
recapitalization of the company, a debt-for-equity swap (always with the relevant shareholder
approval) and the sale of certain assets or of portions of the business.

A-6


-----

In addition, Law No. 2015-990 dated August 6, 2015 (known as “loi Macron”) has introduced
a new provision (Article L. 631-19-2 of the French Commercial Code) applicable to judicial
reorganization proceedings opened as from August 7, 2015 in the cases where (i) a debtor
(a) employs more than 150 employees or (b) controls one or more companies employing 150
employees, (ii) the disappearance of such debtor is likely to cause serious disturbance to the
national or local economy and to local employment, and (iii) a share capital modification
appears, after review of total or partial disposal plan solutions, the only credible solution to
avoid such a disturbance and to allow the debtor’s business activities to continue. In summary,
if, in such event, a reorganization plan provides for a modification of the share capital in favor of
one or more person(s) who undertake to execute the plan (e.g., the new majority shareholders)
and the existing shareholders refuse to vote in favor of such share capital modification, the
commercial court may, under certain procedural and substantial conditions (e.g., the payment
to the evicted shareholders of an amount corresponding to the value of their shares, as
determined by a commercial court-appointed expert if no agreement as to such value is reached
among the parties) and upon request of the commercial court-appointed administrator or the
State prosecutor, either (a) appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to vote in favor of a share
capital increase in place of the dissenting shareholders or (b) order, in favor of the person(s)
who have undertaken to execute the plan, the transfer of all or part of the shares owned by the
dissenting shareholders who own a majority of voting rights or hold a blocking minority in the
company. Any approval clause included in the company’s constitutional documents is deemed
null and void.

If no reorganization plan is drafted or if the draft reorganization plan appears obviously
incapable of restoring the debtor’s viability, the court may decide to adopt a sale plan (plan de
_cession), i.e., a plan whereby all or part of the business is sold to a third party which can cherry-_
pick the assets, contracts and employees, without (subject to certain exceptions) the need to
obtain the consent of either the debtor, the creditors or the other party to certain contracts (such
as lease-back agreements or supply agreements of goods and services). Any third party may
make a bid to that effect as from the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings. If such a
sale plan is adopted, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated for the repayment of the creditors
according to the ranking of their claims. The sale price is generally significantly lower than the
aggregate value of the assets, bearing in mind that the courts would endorse the most credible
offer that would best ensure the preservation of jobs.

**Judicial Liquidation (Procédure de Liquidation Judiciaire)**

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor or the State prosecutor if the
debtor is cannot pay its due debts out of its available assets (i.e., if it is in “cessation des
_paiement”) and its recovery is not possible. The aim of these proceedings is to liquidate a_
company and end its activities, by selling its business, either as a whole or per branch of activity
or asset by asset. The activity is ended from the opening of proceedings, except if a sale of all or
part of the business is feasible. In such a case, the court authorizes the company to continue its
activity during a maximum period of three months (renewable once) to implement such a sale.

Liquidation proceedings trigger an automatic stay of proceedings against the company.
However, secured creditors benefiting from a pledge are, where the applicable security
arrangements so contemplate, entitled to enforce their security interest through a courtmonitored allocation process (attribution judiciaire) (i.e., request the court to transfer ownership
of the pledged asset(s)). In any case, secured creditors benefiting from a pledge or a mortgage
are entitled to enforce their security interest if the liquidator has not commenced selling the
asset subject to the pledge or mortgage within three months from the judgment opening the
liquidation proceedings.

A-7


-----

The commercial court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the
liquidator having sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation
of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance
_d’actif)._

**Void and Voidable Transactions**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the
court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings.
However, in the decision commencing judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings
or in a subsequent decision, a court may set the date on which the debtor became insolvent at
an earlier date, up to 18 months prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings. This
date is important because it marks the beginning of the “hardening period,” which lasts until
the opening of the insolvency proceedings. Certain transactions entered into by the debtor
during the suspect period are, by law, automatically void or voidable by the court.

Automatically void transactions include in particular transactions or payments entered into
during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some
creditors to the detriment of other creditors. Such transactions or payments must be set aside
by the court if a claimant (the judicial administrator, the liquidator, the creditors’ representative
or the court-appointed trustee in charge of overseeing the implementation of the restructuring
plan, or the State prosecutor) so requests. These include, notably, transfers of assets for no
consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly
exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments
made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, security
granted for debts previously incurred, provisional measures (unless the right of attachment or
seizure predates the date of insolvency), share options granted or sold during the suspect
period, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer
is made as a security for debt incurred at the same time), and any amendment to a trust
arrangement (fiducie) that dedicates assets or rights as a guaranty of pre-existing debts.

Voidable transactions include, (i) transactions for consideration, (ii) payments of due and
payable debts or (iii) notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur),
seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case, if such actions are taken after the
debtor was in cessation des paiements and the party dealing with the debtor knew that the
debtor was in cessation des paiements at that time. In addition, transactions relating to transfers
of assets for no consideration are also voidable when carried out during the six-month period
prior to the beginning of the suspect period. Unlike void transactions, which must be set aside
by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to
set aside transactions that are only “voidable.”

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings, since the
condition required to commence such proceedings is that the company is not insolvent (en état
_de cessation des paiements) within the meaning of French law._

Article L. 650-1 of the French commercial code also provides that when safeguard,
accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial
liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings are initiated, creditors cannot be held liable for
damages resulting from facilities that they granted, unless they acted fraudulently or
deliberately interfered with the management of the debtor or if security interests granted to
secure such facilities (which may include bonds) were out of proportion with the latter. Case law
has recently set out that this liability would also require that the granting of the facility be

A-8


-----

deemed to be wrongful. If the creditors are held liable, the security interests granted to secure
the facility may be held void or reduced by a commercial court. The date at which the
proportion should be analyzed is the date when the security interests were granted, not the date
when they were enforced. With regard to the extent by which the security interests must exceed
the amount of the facility to be considered “out of proportion” this is a question which is
reviewed by French courts on a case-by-case basis.

**Status of Creditors**

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the
commencement of the proceedings must file a proof of claim with the creditors’ representative
within two months of the publication of the commercial court commencing the proceedings in
the Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales; this period is extended to four
months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors who have not submitted their claims
during the relevant period are, except with respect to very limited exceptions, barred from
receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings and their unasserted claims are
unenforceable (inopposables) during the safeguard or reorganization plan and even after the
plan if the obligations under the plan have been complied with. Employees are not subject to
such limits and are preferential creditors under French law.

Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company’s obligations
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings or the occurrence of a state of cessation des
_paiements are not enforceable under French law. The commencement of liquidation_
proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of the company’s obligations. If,
however, the court authorizes the company to continue its activity because a sale of all of the
business is feasible, the company’s obligations which have not yet matured shall only mature as
at the date of the judgment ordering such total sale of the business. The administrator may opt
for the continuation (or not) of on-going contracts (contrats en cours) (except for employment
contracts). The continuation of on-going contracts requires that the company fully performs its
contractual obligations arising after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings. French
insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including
employees, the commercial court, officials appointed by the commercial court as required by
the insolvency proceedings, certain post-petition creditors, certain secured creditors and the
French tax authorities.

As from the commencement of insolvency proceedings:

   - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans providing for an initial term
of at least one year, or contracts providing for a payment which is differed by at least
one year; even in such a case, accrued interest cannot bear themselves interest,
notwithstanding Article 1343-2 of the French Civil Code (as it currently stands));

   - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the date of the court
decision commencing the insolvency proceedings, subject to specified exceptions which
essentially cover the set-off of related debts (compensation pour dettes connexes),
payments authorized by the supervising judge (juge- commissaire) to recover assets for
which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business; and

   - creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor with
respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the insolvency
proceedings if the objective of such legal action is:

   - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor
(however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due);

A-9


-----

   - to terminate or cancel a contract for non-payment of pre-opening amounts owed to the
creditor; or

   - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor (subject to limited
exceptions).

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors,
including in particular employees, the commercial court, officials appointed by the commercial
court as required by the insolvency proceedings, certain creditors whose claims arose after the
commencement of the insolvency proceedings, secured creditors and the French tax authorities.
Some creditors may nevertheless bypass this order of priority, e.g., if they benefit from a
retention right over certain assets.

**Corporate Benefit Rules—Limitation on Enforcement of the Guarantee**

The grant of a guarantee by a French Guarantor for the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes must be for the corporate benefit of such French Guarantor. Under Articles L.242-6 and
L.244-1 of the French Commercial Code, directors and managers of a company incorporated as
a société par actions simplifiée (simplified joint- stock company) such as the French Guarantors,
may be prosecuted for misappropriation of corporate funds and/ or credit if they are determined
to have, in bad faith, used the company’s property or credit in a manner which they knew to be
contrary to the company’s interests for personal ends or for the benefit of another company in
which they have a direct or indirect interest.

Furthermore, under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee
unenforceable and void, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee,
require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that
the French Guarantor did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the
transaction involving the grant of the guarantee as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a
factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts
guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French
case law provides no clear guidance.

However, based on current case law certain inter-group transactions (including up-stream
guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the relevant company, in particular, where the
following four criteria are fulfilled:

   - existence of a genuine group of companies to which the guarantor and the person
whose obligations are being guaranteed belong operating under a common strategy
aimed at a common objective and the guarantee, and the transaction to which they
relate, must be entered into in furtherance of the common economic interest of the
group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate with
such group benefit;

   - the risk assumed by a French Guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;

   - the French Guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or
advantage from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee which is
commensurate with the liability which it takes on under the guarantee; and

   - the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its
financial capability.

A-10


-----

However, such criteria being subject to interpretation and depending on factual matters, the
prudent approach prevailing in the French market is to create a strict correlation between the
risk assumed and the benefit received by a French Guarantor without relying on the corporate
benefit of the group (intérêt social de groupe) and applying the conditions listed above and
therefore, limiting the amounts of the guarantee to the amounts on-lent to the French
Guarantors as set out below.

Each Guarantee provided by a French Guarantor will apply only insofar as required to:

(i) guarantee the payment obligations under the Indenture and the notes of its direct or
indirect subsidiaries which are or become Issuer or Note Guarantor from time to time under the
Indenture and the notes and incurred by those subsidiaries as Issuer and Note Guarantors
(without double counting). However, where such subsidiary is itself a Note Guarantor which
guarantees the obligations of a member of the Group which is not a subsidiary of the relevant
French Guarantor, the amounts payable by such French Guarantor under this paragraph (i) in
respect of the obligations of this subsidiary as Note Guarantor shall be limited as set out in
paragraph (ii) below; and

(ii) guarantee the payment obligations under the Indenture and the notes of each other
Issuer or Note Guarantor which is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of that French Guarantor,
provided that in each case such guarantee shall be limited to the payment obligations of such
other Issuer or Note Guarantor under the Indenture and the notes provided that these shall not
exceed an amount equal to the aggregate of all amounts made available (directly or indirectly)
to such other Issuer or Note Guarantor under the Indenture and the notes and on-lent (directly
or indirectly by way of intra-group loans) to such French Guarantor and outstanding from time
to time (such amount being the “French Maximum Guaranteed Amount”).

It being specified that any payment made by such French Guarantor in accordance with
paragraph (ii) above in respect of the obligations of any other Issuer or Note Guarantor shall
reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans (if any) due by such French
Guarantor to that Issuer or Note Guarantor under the intercompany loan arrangements referred
to above. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by a French Guarantor in respect of
the payment obligations of an Issuer or a Note Guarantor referred to in paragraph (ii) above
shall reduce the French Maximum Guaranteed Amount.

No French Guarantor will secure liabilities under the Indenture and the notes which would
result in such French Guarantor not complying with French financial assistance rules as set out
in Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and/or would
constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of Article L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the
French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) or any other law or regulations having the same
effect, as interpreted by French courts.

No French Guarantor will be acting jointly and severally with the Issuer and/or the other
Note Guarantors and no French Guarantor shall be deemed to be a “co-débiteur solidaire” as to
its obligations arising under or in connection with any such guarantee given in accordance with
the Indenture and the notes. By virtue of this limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations
under the Note Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
notes or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the Note Guarantee
should the balance of the portion of the proceeds of the notes made available to a French
Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to or reduced to zero.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic
return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a

A-11


-----

transaction entered into on an arms’ length basis, the difference between the actual economic
benefit and that in a comparable arms’ length transaction could be taxable under certain
circumstances.

The rights of the holders of the notes under the Note Guarantee are also subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Note Guarantee is also contractually adjusted so that such guarantee (together with the
guarantee granted under the Credit Facilities) does not result in interest payments not being
deductible for corporate income tax purposes when compared to the position that would have
been applicable in the absence of such guarantee and indemnity obligations. By virtue of this
limitation, a Note Guarantor’s obligations under the Note Guarantee may be less than the
amount that a noteholder could have claimed in the absence of such limitation.

**Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French
Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an
agreement such as the Intercreditor Agreement, except for Article L.626-30-2 of the French
Commercial Code which states that, in the context of safeguard proceedings (applicable in
judicial reorganization proceedings), the safeguard plan which is put to the vote of the creditors’
committees takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination
agreements between creditors which were entered into prior to the commencement of the
safeguard proceedings. As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as at
the date of this offering memorandum, has received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule
out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

**Fraudulent Conveyance**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside of insolvency proceedings, called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne
offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed
by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements
benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged
in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by, as the case may be, the
creditors’ representative or the trustee in charge of overseeing the implementation of the
restructuring plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) of the relevant debtor, or any creditor
who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside
insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the
person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the
case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of
recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person
and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such
person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the
act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such knowledge of the
counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If
a court found that the issuance of the notes, the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the
notes, the granting of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or

A-12


-----

declared unenforceable against the creditor that lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act.
As a result of such successful challenges, the noteholders may not enjoy the benefit of the
notes, the guarantees and the value of any consideration that the noteholders received with
respect to the notes, the guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the noteholders and,
possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, the noteholders
might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Note
Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**Germany**

**Insolvency**

Several of the Note Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany and have their
registered office in Germany. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main
interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No 1346/2000 on
Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. Consequently,
any insolvency proceedings with regard to such Note Guarantors (together, the “German
Guarantors”), is likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the German Guarantors were held to
have its centre of main interest within the territory of Germany at the time the application for
the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency
law would most likely govern such proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in
particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as
favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in
respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the
duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of the recovery of
payments due on the notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the jurisdiction of the
German courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a
Member State other than Germany. This issue is to be determined at the time when the
competent court decides on the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally
means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies,
there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent
there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency
proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the
group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in
the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. A
draft act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur
_Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) is currently under discussion in_
Germany. However, according to this draft act it is mainly intended to provide for coordination
of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The draft act does not
provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or
a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims
amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the
German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies:
(i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the
appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is
facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency
administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination

A-13


-----

proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency
administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan”
(Koordinationsplan). It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified
form, this bill might be adopted by the German parliament.

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent
insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor
or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or if the debtor
is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the
relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is overindebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values),
unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely
(positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to
pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it
is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst)
and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by
such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation
based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable_
shareholder becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and,
under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency
proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three weeks after the mandatory
insolvency reason (i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness) occurred. Non-compliance with
these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions
under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid
insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its
payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in
time within a certain prognosis period. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is
entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of an
imminent illiquidity of the debtor.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which
monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the
insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the
property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag). The
insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims
against the debtor’s moveable assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the
court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status_
(Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency proceeding in which the debtor’s management generally
remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a
custodian (Sachwalter). The order for opening an insolvency proceeding as
debtor-in-possession proceeding requires that (i) it has been requested by the debtor and (ii) no
circumstances are known which lead to the expectation that the order will place the creditors at
a disadvantage. If the debtor’s request for debtor-in-possession proceeding does not manifestly
lack the prospect of success, the court shall in the opening proceedings refrain from (i) imposing
on the debtor a general prohibition on making dispositions or (ii) ordering that all of the
debtor’s dispositions are effective only with the consent of a preliminary insolvency
administrator. In this case, instead of a preliminary insolvency administrator, a preliminary
custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) shall be appointed who shall supervise the management of
the debtor in the preliminary insolvency proceeding (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung).

A-14


-----

If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an
insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness),
combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and
can prove (by way of a certification provided by a tax advisor, accountant or lawyer with
experience in insolvency matters) that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile
(offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court shall, upon the request of the debtor, set a deadline of up
to three months for submission of an insolvency plan (Schutzschirm). During this period, the
creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended.
Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a preliminary custodian
(vorläufiger Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual
to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless
the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not
competent or impartial).

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and several other circumstances,
the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary creditors’ committee will be asked for their view on a_
petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency
administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court.
In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an
individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not
eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’
committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative
of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as
one for the employees.

The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to
preserve the debtor’s assets (which, depending on the circumstances, includes the continuation
of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to
assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des
_Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets_
(Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the
debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency
proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of
such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for
insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) (usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary
insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession
status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In case the court orders for a debtor-in-possession status,
the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business
affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose
of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors
(Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to request the change of the individual appointed as
insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by_
head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual
becoming the new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual be eligible as
officeholder (i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency

A-15


-----

administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the
debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as
preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any
insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency
creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as
unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the notes, among others, some important
consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German
Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime
would be the following:

   - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the insolvent entity would generally
pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the
insolvency estate, unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung);

   - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to
such insolvent entity, disposals effected by the management of such insolvent entity,
after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of
law;

   - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or
thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g.,
attachment) a security interest in part of such insolvent entity’s property that would
normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by
operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings;

   - claims against such insolvent entity may only be pursued in accordance with the rules
set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

   - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset
of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in
the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of
ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset
from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right
(Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate
in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and
creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only
enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any
security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however,
secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal
nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the
secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the
insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the
debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets
(Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to
collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen).
In the case of creditors secured by pledges over shares or company interests forming part of the
insolvency estate it is, in the absence of authoritative case law, uncertain whether the creditors
are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or

A-16


-----

whether the insolvency administrator has the right to realize the pledges on behalf of and for
the benefit of the secured creditors.

In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement
proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets
(Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the
aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are
disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount
equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the
insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger)
first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities
incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings).
Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims— Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of
unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value
remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the
preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full.

The preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) of a creditor may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such
use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain
creditors to be subordinated by law, while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the
insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally
rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the
insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of
other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully
satisfied.

The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other
unsubordinated claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to
their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the
claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs
incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings;
(iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental
legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money;
(iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; (v) claims for the
restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal
transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan; and (vi) claims which the creditor
and the debtor agreed to be subordinated in insolvency proceedings.

Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents
may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position”
(gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the insolvent entity. In that event, in an insolvency
proceeding over the assets of such insolvent entity, the claims against that entity would be
treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance
with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject
to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans will itself be exposed inter alia to a claw back
risk with respect to repayments that have been made within the period of one year prior to the
request to open insolvency proceedings or subsequent to such request (section 135 of the
German Insolvency Code). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the

A-17


-----

insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (or in any transaction security) unless the
insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated
insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed
by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from the transaction security was a
subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents
could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they
recover.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings aiming at the liquidation of the relevant insolvent
debtor, the value of the insolvent entity’s assets may be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the
case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach
aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan
(Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and
requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of each class of
creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court
(while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—be
crammed down). The insolvent entity itself may only oppose the proposed plan if the plan is
detrimental to the insolvent company (in comparison to an ordinary insolvency proceeding) or if
any creditor will receive a higher economic value than the amount of its claim. If the debtor is a
corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor
can be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a
transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). In this case, the adoption of the insolvency
plan generally also requires the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group
of dissenting shareholders can—under certain circumstances—also be crammed down.

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of
debtor-in-possession proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions,
performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were
effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable
voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided
by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged
transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate plus accrued
interest. The administrator’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances,
extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement
of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to any insolvent
entity based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts
to the holders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit
of the notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency
administrator under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the
holders of the notes may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the notes or the
Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If
payments have already been made under the notes or Collateral, any amounts received from a
transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid (plus accrued interest) to the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the notes may only have a
general unsecured claim under the notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term
includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt)

A-18


-----

detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency
Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain,
security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three
months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings,
provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken
and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the
debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of
such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing);

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain,
security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which
was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was
not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last
month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the
filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such
act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of
circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental effect);

   - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors
or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a
proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered
into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and
the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to
such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the
transaction;

   - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants
security for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

   - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted
with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche
_Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the_
time of such act. Such intention of the debtor and the respective knowledge of the
beneficiary shall be presumed if the debtor and the beneficiary knew of the debtor’s
imminent insolvency, and that the transaction constituted a disadvantage for the
creditors;

   - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that
directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract
was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to
corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations,
members of the management board or supervisory board, general partners and

A-19


-----

shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies
holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic
situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the
household of any of the foregoing persons;

   - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder
for repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of
security, the act took place during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the
case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition;
or

   - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically
equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to
the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a
shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or
provider of surety (Bürge) (in which case not the third party but the shareholder must
compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the
facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts
generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been
filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the
case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the
insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the
transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a
general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a
“cash transaction” (Bargeschäft). In case of such “cash transaction”, the avoidance risk can—
under certain circumstances— substantially be reduced.

The German legislature is currently discussing a draft amendment concerning the statutory
avoidance provisions in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Amendments are
envisaged with regards to, among others, the provisions for avoidance claims in connection
with willful disadvantage of the creditors, for cash transactions (Bargeschäfte) and the interest
rates on avoidance claims. It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or
modified form, this bill might be adopted by the German parliament.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained
an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or
payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of
Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary
to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated
from the date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees**

Each of the German Guarantors guaranteeing is established in the form of a German limited
liability company (“GmbH”) (each a “German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor”). Consequently, the
granting of a Note Guarantee by such German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor is subject to certain

A-20


-----

provisions relating to preservation of the statutory capital under the German Limited Liability
Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”).
These provisions would also apply to any future guarantor incorporated in the form of a GmbH
or established as a limited partnership with a limited liability company as general partner
(“GmbH & Co. KG”; the German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor, any future subsidiary of the
Issuer incorporated as a GmbH or established as a GmbH & Co. KG are hereinafter jointly
referred to as a “German Subsidiary Guarantors” and each a “German Subsidiary Guarantor”).

The enforcement of the Note Guarantee granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor to
secure the Issuer’s debt will be limited if, and to the extent, payments under the Note Guarantee
would cause the amount of such German Subsidiary Guarantor’s (or in the case the German
Subsidiary Guarantor is a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets (i.e., total assets less
liabilities and liability reserves) in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB)) to fall
below the amount of its stated share capital.

As a general rule, the provisions of the GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets
to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbHs net assets would fall below the
amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative amount of its net
assets would further be reduced and prohibit payments to shareholders which render the
German Subsidiary Guarantor unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Guarantees granted by a
German Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of liabilities or payments of a direct or indirect parent
or sister company as well as payments under any arrangements that are not at arm’s length
terms are considered disbursements under the provisions of the GmbHG.

In order to enable German Subsidiary Guarantors to grant Guarantees to secure liabilities of
a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating the provisions of the
GmbHG and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market
practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees to contain so called “limitation
language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a
GmbH & Co. KG.

Pursuant to such “limitation language,” the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to enforce
the guarantees against a German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG (or to release
the proceeds of an enforcement, as applicable) only if and to the extent that such enforcement
does not result in the subsidiary’s— or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—
net asset falling below the amount of its stated share capital or increasing such shortfall in order
to avoid a violation of the applicable provisions of the German GmbHG.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the documentation with respect to the
Note Guarantee, to the extent provided by a German Subsidiary Guarantor, contains or will
contain such contractual limitation language. This could lead to a situation in which the
respective Note Guarantee granted by such German Subsidiary Guarantor cannot be enforced
at all and the holders of the notes will lose the benefit of the Note Guarantee.

The German capital maintenance rules and the other provisions referred to above are
subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further
limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Subsidiary Guarantors, which can
negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the notes or of a German
Subsidiary Guarantors to make payments on the Note Guarantee. In addition, it cannot be ruled
out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so
called “destructive interference” (existenzvemichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a
shareholder deprives a German Subsidiary Guarantor of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its

A-21


-----

own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Note
Guarantee granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to
be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of
the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due
to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial
situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by
disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German
courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Note Guarantee by a German
Subsidiary Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the
stated share capital of the respective German Subsidiary Guarantor of the Note Guarantee could
become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act
with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in
violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be
present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that a
German Subsidiary Guarantor when granting the Note Guarantee was close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German subsidiary of the Issuer
based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) (or in the event debtor-in-possession status has been granted, the
preliminary trustee (Sachwalter) may possibly challenge (anfechten) under the rules of
avoidance as set out in the German insolvency code (Insolvenzordnung) (i) a guarantee granted
by that entity, (ii) payments that have been made (under the Note Guarantee), if such payments
have already been made. For details of such voidance rights, see “—Insolvency.”

**Creditor Liability**

The beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the
grantor of the guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be
the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing
the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of contra bonos
mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction
was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee has been close to
collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Under such
circumstances, the Note Guarantees may also be invalid.

**Hungary**

The notes will be guaranteed by VALEANT PHARMA Hungary LLC, a limited liability
company incorporated under the laws of Hungary, or the “Hungarian Guarantor”.

**Limitation on Enforceability**

In general, a Hungarian court will apply Hungarian private international law regime when
determining choice of law issues in respect of private law claims. Accordingly, the enforceability
of U.S. federal securities laws or judgments of U.S. courts (e.g., stay orders in moratorium) may
be decided on a case by case basis.

A-22


-----

A judgment in relation to any Note Guarantee obtained against the Hungarian Guarantor
from a New York Court will not be directly recognized by the Hungarian courts in the absence of
relevant reciprocity arrangement, bilateral or multilateral international agreements for the
mutual enforcement of civil law judgments or local law (at present none of them are available).
However, separate legal proceedings may be commenced in the Hungarian courts for an
amount due under a judgment given by the New York Courts and that judgment may be
deemed by the Hungarian courts in separate proceedings to be conclusive (as evidence or
otherwise) in Hungary as between the parties as to all relevant issues upon which it adjudicates.
The Hungarian courts have wide discretion, but recognition may be generally granted unless the
judgment can be impeached pursuant to Hungarian mandatory rules (e.g., the recognition and/
or enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to the public policy of Hungary, the relevant
court in the U.S. had no jurisdiction or generally accepted international procedural principals
have not been complied with).

The express choice of the laws of the State of New York is subject to mandatory provisions
of Hungarian law that in exceptional circumstances (e.g., breach of public policy, the choice
results in illegality or the choice is not bona fide) competent Hungarian courts may change,
invalidate or supplement (e.g., new terms of contract) certain provisions of the transaction
documents and/or related rights and/or obligations of the contracting parties.

The enforceability of obligations assumed by the Hungarian Guarantor are subject to
Hungarian corporate, bankruptcy and insolvency law that under exceptional circumstances
protecting the interest of the creditors and/ or minority owners may allow for a challenge of
certain obligations that may eventually lead to the nullification of agreements or certain
provisions (e.g., agreement to obtain security interest or receive pre-payments in a pre-petition
period with the intention to defraud or mislead other creditors, with liquidation challenge look
back periods of 5 years, 2 years, 90 days and 60 days). The successful challenge may even result
in the termination of registered pledges or repayment obligations or in setting aside various
contractual terms.

**Hungarian Insolvency Considerations**

Hungarian insolvency proceedings, including bankruptcy, liquidation and winding up
(voluntary liquidation) proceedings, are non-contentious proceedings and extend to all assets of
the Hungarian Guarantor existing on the commencement date.

**Bankruptcy**

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to make arrangements for the settlement of
creditors’ claims against a debtor. As part of bankruptcy proceedings, a debt moratorium lasting
between 120-360 days could be ordered by the competent bankruptcy court and consequently
any enforcement actions and most of the ordinary distributions would be suspended against the
Hungarian Guarantor until negotiations are underway. This would prevent the holders of the
notes from enforcing their security rights. If there is no agreement reached with the relevant
majority by the creditors classes, the court will order the commencement of liquidation
proceedings. The Hungarian bankruptcy regime does not support the parties reaching
agreement in this phase and, in practice, the vast majority of Hungarian bankruptcy proceedings
eventually turn into liquidation proceedings.

**Liquidation**

The purpose of liquidation proceedings is to satisfy the claims of creditors of an insolvent
debtor in the course of terminating a debtor without a legal successor. Subsequent to the

A-23


-----

commencement date of the liquidation, the ownership rights related to the Hungarian Guarantor
would fall away, the liquidator would legally and effectively take over the management of the
assets and activities of the company, any monetary or enforcement related claims against the
Hungarian Guarantor could only be enforced as part of the liquidation proceedings and all debt
of the Hungarian Guarantor would become due and payable.

Following a period of 40 days subsequent to the publication of the liquidation order, the
creditors and the debtor may, at any time, enter into a composition agreement with an aim to
settle and/or restructure their debt, before the submission date of the closing liquidation
balance-sheet. Upon the debtor’s request, the court shall hold a composition negotiation within
60 days following receipt of the petition. The debtor must prepare a schedule and an
appropriate proposal for the purpose of restoring its solvency.

During the negotiation, the debtor and the creditors may agree on:

(i) the order of satisfying the debts,

(ii) the modification of the deadline for the debt payments;

(iii) the ratio and manner of the satisfaction of the debts; and

(iv) all issues which are considered necessary by the parties for the purpose of restoring the
solvency of the debtor, in particular, measures increasing the revenues of the debtor.

The agreement may only be implemented if at least half of the creditors representing the
various classes of creditor claims consent and the total amount of claims of such creditors
reaches two thirds of the aggregate creditor claims.

In the absence of a restructuring agreement, the assets of the debtor shall be publicly
disposed (generally by a public auction) by the liquidator at the highest price that can be
obtained on the market. Under Hungarian insolvency law the sale proceeds of the Hungarian
Guarantor’s assets would be distributed in accordance with the following order of priority (the
list that follows is non-exhaustive):

(i) costs of the liquidation;

(ii) claims secured by pledge or mortgage before the initial date of liquidation;

(iii) alimonies, life-annuity payments, compensation allowance, mining salary supplements
payable by economic organizations, furthermore, monetary contributions granted to members
of agricultural cooperatives instead of household land or crops of which the beneficiary is
entitled to receive for a lifetime;

(iv) with the exception of claims based on bonds, other claims of private individuals not
originating from economic activities (in particular claims resulting from insufficient performance
or compensation for damages, also including the amount of the guarantee and warrantee
obligations ordinarily expected in the given trade, as calculated by the liquidator), claims of
small and micro companies and of agricultural primary producers and certain claims of the
Common Capital Maintenance Funds of Credit Cooperatives;

(v) debts of social insurance and private pension fund membership fees, taxes—with the
exception of tax debts that are classified as cost of liquidation—and public debts collectable as
taxes, repayable state aids and water and sewage fees;

A-24


-----

(vi) other claims; and

(vii) irrespective of the time and grounds of its occurrence, default interests and late
charges, and debts of fines and bonuses.

The costs of liquidation are as follows:

(i) wages and other similar benefits payable by the debtor—including severance pay due at
the termination of employment if the wages and other similar benefits became due prior to the
initial date of liquidation were paid after the initial date of liquidation, as well as the connected
tax and contribution obligations (including social security contributions and private pension
fund membership fees);

(ii) costs in connection with the rational completion of the economic activities of the debtor
following the initial date of liquidation, and furthermore, the costs connected to the protection
and maintenance of the debtor’s assets, including the costs of settling environmental damages
and burdens, and those credit debts, tax and contribution payment (including social security
contributions and private pension fund membership fees) and compensation obligations of the
debtor that are originated from economic activities after the initial date of liquidation, with the
exception of the taxes to be paid from the profits;

(iii) verified costs connected to the sale of the assets and the enforcement of claims;

(iv) aids received from the wage guarantee fund of Labour Market Fund and debited to the
debtor;

(v) costs incurred during the court and official proceedings in connection with liquidation,
payable by the debtor;

(vi) costs in connection with the arrangement, placement and safeguarding of the debtor’s
documents; (vii) liquidator’s fees; and

(viii) certain costs and expenses related to funds advanced by the state to mitigate or
manage environmental and other risks.

**Simplified Liquidation**

If the assets of the Hungarian Guarantor would not be sufficient even to cover the expected
costs of liquidation, or the proceedings are technically non-executable due to inadequate books
and records of the Hungarian Guarantor, upon the request of the liquidator, the court could
order the direct distribution of the assets and uncollected claims of the debtor to the creditors in
the above priority order prescribed by Hungarian insolvency law. Therefore, it cannot be
guaranteed that any holder of the notes could obtain monetary compensation under such
circumstances.

**Suspect Transactions**

The liquidator has wide powers to challenge certain declarations and agreements if they are
deemed to be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate and made prior and
subsequent to the filing of insolvency petition.

a) In particular, the liquidator may challenge any agreements or declarations made in a fiveyear period prior to the petition filing if the debtor conspired with the intention to mislead its
creditors and as a result the value of the debtor’s assets decreased.

A-25


-----

b) Certain transactions related to free disposal of assets, assumption of obligations without
consideration or with conditions that are obviously not at arm’s length can be challenged if
entered into in a two-year period prior to the filing of the petition.

c) If the debtor provides preferential treatment by declaration or an agreement to any of its
creditors in the last 90 days leading up to the petition, including an amendment of contract with
favourable terms to a creditor or provision of collateral to an unsecured creditor, the liquidator
may challenge such contract or declaration.

d) The pre-petition look back period is 60 days; if the liquidator finds that certain services or
voluntary prepayments were made to a creditor and such conduct cannot be considered to be
carried out in the ordinary course of business, the liquidator may reclaim these services or
payments.

If agreements are entered into between companies that are connected through direct or
indirect ownership, the Hungarian insolvency law operates under a legal assumption that such
agreements were entered into in bad faith and without consideration.

If a challenge is successful the relevant agreements or declarations could be avoided or
held unenforceable and other legal consequences of nullity would become applicable. If the
provision of the guarantee or Hungarian law governed collateral by the Hungarian Guarantor
would be challenged successfully, any related rights of the holders of the notes could be
terminated and payment made in the suspect periods would need to be repaid.

**Capital Maintenance Laws**

Current capital maintenance laws limit the rights of the Hungarian Guarantor to make a
distribution to its owners and basically require that such distribution be specifically authorized
by law and in general cannot lead or contribute to an insolvency situation. The interaction of
relevant capital maintenance and corporate benefit doctrines of the new Hungarian Civil Code
have not been tested yet. Therefore, the possibility that a future judicial practice specifically
addresses the collateral obligations assumed by a guarantor for the benefit of its direct or
indirect parents and requires that such an obligation be limited statutorily or contractually to a
level that does not endanger the liquidity of the grantor, thus effectively nullifying certain
obligations hitherto assumed by the Hungarian Guarantor, cannot be excluded.

**Trusts and Agents**

The direct recognition and enforceability of foreign law security trust or security agency
concepts in enforcement against assets held in Hungary is not possible.

**Ireland**

**Enforceability**

Certain guarantors of the notes are companies incorporated under the laws of Ireland (any
such guarantor, an “Irish Guarantor”).

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against any
Irish Guarantor in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state
securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would
recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against an Irish Guarantor or its
directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities
laws or hear actions against an Irish Guarantor or those persons based on those laws.

**Center of Main Interest**

Each Irish Guarantor has its registered office in Ireland and, as a result, there is a rebuttable
presumption that its center of main interest is in Ireland and consequently that any main
insolvency proceedings applicable to it would be governed by Irish law. If the center of main
interest of an Irish Guarantor is not located in Ireland, and is held to be in a different jurisdiction
within the European Union, main insolvency proceedings may not be opened in Ireland. Under
the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial or secondary proceedings may be commenced in other
Member States of the European Union (except Denmark) even if the center of main interests is
in Ireland; provided that the company has an establishment in that other Member State. The
effects of these secondary proceedings would be restricted to the assets of the relevant
company situated in that other Member State.

**Insolvency**

Irish insolvency law may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that an Irish
Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome
of insolvency or similar proceedings.

Any insolvency proceedings applicable to an Irish Guarantor will be likely to be governed by
Irish insolvency laws so long as the center of main interest of the Irish Guarantor is in Ireland.
Irish insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of any guarantee
granted by an Irish Guarantor, irrespective of the governing law or jurisdiction of such
guarantee. Where a guarantee is granted by an Irish Guarantor that is governed by the laws of
another country, the Irish court should apply that foreign law to the guarantee notwithstanding
that the Irish Guarantor has entered insolvency proceedings governed by Irish insolvency law.

Certain aspects of Irish insolvency law relating to limitations on a guarantee provided by a
company (such as an Irish Guarantor) could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce
their rights and, therefore, may affect the validity or enforceability of such guarantee and limit
the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the provider of such guarantee (such
as an Irish Guarantor).

**Liquidation**

Liquidation is a procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed
by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Irish Companies
Act (see “—Priorities of Claims on Liquidation”). A company can itself resolve to put itself into
liquidation (a ‘voluntary’ liquidation, being either a members’ voluntary liquidation if the
company is solvent or a creditors’ voluntary liquidation if insolvent) or a court can be petitioned
by creditors or contributors of a company to put the company into liquidation, being a court
liquidation. At the end of the liquidation process the company is dissolved.

In a liquidation, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against
the company except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose.

**_Priority of Claims on Liquidation_**

Under Irish insolvency law, the liabilities of a company such as an Irish Guarantor would be
paid only after certain of its other debts which are entitled to priority under Irish law, as set out
below.

A-27


-----

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

   - _First-ranking claims: remuneration, costs and expenses of an examiner where a_
company goes into liquidation after a failed examinership process that are approved by
a court (see “—Examinership”);

   - _Second-ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary_
interest in assets of the debtor company;

   - _Third-ranking claims: expenses certified by the examiner under section 529 of the Irish_
Companies Act being liabilities incurred by the company during the protection period
which the examiner deems necessary to allow the company to continue to operate
through the protection period, which certification may be reviewed by the court;

   - _Fourth-ranking claims: costs and expenses of the winding up of the company;_

   - _Fifth-ranking claims: liquidator’s fees;_

   - _Sixth-ranking claims: any sum which would have been deducted from the remuneration_
of an employee in respect of an employment contribution (as defined in the Social
Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 of Ireland) for a period of employment before a
winding-up had that remuneration been paid before the winding-up;

   - _Seventh-ranking claims: preferential creditors. Preferential debts include (but are not_
limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) certain pension
entitlements; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in a defined period
before the insolvency date, up to a maximum per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to
any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place
before or after the insolvency date. As between one another, preferential debts rank
equally;

   - _Eighth-ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of_
their security;

   - _Ninth-ranking claims: unsecured creditors;_

   - _Tenth-ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in_
full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the
insolvent company.

**Examinership**

Examinership is a court procedure available under the Irish Companies Act to facilitate the
survival of Irish companies in financial difficulty. Examinership is a rescue mechanism which
can be used by a company in financial difficulty where that company has a reasonable prospect
of survival, if restructured. It allows a company a period of protection from its creditors within
which time the examiner will endeavor to put together a survival plan. During this period of
protection no holders of guarantees or security may take any steps to enforce such guarantees
or security against the company. There are four primary pre-requisites to the appointment of an
examiner: (i) that the company is, or is likely to be, unable to pay its debts; (ii) that no resolution
subsists for the winding up of the company; (iii) that no order has been made for the winding up
of the company; and (iv) that there is a reasonable prospect of survival of the company as a
going concern.

In examinership, the scheme of arrangement can be approved involving the writing down
of the level of debts due from the company to the holders of guarantees. A compromise or
scheme of arrangement under an examinership may be implemented with the support of a

A-28


-----

majority in number (also representing a majority by value) of just one class of creditors subject
to confirmation by the Irish High Court that the compromise or scheme is not unfair or
inequitable or unfairly prejudicial to nonconsenting classes of creditors.

The primary risks to the holders of the notes if an examiner were appointed to an Irish
Guarantor are as follows:

   - the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the
writing down or rescheduling of any debt due by an Irish Guarantor;

   - the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the documents
pertaining to the notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings
by an Irish Guarantor to enable the examiner to borrow to fund an Irish Guarantor
during the protection period; and

   - in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and an Irish Guarantor
subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses
(including certain borrowings incurred by the examiner on behalf of an Irish Guarantor
and approved by the Irish High Court) will take priority over the monies and liabilities
which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by an Irish
Guarantor to, ultimately, the holders of the notes.

**Challenges to Guarantees and Security**

There are circumstances under Irish insolvency law in which transactions, including the
granting by an Irish company of guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise
if a liquidator is appointed to the company within a specified period of the granting of the
guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period a liquidator is appointed to a company, the
liquidator may challenge the validity of the guarantee given by such company. We cannot be
certain that, in the event of the onset of the insolvency of a provider of a guarantee (such as an
Irish Guarantor) if the main insolvency proceedings applicable to the provider would be
governed by Irish insolvency law that is within any of the requisite time periods set forth below,
the grant of any guarantee will not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction
as valid.

**_Fraudulent Preference_**

Under Irish insolvency law, a liquidator of a company could apply to the court for an order
to set aside a guarantee granted or a payment made by such company (or give other relief) on
the grounds such guarantee or payment constituted an unfair preference. The grant of a
guarantee or making of a payment is an unfair preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor
(or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s
insolvent liquidation than if the guarantee or payment had not been granted or made. For a
challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months
ending with the commencement of the liquidation if the beneficiary of the guarantee or
payment is not a “connected person”. The look back period is two years if the beneficiary is a
connected person. In addition, the company must have been insolvent at the time it gave the
preference or become unable to pay its debts as a result. A court will not make an order in
respect of an unfair preference of a person unless it is satisfied that the dominant intention of
the transaction was to prefer one creditor over other creditors. If the court determines that the
transaction was an unfair preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the
position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include
reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the guarantees). There is protection
for a third party that benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith and for value.

A-29

**_Improper Transfer / Transaction Having the Effect of a Fraud on Creditors_**

Irish insolvency law provides that when a company is insolvent or near insolvency its assets
are held for the benefit of its creditors. Pursuant to the Irish Companies Act, if it can be shown
on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound
up, to the satisfaction of the Irish High Court, that any property of that company was disposed of
(including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or mortgage) and the effect of such
a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on the company, its creditors or members, the Irish High
Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have
“use, control or possession” of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or
development of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the
liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit. There are also circumstances where a
creditor or receiver could invoke this provision of Irish law where a winding-up has not taken
place due to the lack of assets to fund a liquidation.

There is relatively little case law on the interpretation of these sections of the Irish
Companies Act. However, it is clear that the Irish High Court can apply a very wide
interpretation to the provision so as to allow virtually any kind of transaction to come within its
scope. It is also clear that the Irish High Court will not require the liquidator or creditor
challenging a transaction to prove intent to defraud creditors, rather they will only have to show
that the effect of the transaction was to perpetrate a fraud on creditors.

Notwithstanding the lack of judicial guidance, it is considered likely that the Irish High Court
would not regard a transaction as having the effect of a fraud upon creditors if the transaction
was concluded on market terms and not at an undervalue so that, in effect, the balance sheet of
the company concerned was not immediately adversely impacted following the completion of
the transaction.

Finally, it should be noted that in order for these provisions of the Irish Companies Act to
have any effect on the entry into of, or any payment under, any guarantee of the notes by the
Irish Guarantor, there must first be an insolvency of the Irish Guarantor (whether by virtue of
liquidation, receivership or an examinership).

**_Dispositions in Winding-up_**

Under the Irish Companies Act, any dispositions of a company’s property made after the
date of liquidation are void, unless the court orders otherwise.

**_Asset Swelling on Insolvency_**

Where there is a shortfall of available assets, the Irish Companies Act provides that on the
application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of a company that is being wound
up, the court, if it is satisfied that it is just and equitable to do so, may order that a company that
is or has been related to the company being wound up shall pay to the liquidator of that
company an amount equivalent to the whole or part of all or any of the debts provable in that
winding up. Any such order may be made on such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit.

The Irish Companies Act provides that, where two or more related companies are being
wound up under Irish insolvency law, and if the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to
do so, both companies may be wound up together as if they were one company (a “pooling
order”). A pooling order does not affect the rights of any secured creditor of any companies
which are subject to it.

A-30


-----

**Limitation on Enforcement**

The grant of a guarantee by an Irish incorporated company in respect of the obligations of
another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements including corporate benefit. A
director of an Irish incorporated company must act in the way that he considers, in good faith,
would be most likely to promote the success of an Irish incorporated company, as the case may
be, for the benefit of its members as a whole. If a company enters into a transaction where there
is no or insufficient commercial benefit, the transaction could be challenged as unenforceable.
Furthermore, the directors of the company may be found as abusing their powers as directors.

**Luxembourg**

**Registration in Luxembourg**

If any of the notes, indentures, guarantees, transaction documents (and any document in
connection therewith) is (i) voluntarily registered in Luxembourg or (ii) attached to a public deed
or to any other document that requires mandatory registration in Luxembourg, a registration fee
(droit d’enregistrement) will be due, the amount of which will depend on the nature of the
document(s) to be registered.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the notes, the
indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection
therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

**Insolvency Proceedings**

The notes will be guaranteed by Valeant International Luxembourg S.à r.l., Valeant
Pharmaceuticals Luxembourg S.à r.l., Valeant Holdings Luxembourg S.à r.l., Valeant Finance
Luxembourg S.à r.l., Biovail International S.à r.l. and Bausch & Lomb Luxembourg S.à r.l., which
are all incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg (each a “Luxembourg Guarantor” and
together, the “Luxembourg Guarantors”)

Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open main
insolvency proceedings with respect to the Luxembourg Guarantors, as entity having its
registered office and central administration (administration centrale) and centre of main interest
(“COMI”), as used in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), in the Grand Duchy
of Luxembourg, such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According
to the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI
in the jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office. As a result, there is a
rebuttable presumption that the COMI of the Luxembourg Guarantors is in the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg and consequently that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU
Insolvency Regulation) would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by
Luxembourg law.

However, the determination of where each of the Luxembourg Guarantors has its COMI is a
question of fact, which may change from time to time. EU Insolvency Regulation states that the
COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration
of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.

Certain privileges, such as the privileges of the Luxembourg tax authorities or social
security institutions over certain specific assets, may take precedence over any security or
privileges of other creditors of the Luxembourg Guarantors.

A-31


-----

The obligations of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be limited by general principles of
bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, reconstruction or other laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and, in particular:

   - during a gestion contrôlée (controlled management) procedure under the Grand-Ducal
Decree dated May 24, 1935 on the procedure of gestion contrôlée, the rights of secured
creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition
for controlled management;

   - the obligations of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected and, after their
performance, subject to annulment by a court on the basis of Article 445 of the
Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the documents entered into by the Luxembourg
Guarantors have been entered into during the hardening period (période suspecte)
(which is the period starting on the date determined by the bankruptcy court as being
the date on which the debtor is unable to pay its due and payable liabilities (the
“Cessation of Payments”) which cannot be earlier than 6 months before the date of the
bankruptcy judgment, and ending on the date of the bankruptcy judgment) or ten days
before. Such documents may come under Article 445 if they constitute or contain, or the
performance of such obligations thereunder would constitute (a) a contract for the
transfer of movable or immovable property done without consideration, or a contract or
transaction done with notably insufficient consideration for the insolvent party, or (b) a
payment, whether in cash or by transfer, assignment, sale, set-off or otherwise for debts
not yet due, or a payment other than in cash or bills of exchange for debts due, or (c) a
contractual or judiciary mortgage, pledge, or charge on the debtor’s assets for
previously contracted debts. Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce is not
applicable to valid financial collateral agreements subject to the law of 5 August 2005 on
financial collateral arrangements (as amended) (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”);

   - the obligations of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected and after their
performance, subject to annulment by a bankruptcy court on the basis of Article 446 of
the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the transaction constitute or contain, or the
performance of such obligations thereunder would constitute a payment for due debts
or an onerous act done by the Luxembourg Guarantors after the Cessation of Payments
(such date as determined by the bankruptcy court) and prior to the judgment opening
insolvency proceedings, if the counter-party that has received from or dealt with the
Luxembourg Guarantors had knowledge of the Cessation of Payments. Article 446 of the
Luxembourg Code of Commerce is not applicable to valid financial collateral
agreements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law;

   - regardless of the date of execution and performance, the documents entered into by the
Luxembourg Guarantors may be declared null and void in relation to the Luxembourg
Guarantors, if they have been entered into or issued with the fraudulent intent of the
parties thereto to deprive other creditors of the insolvent party of their rights (Article 448
of the Code of Commerce);

   - however the annulment of the documents entered into by the Luxembourg Guarantors
on the basis of articles 445, 446 or 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce may not
be pronounced, according to the EU Insolvency Regulation, if the person who benefited
from an act detrimental to all the creditors provides proof that (a) the said act is subject
to the law of a European Union Member State other than that of Luxembourg, and
(b) that law does not allow any means of challenging that act in the relevant case;

   - under Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, certain creditors of the insolvent party have
rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under
certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured creditors, and most

A-32


-----

of which are preferences arising by operation of law. This includes in particular the
rights relating to the fees and costs of the court appointed insolvency official as well as
any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, the rights of the
tax administration and certain assimilated parties (such as the social security
organisms), as well as certain other rights, which preferences may extend to all or part
of the assets of the insolvent party;

   - the obligations of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected or limited by the rights
of the receiver, liquidator or other court official appointed in the insolvency proceedings
to selectively perform contracts profitable to the insolvent party’s estate and renounce to
the performance of contracts which are not profitable to the insolvent party’s estate
(“cherry-picking”), where such contracts have not been terminated automatically by the
opening of the insolvency proceedings on the basis of an express contractual provision,
or by operation of law; the counterparty to that agreement (a) may enter a claim for
damages in the bankruptcy and such claim shall rank pari passu with claims of all other
unsecured creditors and/or (b) seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved;
it will, however, no longer be possible to seek injunctive relief or to require specific
performance.

**Continuance of On-Going Contracts**

The bankruptcy receiver (curateur) decides whether or not to continue performance under
ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver
may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the
authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors.
However, two exceptions apply:

   - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy
constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and

   - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party_
constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically
terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for
the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such
contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party
which are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by
the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a
claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other
unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The
counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.

**Fraudulent Conveyance**

Third parties (including, without limitation, any commissaire, juge-commissaire, liquidateur
or curateur or similar official) are also admitted to challenge certain acts of disposal viewed as
preferential transactions made by the Luxembourg Guarantors if, among other things, they can
show that the Luxembourg Guarantors have given “preference” to any person by defrauding
their rights (the rights of creditors generally), under the action paulienne (action pauliana), and
Luxembourg courts have the power to void the preferential transaction.

Finally, any international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management and
composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

A-33


-----

**Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees**

Any judgment awarded in the courts of Luxembourg may be expressed in a currency other
than the euro or the euro equivalent at the time of judgment or payment. However, any
obligation to pay a sum or money in any currency other than the euro will be enforceable in
Luxembourg in terms of the euro only. The granting of cross- or up-stream security interests
and guarantees by a Luxembourg company in order to secure the obligations of other entities
may raise some corporate benefit issues, in particular in relation to the corporate interest of the
Luxembourg company having to provide such security interests/guarantees. The Luxembourg
company law does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to
guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A Luxembourg company must
act for its own benefit (spécialité légale) and in its own corporate interest.

Whether an action is in the corporate interest of a company is a matter of fact not a legal
issue. The managers of a company are those who are able to assess whether such company has
a corporate benefit and interest in granting cross- or up-stream guarantees.

Under Luxembourg law, a company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the
guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate objects and in the best interest of the
company. The test regarding the guarantor’s corporate interest is whether the company that
provides the guarantee receives some consideration in return (such as an economic or
commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. A
guarantee that exceeds the guarantor company’s ability to meet its obligations to the
beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other creditors would expose its managers to personal
liability. It cannot ultimately be excluded that granting of guarantee, which would be considered
by a Luxembourg court as made in the absence of corporate interest, be declared void.

The Note Guarantee granted by the Luxembourg Guarantors may be limited to a certain
percentage of, among other things, the company’s own funds (capitaux propres) and intragroup indebtedness.

Finally, each of the Luxembourg Guarantors has been incorporated in the form of a private
limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée). Enforcement on these entities will
depend on their financial situation and will only be limited to their assets. Shareholders of a
private limited liability company cannot in principle be held liable for debts contracted by the
private limited liability company.
