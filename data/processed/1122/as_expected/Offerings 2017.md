##### OFFERING MEMORANDUM CONFIDENTIAL

### $750,000,000


# Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
### 5.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025

We are offering $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 as additional notes (the “new secured
notes”) under the indenture dated October 17, 2017 (the “October 2017 Indenture”), pursuant to which we previously issued $1,000 million
aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “initial secured notes” and, together with the new secured notes,
the “notes”). The new secured notes constitute a further issuance of, will have the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as (except for notes issued
pursuant to Regulation S which will bear a different CUSIP number for the first 40 days), and will be fungible with, the initial secured notes,
and form a single class of debt securities with the initial secured notes for all purposes under the October 2017 Indenture. Immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of the new secured notes by this offering memorandum, we will have $1,750 million aggregate principal
amount of our 5.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 outstanding.

Interest on the new secured notes will accrue from October 17, 2017 and will be payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year,
commencing on May 1, 2018. The notes will mature on November 1, 2025. We intend to use the net proceeds, along with cash on hand,
from this offering to repay (on a pro rata basis) a portion of our Series F Tranche B Term Loan Facility due 2022, and to pay related fees
and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds.”

The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after November 1, 2020, at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering memorandum. In addition, some or all of the notes may be redeemed prior to November 1, 2020, at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption plus a “make-whole” premium as
described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to November 1, 2020, up to 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of the notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this
offering memorandum.

The notes are initially guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the Credit Agreement (as defined herein) and of our
Existing Notes (as defined herein) (together, the “Note Guarantors”).

The notes and the guarantees will be secured senior obligations, subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, secured by the
same first priority liens that secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes (as defined herein), as
described under “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes.” The notes and the guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with
all of our and the Note Guarantors’ respective existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to our and their respective future
subordinated indebtedness. The notes and the guarantees will be effectively pari passu with our and the Note Guarantors’ respective existing
and future indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the Collateral (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) and effectively senior
to our and their respective existing and future indebtedness that is unsecured, including the Existing Senior Notes, or that is secured by
junior liens, in each case to the extent of the value of the Collateral. In addition, the notes will be structurally subordinated to (x) all liabilities
of any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes and (y) any of our debt that is secured by assets that are not Collateral.

We are not obligated under any registration rights agreement or other obligation to register the notes for resale or to exchange the notes
for notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. We
do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes in any automated quotation system.


_Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 20._

**Industry and Market Data**

This offering memorandum includes and incorporates by reference information with respect to market share,
ranking and industry conditions from third-party sources or based upon our estimates using such sources when
available. While we believe that such information and estimates are reasonable and reliable, we have not
independently verified any of the data from third-party sources, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can
guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the information. Similarly, our internal research is based upon our
understanding of industry conditions, and such information has not been verified by any independent sources.

Any estimates underlying such market-derived information and other factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from those expressed in the independent parties’ estimates and in our estimates.

**SEC and CSA Review**

We may receive comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the Canadian
Securities Administrators (the “CSA”) on the filings we make with the SEC and the CSA, respectively, that may
require us to modify the information incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the SEC or the CSA may issue
guidance relating to existing practice in the presentation of financial information or may promulgate new
regulations that may require modifications to the presentation of the information included in this offering
memorandum, including information incorporated herein by reference or in filings we make with the SEC or the
CSA, as the case may be. Any such modifications may be significant.

SEC rules regulate the use in filings with the SEC and certain of our other communications of “non-GAAP
financial measures”, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA
(as revised) and Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, which are derived on the basis of methodologies other
than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). We believe the financial
statements and other financial data included in this offering memorandum comply in all material respects with
GAAP and the regulations published by the SEC, with the exceptions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA (as revised), Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, net total debt and
net secured debt and ratios using such non-GAAP measures. Please see “Presentation of Financial Information”
and “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Information.”

**Presentation of Financial Information**

**Non-GAAP Financial Information**

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP
financial measures including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA (as revised),
Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, net total debt and net secured debt. The reconciliations of these
non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance
with GAAP are shown under “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information.”

Management uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics in the evaluation of Company performance and
the consolidated financial results and, in part, in the determination of cash bonuses for our executive officers. We
believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and
the valuation of our company. In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions we routinely receive
from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to similar data, we have

iii


-----

determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. However, non-GAAP financial
measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude certain items as described below.
Therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a
supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with
GAAP. In addition, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (as reported), Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) and Adjusted
EBITDA, as further adjusted, could differ in meaningful ways from the terms “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA”
and “Pro Forma Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” as those terms are defined in the Credit Agreement and
“Consolidated Cash Flow” as defined in the indenture.

EBITDA is net income attributable to the Company (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure)
adjusted for the following items: interest expense, net; provision for income taxes; and depreciation and
amortization.

Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for certain items, as further described below. The Company has
historically used Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its performance. Following an evaluation of the Company’s
financial performance measures, new management of the Company identified certain new primary financial
performance measures that it is now using to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. One of those
measures is Adjusted EBITDA, which the Company uses for both actual results and guidance purposes.
Management of the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, along with the other new measures, most
appropriately reflect how the Company measures the business internally and sets operational goals and
incentives, especially in light of the Company’s new strategies. In particular, the Company believes that Adjusted
EBITDA focuses management on the Company’s underlying operational results and business performance.

As a result, the Company is now using Adjusted EBITDA both to assess the actual financial performance of
the Company and to forecast future results as part of its guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to show our
unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational
factors. In addition, commencing in 2017, cash bonuses for the Company’s executive officers and other key
employees will be based, in part, on the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA targets.

Adjusted EBITDA reflects the adjustments below:

_Goodwill Impairment: The Company has excluded the impact of goodwill impairment. When the Company_
has made acquisitions where the consideration paid was in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired, the
remaining purchase price is booked as goodwill. For assets that we developed ourselves, no goodwill is booked.
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment. Goodwill is impaired when an impairment test indicates
that the implied fair value of the goodwill acquired has fallen below its carrying value. Management excludes
these charges in measuring the performance of the Company and the business.

_Restructuring and integration costs: Prior to 2016, the Company completed a number of acquisitions, which_
resulted in operating expenses which varied significantly from period to period and which would not otherwise
have been incurred. The type, nature, size and frequency of the Company’s acquisitions have varied considerably
from period to period. As a result, the type and amount of the restructuring, integration and deal costs have also
varied significantly from acquisition to acquisition. In addition, the costs associated with an acquisition varied
significantly from quarter to quarter, with most costs generally decreasing over time. Consequently, given the
variability and volatility of these costs from acquisition to acquisition and period to period and because these
costs are incremental and directly related to the acquisition, the Company does not view these costs as normal
operating expenses. Furthermore, due to the volatility of these costs and due to the fact that they are directly
related to the acquisitions, the Company believes that such costs should be excluded when assessing or
estimating the long-term performance of the acquired businesses or assets as part of the Company. Also, the size,
complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drove the magnitude of such expenses, were not
necessarily indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions. In addition, since 2016
and for the foreseeable future, while the Company has undertaken fewer acquisitions, the Company has incurred

iv


-----

(and anticipates continuing to incur) additional restructuring costs as it implements its new strategies, which will
involve, among other things, internal reorganizations and divestitures of assets and businesses. The amount, size
and timing of these costs fluctuates, depending on the reorganization or transaction and, as a result, the Company
does not believe that such costs (and their impact) are representative of the underlying business. In each case, by
excluding these expenses from its non-GAAP measures, management believes it provided supplemental
information that assisted investors with their evaluation of the Company’s ability to utilize its existing assets and
with its estimation of the long-term value that acquired assets would generate for the Company. Furthermore, the
Company believes that the adjustments of these items provided supplemental information with regard to the
sustainability of the Company’s operating performance, allowed for a comparison of the financial results to
historical operations and forward-looking guidance and, as a result, provided useful supplemental information to
investors.

_Acquired in-process research and development costs: The Company has excluded expenses associated with_
acquired in-process research and development, as these amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and
are significantly impacted by the timing, size and nature of acquisitions. Furthermore, as these amounts are
associated with research and development acquired, they are not a representation of the Company’s research and
development efforts during the period.

_Asset Impairments: The Company has excluded the impact of impairments of finite-lived and indefinite-_
lived intangibles, as well as impairments of assets held for sale, as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and
frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company
believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the Company’s operating
performance. Although the Company excludes intangible impairments from its non-GAAP expenses, the
Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue
generation.

_Share-based compensation: The Company excludes the impact of costs relating to share-based_
compensation. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense assists investors
in the comparison of operating results to peer companies. Share-based compensation expense can vary
significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted.

_Acquisition-related adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets and depreciation expense: The_
Company has excluded the impact of acquisition-related contingent non-cash consideration adjustments due to
the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with
respect to fair value estimates, and the amount and frequency of such adjustments is not consistent and is
significantly impacted by the timing and size of the Company’s acquisitions, as well as the nature of the agreedupon consideration. In addition, the Company has excluded the impact of fair value inventory amortization
step-up resulting from acquisitions as the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent and are
significantly impacted by the timing and size of its acquisitions.

_Loss on extinguishment of debt: The Company has excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this_
represents a cost of refinancing our existing debt and is not a reflection of our operations for the period. Further,
the amount and frequency of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and
size of debt financing transactions and other factors in the debt market out of management’s control.

_Foreign exchange and other: For periods prior to 2017, the Company excluded the impact of foreign_
currency fluctuations primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements in evaluating Company
performance. As of the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA no longer excludes foreign exchange gains and
losses arising from intercompany transactions. Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) includes the foreign exchange
gain/loss arising from intercompany transactions for all periods presented.

_Other Non-GAAP Charges: The Company has excluded certain other amounts including integration related_
inventory and technology transfer costs, CEO termination costs, legal and other professional fees incurred in

v


-----

connection with recent legal and governmental proceedings, investigations and information requests respecting
certain of our distribution, marketing, pricing, disclosure and accounting practices, litigation and other matters,
net (gain)/loss on the sale of assets, acquisition-related transaction costs and certain costs associated with the
wind-down of the arrangements with Philidor Rx Services, LLC (“Philidor”). In addition, the Company has
excluded certain other expenses that are the result of other, non-comparable events to measure operating
performance. These events arise outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Given the unique nature
of the matters relating to these costs, the Company believes these items are not normal operating expenses. For
example, legal settlements and judgments vary significantly, in their nature, size and frequency, and, due to this
volatility, the Company believes the costs associated with legal settlements and judgments are not normal
operating expenses. In addition, as opposed to more ordinary course matters, the Company considers that each of
the recent proceedings, investigations and information requests, given their nature and frequency, are outside of
the ordinary course and relate to unique circumstances. The Company believes that the exclusion of such
out-of-the-ordinary-course amounts provides supplemental information to assist in the comparison of the
financial results of the Company from period to period and, therefore, provides useful supplemental information
to investors. However, investors should understand that many of these costs could recur and that companies in
our industry often face litigation.

Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, is Adjusted EBITDA (as revised) after giving effect to the sale of the
Company’s CeraVe[®], AcneFree™and AMBI[®] skincare brands (the “Skincare Sale”), the sale of all outstanding
equity interests in Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Dendreon” and such sale, the “Dendreon Sale”), the sale of
our iNova Pharmaceuticals business (“iNova” and such sale, the “iNova Sale”) and the sale of our Obagi Medical
Products, Inc. business (“Obagi” and such sale, the “Obagi Sale”). The Skincare Sale was completed on March 3,
2017 and the Company no longer holds the rights to these three products. The CeraVe[®], AcneFree™and AMBI[®]
skincare brands involved in the Skincare Sale contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $30 million for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. The Dendreon Sale was completed on June 28, 2017 and this
business contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $95 million for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2017. The iNova Sale was completed on September 29, 2017, and this business contributed
Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $125 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. The Obagi
Sale was completed on November 9, 2017, and this business contributed Adjusted EBITDA of approximately
$30 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted, does not
give effect to the sale of our Sprout Pharmaceuticals, Inc. business (“Sprout”) to a buyer affiliated with certain
former shareholders of Sprout (the “Sprout Sale”), in exchange for a 6% royalty on global sales of Addyi[®]
(flibanserin 100 mg) beginning May 2019. The Sprout Sale is expected to close in 2017, subject to customary
closing conditions, including the approval of the requisite portion of the former shareholders of Sprout to the
amendments to the original merger agreement.

**Recent Evaluation of Financial Performance Measures**

Recently, the Company’s new management team undertook an evaluation of how it would measure the
financial performance of the Company going forward. In evaluating its financial performance measures, the
Company considered its recent changes to its strategy (which included a transition away from growth by
acquisition with a greater focus on research and development (“R&D”) activity, strengthening of the balance
sheet through the paydown of debt and rationalization of the product portfolio through divestitures of non-core
assets) and sought to identify performance measures that best reflect the Company’s current business operations,
strategy and goals. As a result of that evaluation, new management identified the following primary financial
performance measures for the Company: GAAP Revenues (measure for both guidance and actual results), GAAP
Net Income (measure for actual results), Adjusted EBITDA (measure for both guidance and actual results) and
GAAP Cash Flow from Operations (measure for actual results). These measures were selected as the Company
believes that these measures most appropriately reflect how the Company measures the business internally and
sets operational goals and incentives. For example, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA focuses
management on the Company’s underlying operational results and business performance, while GAAP Revenue
focuses management on the overall growth of the business.

vi


-----

In addition, in connection with this evaluation of financial performance measures, the Company assessed the
methodology with which it was calculating non-GAAP measures and made updates where it deemed appropriate
to better reflect the underlying business. For example, commencing with the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted
EBITDA no longer includes adjustments for Foreign exchange gain/loss arising from intercompany transactions.

The Company began to use these new non-GAAP measures, and the new methodologies used to calculate
these non-GAAP measures, commencing with the first quarter of 2017. See “Summary—Summary Historical
Consolidated Financial and Other Information.”

**Financial Information With Respect to Note Guarantors and Stock Pledges**

In an offering registered with the SEC, Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X would require the inclusion in the notes to
our consolidated financial statements of consolidating balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive
income and statements of cash flows for the Issuer, the guarantors and the non-guarantors, and Rule 3-16 of
Regulation S-X would require the inclusion of financial statements for certain subsidiaries whose stock is pledged to
secure the notes. In lieu of the information that would be required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, we have
included elsewhere certain quantitative data in respect of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. For so long as any notes
remain outstanding, we will make available, upon request, to any holder and any prospective purchaser of notes the

**SUMMARY**

_The following summary should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the more_
_detailed information and financial statements (including the accompanying notes) appearing elsewhere in this_
_offering memorandum or incorporated by reference herein. To understand this offering fully, you should read_
_carefully the entire offering memorandum and the information incorporated by reference herein, including the_
_section of this offering memorandum entitled “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking_
_Statements.”_

_All references in this offering memorandum to “$” are to U.S. dollars._

**The Company**

We are a multinational, specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company that develops, manufactures,
and markets a broad range of branded, generic and branded generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (“OTC”)
products, and medical devices (contact lenses, intraocular lenses, ophthalmic surgical equipment, and aesthetics
devices), which are marketed directly or indirectly in approximately 100 countries. We are diverse not only in
our sources of revenue from our broad drug and medical device portfolio, but also among the therapeutic classes
and geographies we serve.

The Company’s portfolio of products falls into three reportable segments: (i) Bausch + Lomb/International,
(ii) Branded Rx, and (iii) U.S. Diversified Products.

   - _The Bausch + Lomb/International segment consists of: (i) sales in the U.S. of pharmaceutical products,_
OTC products and medical device products, primarily comprised of Bausch + Lomb products, with a
focus on the Vision Care, Surgical, Consumer and Ophthalmology Rx products, and (ii) sales in Canada,
Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East of branded
pharmaceutical products, branded generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products, medical device
products, and Bausch + Lomb products.

   - _The Branded Rx segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) Salix products (gastrointestinal (“GI”)_
products), (ii) Ortho Dermatologics (dermatological products) and (iii) oncology (or Dendreon),
dentistry and women’s health products. As a result of the Dendreon Sale completed on June 28, 2017,
the Company exited the oncology business.

   - _The U.S. Diversified Products segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) pharmaceutical products, OTC_
products and medical device products in the areas of neurology and certain other therapeutic classes,
including aesthetics which includes the Solta business and the Obagi business sold on November 9,
2017 and (ii) generic products.

**Business Strategy**

Our strategy is to focus our business on core geographies and therapeutic classes that offer attractive growth
opportunities. Within our chosen therapeutic classes and geographies, we prioritize durable products which have
the potential for strong operating margins and evidence of growth opportunities. The growth of our business is
further augmented through our lower risk, output-focused R&D model, which allows us to advance certain
development programs to drive future commercial growth, while creating efficiencies in our R&D efforts.

**Key Initiatives**

Prior to 2016, we had completed a series of mergers and acquisitions which were key to the Company’s
previous strategy for growth. The Company has transitioned away from a focus on acquisitions, has taken steps


1


-----

to stabilize its business and has begun placing greater emphasis on a select number of internal R&D projects. The
Company’s key initiatives include: (i) concentrating our focus on core businesses where we believe we have an
existing and sustainable competitive edge, (ii) identifying opportunities to improve operational efficiencies and
reviewing our internal allocation of capital and (iii) strengthening the Company’s balance sheet and capital
structure.

In 2017, we have continued to execute on these key initiatives. We have better defined our core businesses,
shifted our operations toward those core businesses and made measurable progress in strengthening our balance
sheet.

_Focus on Core Businesses—We believe that there is significant opportunity in the eye health and branded_
prescription pharmaceutical businesses. Our existing portfolio, commercial footprint and pipeline of product
development projects are expected to position us to compete and be successful in these markets. As a result, we
believe these businesses provide us with the greatest opportunity to build value for our stakeholders. In order to
focus our efforts, in 2016, we performed a review of our portfolio of assets to identify those areas where we
believe we have, and can maintain, a competitive advantage and we continue to define and shape our business
around these assets. We identify these areas as “core”, meaning that we are best positioned to grow and develop
them. By narrowing our focus, we have the opportunity to reduce complexity in our business and maximize the
value of our core businesses. We describe our core areas by business and by geography. Within our Branded Rx
segment, our core businesses include gastrointestinal (“GI”) (or Salix) and dermatology. We also view our global
eye health business, within our Bausch + Lomb/International segment, as core. Although the business units that
fall outside our definition of “core” assets may be solid, the focus of their product pipelines and geographic
footprint are not fully aligned with the focus of our core business, and they are, therefore, at a disadvantage when
competing against our core activities for resources and capital within the Company.

_Internal Capital Allocation and Operating Efficiencies—In support of the key initiatives outlined above, in_
2016, a new leadership team was recruited and many of the executive roles were realigned or expanded to drive
value in our product portfolio and generate operational efficiencies. Beginning in the latter half of 2016, the
leadership team began to address a number of issues affecting performance and other operational matters. These
operational matters included:

   - Sales Force Stabilization—We believe that new leadership and the enhanced focus on core assets have
enabled the Company to recruit and retain stronger talent for its sales initiatives. We continue to focus
on stabilizing our sales forces, which, in turn, will allow us to deliver more consistent and concise
messages in the marketplace.

   - Patient Access and Pricing Committee and New Pricing Actions—In May 2016, we formed the Patient
Access and Pricing Committee responsible for setting, changing and monitoring the pricing of our
Branded Rx and other pharmaceutical products. Following this committee’s recommendation, we
implemented an enhanced rebate program to all hospitals in the U.S. to reduce the price of our
Nitropress[®] and Isuprel[®] products. In October 2016, the Patient Access and Pricing Committee
approved 2% to 9% increases to our gross selling price (wholesale acquisition cost or “WAC”) for
products in our neurology, GI and urology portfolios. The changes are aligned with the Patient Access
and Pricing Committee’s commitment that the average annual price increase for our prescription
pharmaceutical products will be set at no greater than single digits and below the 5-year weighted
average of the increases within the branded biopharmaceutical industry. In addition, in 2016, no pricing
increases were taken on our dermatology and ophthalmology products and, in 2016, net pricing of our
dermatology and ophthalmology products, after taking into account the impact of rebates and other
adjustments, decreased by greater than 10% on average. On April 21, 2017, the Company announced
that, following the evaluation and approval of the Patient Access and Pricing Committee, it had decided
to list Siliq™injection at $3,500 per month, which represented the lowest-priced injectable biologic

psoriasis treatment based on total annual costs on the market at the time of the announcement. In the
future, we expect that the Patient Access and Pricing Committee will implement or recommend
additional price changes and/or new programs to enhance patient access to our drugs and that these
pricing changes and programs could affect the average realized pricing for our products and may have a
significant impact on our revenue trends.

The ranking of our business units during 2016 changed our view of how capital should be allocated across
our activities. Our first step was to review each business unit, consider and assess the appropriate levels of
operating expense, and to eliminate non-productive costs. As a result of that review, we identified significant cost
savings opportunities.

To position the Company to drive the value of our core assets, we made a number of leadership changes and
took steps to increase our promotional efforts, particularly in GI, and increase our commitment to research and
development.

The GI unit initiated a significant sales force expansion program in December 2016 to reach potential
primary care physician (“PCP”) prescribers of Xifaxan[®] for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (“IBS-D”)
and Relistor[®] tablets for opioid induced constipation (“OIC”). In the first quarter of 2017, we hired
approximately 250 trained and experienced sales force representatives and managers to create, bolster and sustain
deep relationships with PCPs. With approximately 70 percent of IBS-D patients initially presenting with
symptoms to a PCP, we believe that the dedicated PCP sales force will be positioned to reach more patients in
need of IBS-D treatment. The investment in these additional sales resources, including an increase in associated
promotional costs, is expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, as we believe this spend is needed
to allow us to capitalize on the full potential of Xifaxan[®]. The costs of this investment in our GI unit reduced our
operating results in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 and we have begun experiencing
incremental revenue for Xifaxan[®]. In addition, we have expanded our dedicated pain sales representatives to
strengthen our position in the OIC market, and established a nurse educator team to educate clinical staff within
top institutions.

Our R&D organization focuses on the development of products through clinical trials and consists of
approximately 1,000 dedicated R&D and quality assurance employees in 18 R&D facilities. Currently, we have
over 100 R&D projects in the pipeline and we have launched or expect to launch and/or relaunch over 120
products during 2017. In 2016, we increased our R&D expenditures by 26% over our R&D expenditures in 2015,
as we began the transition away from the Company’s previous growth by acquisition strategy and moved toward
our organic growth supported by investment in R&D strategy. Although R&D expenses for the nine months
ended September 30, 2017 were $271 million and were lower when compared to R&D expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 of $328 million, as a percentage of revenues R&D expenses remain between
4% and 5% in 2017 and 2016 and demonstrates our consistent commitment to our investment in R&D strategy.
The decrease in dollars spent is attributable to the year over year phasing as we completed the R&D investment
in Siliq™and other newly launched products requiring investment in the prior year, removed projects related to
divested businesses and rebalanced our portfolio to better align with our long-term plans.

Core assets that have received a significant portion of our R&D investment are:

   - _Dermatology—On July 27, 2017, we launched Siliq™in the U.S. Siliq™is an IL-17 receptor blocker_
monoclonal antibody biologic for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, which we estimate
to be an over $5,000 million market in the U.S. The FDA approved the Biologics License Application
(“BLA”) for Siliq™injection, for subcutaneous use for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque
psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and have failed to
respond or have lost response to other systemic therapies. Siliq™has a Black Box Warning for the risks

in patients with a history of suicidal thoughts or behavior and was approved with a Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategy involving a one-time enrollment for physicians and one-time informed consent for
patients.

- _Dermatology—IDP-118 is the first and only topical lotion that contains a unique combination of_
halobetasol propionate and tazarotene for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults.
Halobetasol propionate and tazarotene are each approved to treat plaque psoriasis when used separately,
but are limited in duration of use. Halobetasol propionate may be used for up to two weeks and
tazarotene may be limited due to irritation. Based on existing data from clinical studies, the combination
of these ingredients in IDP-118 with a dual mechanism of action, potentially allows for expanded
duration of use, with reduced adverse events. On September 5, 2017, we announced that we had
submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for IDP-118 to the FDA which included data from two
successful Phase 3 clinical trials. On November 2, 2017, we announced that the FDA had accepted the
NDA for review, and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) action date of June 18, 2018.

- _Dermatology—IDP-122 is a novel psoriasis product, for which we expect to file an NDA in 2017._

- _Dermatology—IDP-121 is a novel acne product, for which we expect to file an NDA in 2017._

- _Dermatology—IDP-123 is an acne product containing lower concentration of tazarotene in a lotion form_
to help reduce irritation while keeping efficacy currently in Phase 3 testing.

- _Dermatology—IDP-120 is an acne product with a fixed combination of mutually incompatible_
ingredients; benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin. We plan to begin Phase 3 testing of this product in the first
half of 2018.

- _Dermatology— IDP-126 is an acne product with a fixed combination of benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin_
phosphate and adapalene currently in Phase 2 testing.

- _Gastrointestinal—A new formulation of rifaximin, which we acquired as part of the Salix Acquisition,_
is scheduled to begin Phase 2b/3 testing in 2017.

- _Eye Health—Luminesse™(provisional name) (brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution, 0.025%) is_
being developed as an ocular redness reliever. On February 27, 2017, we filed the NDA for
Luminesse™with the FDA. In May 2017, we announced that the FDA had accepted the NDA for
review, and set a PDUFA action date of December 27, 2017.

- _Eye Health— Vyzulta™(latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution, 0.024%) is an intraocular pressure_
lowering single-agent eye drop dosed once daily for patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular
hypertension. In September 2015, we announced that the FDA had accepted for review the NDA for this
product and set a PDUFA action date of July 21, 2016. On July 22, 2016, we announced that we had
received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the FDA regarding the NDA for this product. On
February 24, 2017 we refiled the NDA and, on August 7, 2017, we received another CRL from the FDA
regarding the NDA for this product. The concerns raised by the FDA in both CRLs pertain to the
findings of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) inspections at our manufacturing facility in
Tampa, Florida where certain deficiencies were identified by the FDA. However, neither CRL identified
any efficacy or safety concerns with respect to this product or additional clinical trials needed for the
approval of the NDA. On August 16, 2017, we announced that the FDA confirmed that all issues related
to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice inspection at the Tampa, Florida facility are being
satisfactorily resolved, and a Voluntary Action Indicated inspection classification has since been issued
by the FDA for this facility. Then on November 2, 2017, we announced that the FDA approved the
NDA for Vyzulta™. We expect to launch Vyzulta™in 2017.

- _Eye Health—Vitesse™is a novel technology using ultrasonic energy for vitreous removal with reduced_
surgical trauma. On April 26, 2017, Vitesse™received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. We expect to
launch this product in 2017.

Our investment in R&D reflects our commitment to drive organic growth through internal development of
new products, a pillar of our new strategy.

_Strengthening the Balance Sheet/Capital Structure—We have made measurable progress in reducing our_
debt level, improving our capital structure and generating additional liquidity for our operations. Using our cash
flows from operations and the net cash proceeds from sales of certain non-core assets, during the period from
January 1, 2016 through the date of this offering memorandum, we repaid (net of additional borrowings) over
$5,300 million of long-term debt, which includes over $1,200 million of repayments made after September 30,
2017 using the net proceeds from the iNova Sale and the Obagi Sale, along with cash on hand. In addition, in
March 2017 and October 2017, we accessed the credit markets and completed a series of transactions to improve
our capital structure, whereby we extended the maturities of certain debt obligations originally scheduled to
mature in the years 2018 through 2020 out to April 2020 and beyond. Our repayments through the date of this
offering memorandum, and the refinancings we completed in March 2017 and October 2017 have eliminated any
further mandatory principal long-term debt repayments until March 2020, providing us with additional liquidity
and greater flexibility to execute our business plans. Our reduced debt levels and improved debt portfolio will
translate to lower payments of principal over the next three years, which in turn should free up cash flows to be
directed toward developing our core assets and repaying additional debt amounts.

We continuously evaluate opportunities to address certain of our outstanding indebtedness, including
refinancing certain of our series of unsecured notes in whole or in part. The ability to refinance any such
indebtedness will depend on market conditions and other factors at such time and may include the issuance of
unsecured debt securities, potentially in the near-term. No assurances can be made as to whether or not any such
issuances will occur or, if they do, the price or interest rate at which any such debt securities would be issued,
what debt would be refinanced or the price at which any such refinancing would be completed.

**Recent Developments**

On September 29, 2017, we completed the iNova Sale for $938 million in cash, subject to certain working
capital provisions. iNova markets a diversified portfolio of weight management, pain management, cardiology
and cough and cold prescription and over-the-counter products in more than 15 countries, with leading market
positions in Australia and South Africa, as well as an established platform in Asia. iNova revenues were
$196 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and were $246 million and $252 million during the
years 2016 and 2015, respectively. On October 5, 2017, the net proceeds of the iNova Sale were used to repay

-----

$923 million aggregate principal amount of our Series F Tranche B Term Loan Facility due 2022 (the “iNova
Paydown”). Following the iNova Paydown, there are no further quarterly amortization payments required under
our senior secured credit facilities.

On October 17, 2017 we issued $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% Senior Secured
Notes due 2025 (the “Secured Notes Issuance”).

On October 17, 2017, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, our wholly-owned Delaware incorporated
subsidiary, repurchased $431 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 7.000% Senior Notes due
2020 and $569 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 pursuant to
previously announced tender offers (the “2020 Notes Repurchase”).

On November 2, 2017, we repaid $125 million of Series F Tranche B Term Loan Facility due 2022, using
cash on hand (the “Term Loan Paydown”).

On November 6, 2017, we announced we had entered into a definitive agreement relating to the Sprout Sale.
In connection with the completion of the Sprout Sale, the terms of the October 2015 merger agreement relating to
our acquisition of Sprout will be amended to terminate our ongoing obligation to make future royalty payments
associated with the Addyi[®] product, as well as certain related provisions (including the obligation to make
certain marketing and other expenditures). In connection with the completion of the Sprout Sale, the current
litigation against us, initiated on behalf of the former shareholders of Sprout, which disputes our compliance with
certain contractual terms of that same merger agreement with respect to the use of certain diligent efforts to
develop and commercialize the Addyi[®] product (including a disputed contractual term with respect to the spend
of no less than $200 million in certain expenditures), will be dismissed with prejudice. Upon completion of the
Sprout Sale, we will issue the buyer a five-year $25 million loan for initial operating expenses. Addyi[®], a oncedaily, non-hormonal tablet approved for the treatment of acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder
in premenopausal women, is the only approved and commercialized product of Sprout. The Sprout Sale is
expected to close in 2017, subject to certain closing conditions, including the approval of the requisite portion of
the former shareholders of Sprout to the amendments to the original merger agreement.

On November 9, 2017, we completed the Obagi Sale for $190 million in cash, subject to certain working
capital provisions. Obagi revenues were $60 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and were
$71 million and $91 million during the years 2016 and 2015, respectively. On November 10, 2017, the net
proceeds of the Obagi Sale were used to repay $181 million aggregate principal amount of our Series F Tranche
B Term Loan Facility due 2022 (the “Obagi Paydown”).

We refer to the iNova Paydown, the Secured Notes Issuance, the 2020 Notes Repurchase, the Term Loan
Paydown and the Obagi Paydown as the “Recent Developments Transactions.”

**Credit Facility Amendment and Repricing**

On November 9, 2017, we launched an amendment and repricing of the term loans that will remain
outstanding under our Credit Agreement after giving effect to this offering and the application of the proceeds
thereof (the “Credit Agreement Amendment”). We intend to seek a reduction in interest rate on our current Series
F Tranche B Term Loan (the “Series F Tranche B Term Loan”) maturing in 2022 pursuant to a refinancing of all
Series F Tranche B Term Loans outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the new secured notes and the
application of the proceeds thereof) into a new Series F-4 Tranche B Term Loan (the “Series F-4 Tranche B
Term Loan”). The Series F-4 Tranche B Term Loan would thereafter be the only tranche of term loans
outstanding under the Credit Facility, and would have terms identical to the currently outstanding Series F
Tranche B Term Loans, other than a reduction in interest rate and certain other changes referred to in the Credit

Agreement Amendment. We are also seeking an increase to the letter of credit sublimit under the revolving
facility provided for in our Credit Agreement and increased flexibility for treasury-related transactions. We have
offered a soft call premium of 1.00% for a period of six months.

The Credit Agreement Amendment is subject to market and other conditions. Closing of the Credit
Agreement Amendment is not a condition to the closing of this offering. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to successfully complete the Credit Agreement Amendment on the terms described above, or at all.

We refer to this offering collectively with the subsequent Credit Facility Amendment and Repricing as the
“Transactions.”

**The Offering**

The following summary contains basic information about the notes. For a more complete understanding of
the notes and this offering, see “Description of the Notes.”

Issuer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.

Notes Offered. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Secured
Notes due 2025.

The new secured notes are being offered as additional notes under the
October 2017 Indenture pursuant to which we previously issued the
initial secured notes. The new secured notes constitute a further
issuance of, and will be fungible with, the initial secured notes and
will bear the same CUSIP numbers as the initial secured notes except
for notes issued pursuant to Regulation S which will bear a different
CUSIP number for the first 40 days. The new secured notes will form
a single class of debt securities with the initial secured notes for all
purposes under October 2017 Indenture. Immediately after giving
effect to the issuance of the new secured notes by this offering
memorandum, we will have outstanding $1,750 million in aggregate
principal amount of 5.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025.

Maturity Date . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will mature on November 1, 2025.

Interest. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per annum payable
semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing
May 1, 2018. Interest will accrue from October 17, 2017.

Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes are initially jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior
secured basis by each of our subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the
Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Notes and our existing senior
unsecured notes (the “Existing Senior Notes” and, together with the
Existing Secured Notes, the “Existing Notes”). The guarantee of any
subsidiary may be released under certain circumstances as described
under “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.”

Certain Note Guarantees may be subject to certain limitations. See
“Risk Factors—Each guarantee will be subject to certain limitations
on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to
certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.
Applicable U.S. and Canadian laws allow courts, under certain
circumstances, to void the notes or the guarantees and any related
security or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes
such that the resources of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors may not
be available to make payments in respect of the notes.”

Collateral. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Company and the Note Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions,
granted (or will grant) liens on a first-priority basis on substantially
all of their tangible and intangible assets, now owned or hereafter

acquired, that secure borrowings under the Credit Agreement, in favor
of the relevant Notes Collateral Agent (as defined herein) and the
Existing Secured Notes, pursuant to certain security documents (the
“Collateral Documents”). The Collateral excludes certain Excluded
Assets (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) and certain
assets of certain subsidiaries organized in various foreign jurisdictions
(including tangible assets in Germany, accounts receivable and
assignments of rights under contracts in Germany and Poland,
accounts receivable and assets the subject of an assignment in the
United Arab Emirates, pledges of shares in Italian and United Arab
Emirates companies) where applicable law does not permit the grant
or simultaneous perfection of liens to a subsequent secured party
beyond the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or where the grant of
such liens to a subsequent secured party is inconsistent with local
practice. There is also a risk that certain asset pledges in Colombia
may be determined to be invalid pursuant to local law (see “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes”). As of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2017,
in the aggregate, approximately 6% and 7%, respectively, of our
consolidated revenues and 4% and 5%, respectively of our
consolidated assets relate to such foreign jurisdictions.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to create and perfect
liens on the Collateral that were not perfected on or prior to the issue
date of the initial secured notes within 120 days after the issue date of
the initial secured notes. We granted liens on substantially all
personal property collateral in the United States, Canada and France
on or prior to the Closing Date, subject to certain exceptions, and
perfected certain of such liens by UCC and PPSA filings for U.S. and
Canadian Note Guarantors on the Closing Date (subject to certain
exceptions). See “Description of the Notes—Security—Perfection
and Non-Perfection of Security Interests in Collateral” and “Annex
A— Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the
Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
Interests.”

For more information on the security granted, see “Description of the
Notes—Security.”

Intercreditor Agreement. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The collateral agents for the notes (the “Notes Collateral Agents”)
joined and became parties to that certain First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement (the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) dated as of
March 21, 2017, among Barclays Bank PLC (the “Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent”) and the other agents party thereto, setting forth
therein the relative rights with respect to the Shared Collateral (as
defined under “Description of the Notes”) and covering certain other
matters relating to the administration of security interests. Pursuant to
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent generally controls substantially all matters related to
the Shared Collateral, including with respect to decisions, or
enforcement, and may take actions that the holders of the notes may

disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of the holders of
the notes. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement also includes
waivers of certain important rights that holders of secured debt would
otherwise have. See “Description of the Notes—Security for the
Notes—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes and the guarantees are senior secured obligations of the
Company and the Note Guarantors. Accordingly, they are:

                        - general secured obligations, secured by a first-priority lien
(subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions) on the
Collateral;

                        - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future
unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company and the Note
Guarantors;

                       - senior in right of payment to all indebtedness of the Company
and the Note Guarantors that expressly provides for its
subordination to the notes;

                        - effectively pari passu with all existing and future indebtedness
secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral (including the
Credit Facilities and the Existing Secured Notes);

                         - effectively senior to all existing and future indebtedness that is
unsecured (including the Existing Senior Notes and the
guarantees thereof) or that is secured by junior liens, in each case
to the extent of the value of the Collateral; and

                         - structurally subordinated to (x) the liabilities of any of the
Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes to the
extent of the value of such subsidiaries’ assets and (y) any of the
Company’s debt that is secured by assets that are not Collateral
to the extent of the value of such assets.

As of September 30, 2017, after giving effect to the Recent
Developments Transactions and the Transactions, we and the Note
Guarantors would have had (i) $9.2 billion aggregate principal
amount of secured indebtedness outstanding, (ii) $16.9 billion
aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured indebtedness
outstanding and (iii) approximately $1.0 billion would have been
available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, after
adjusting for outstanding standby letters of credit. As of
September 30, 2017, we have no subordinated debt outstanding.

In addition, the notes and the guarantees are effectively junior in right
of payment to all liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of
September 30, 2017, on a non-consolidated basis, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries had an aggregate of $2.9 billion of assets and $1.3 billion
of liabilities.

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined herein), unless
the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the notes as
described above, holders of the notes may require the Company to
repurchase such holder’s notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such series plus
accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the purchase date
applicable to the notes.

Asset Sale Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If we or our restricted subsidiaries engage in certain asset sales, we
must either prepay certain debt, invest the net cash proceeds from
such sales in our business within a specified period of time or make
an offer to purchase a principal amount of notes equal to the excess
net cash proceeds of such asset sale, subject to certain exceptions. The
purchase price of the notes purchased will be 100% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
repurchase date, and shall be payable in cash, as described under the
heading “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales.”

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The indenture governing the notes contains covenants that, among
other things, limit the ability of the Company and our restricted
subsidiaries to:

                       - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

                       - make certain investments and other restricted payments;

                         - transfer and sell assets.

These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and
exceptions. At any time the notes are rated investment grade, certain
covenants will no longer be in effect for the remaining term of the
notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Changes
in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade.”

-----

Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the event that certain taxes are payable in respect of payments on
the notes or the guarantees, the Company or the applicable Note
Guarantor, as the case may be, will, subject to certain exceptions, pay
such additional amounts as will result, after deduction or withholding
of such taxes, in holders or beneficial owners of notes receiving the
amounts which such holder or beneficial owners of notes would have
received in respect of the notes and the guarantees, respectively, had
no such withholding or deduction been required. See “Description of
the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts.”

Optional Tax Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole

**RISK FACTORS**

In addition to the other information included in and incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum, including the matters addressed in the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements,” you should carefully consider the following risks and the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
periods ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum before purchasing the notes. You should also read and consider the other information in this
offering memorandum and the other documents incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. See
“Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference.”

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

See Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

**Risks Relating to the Notes**

**_Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Shared Collateral, the_**
**_representative of the lenders under the Credit Facilities will initially have the exclusive right to control_**
**_actions (including the exercise of remedies) with respect to the Shared Collateral. The First Lien_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions for a New York law intercreditor agreement, but_**
**_does not contain any provisions that seek to address European or other non-New York law insolvency and_**
**_restructuring considerations typically available in European or other non-New York law intercreditor_**
**_agreements._**

The rights of the holders of the notes in the Shared Collateral (including the right to exercise remedies) will
be subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the collateral
agents for the March 2022 Senior Secured Notes and the March 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Collateral
Agents and any representative for the holders of future pari passu obligations. Under the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to the Shared Collateral, including the ability to cause the
commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Shared Collateral or to control such proceedings, will be
at the direction of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier to occur of (x) the discharge of our
obligations under the Credit Facilities (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the Credit
Facilities) and (y) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the agreement governing the series
of first priority lien obligations representing the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by
a first-priority lien on the Shared Collateral (including the Credit Facilities) and the acceleration of such
indebtedness; provided the representative of such indebtedness has complied with the applicable notice
provisions and; provided further that such 180 day period will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed
not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral or (2) at any
time the grantor of the security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise
subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

At any time that the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent does not have the right to take action with respect to
the Shared Collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement as described above, then the authorized
representative for the series of notes or other debt that has the greatest outstanding principal amount would
exercise such right to take action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, none of the Notes Collateral Agents, the trustee for the notes
(the “Trustee”) or the holders of the notes may object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition or
commencement of any other insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding to (i) any debtor-in-possession
financing that is not opposed or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or (ii) the use of the Shared
Collateral to secure debtor-in-possession financing that meets certain specified conditions, subject to certain

20


-----

conditions and limited exceptions. After the filing of any bankruptcy petition or commencement of any other
insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding, the value of the Shared Collateral could materially
deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be prohibited from raising an objection thereto. For a description of
important waivers by holders of the notes and limits on their rights as secured creditors see “Description of the
Notes—Security for the Notes—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions for New York Law intercreditor
agreements governing priority of claims among secured creditors. See “Description of the Notes—Security for
the Notes—Intercreditor Agreement.” While a number of the Note Guarantors are incorporated, organized, or
have their center of main interest in jurisdictions other than New York, including, for example, the European
jurisdictions of Belgium, Belarus, England, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales, the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement does not contain provisions that typically would be included in these and other local jurisdictions. For
example, a typical European intercreditor agreement would address, on a contractual basis, certain European
insolvency and restructuring considerations which arise in the absence of consistent statutory provisions in
Europe equivalent to the framework under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “Bankruptcy
Code”), including, among others, provisions on standstill on the enforcement of liens on assets and on the
making of claims on direct debt obligations and guarantees, release or forced transfer of junior debt claims upon
the occurrence of “distressed disposals” during a restructuring or enforcement process and debt purchase options.

**_The lien of the Notes Collateral Agents in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security documents_**
**_entered into with the applicable Notes Collateral Agents and perfected in a manner that, under the laws_**
**_applicable to the creation and priority of liens in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, will give_**
**_it, in many cases, as a matter of law, third priority to the rights of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and_**
**_second priority to the rights of the collateral agents for the Existing Secured Notes. In such cases, holders of_**
**_the notes will have to rely on the Intercreditor Agreement to provide equal priority liens on such assets subject_**
**_to applicable law in such local jurisdictions, as the case may be. In addition, certain assets in certain foreign_**
**_jurisdictions are not capable of being pledged to more than one party at the same time and, as a result, in such_**
**_jurisdictions, such assets are pledged to the lenders under the Credit Agreement but will not be pledged for the_**
**_benefit of holders of the notes._**

In addition, the lien of the Notes Collateral Agents in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security
documents entered into with the applicable Notes Collateral Agents and perfected in a manner that, under the
laws applicable to the creation and priority of collateral in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged,
will give it, in most cases, as a matter of law, third priority to the rights of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
and second priority to the rights of the collateral agents for the Existing Secured Notes. As a result, the first
priority lien of the holders of the notes with respect to the Shared Collateral will be dependent on the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, which provides that the rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Shared
Collateral are secured on a first priority basis and to which the Credit Facility Collateral Agent and the collateral
agents for the Existing Secured Notes are a party. Such agreement may not be recognized in certain jurisdictions.

Certain of the collateral that has been pledged to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent (including tangible
assets in Germany, accounts receivable and assignments of rights under contracts in Germany and Poland,
accounts receivable and assets the subject of an assignment in the United Arab Emirates, and pledges of shares in
Italian and United Arab Emirates companies) will, pursuant to certain laws governing such collateral or local
practice applicable to such collateral, not be capable of being pledged and/or perfected (as applicable) at the same
time to the Notes Collateral Agents. The Credit Facility Collateral Agent holds a lien on such assets on behalf of
the lenders under the Credit Agreement, but will not be holding a lien on such assets or be acting as agent for the
benefit of the holders of the notes. In addition, there is a risk that, in Colombia, asset pledges subsequent to the
pledges in favor of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, including the pledges intended to secure the notes,
may be determined to be invalid pursuant to local law where the pledged asset is in the possession of the Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent (as is the case for the pledge of shares in the Issuer’s Colombian subsidiary). In each

21


-----

case, the lenders under the Credit Agreement will have a lien on such assets and the holders of the notes will not
have lien on such assets. See “Description of the Notes—Security for the Notes—General.” As of and for the
year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2017, in the aggregate, approximately
6% and 7%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues and 4% and 5%, respectively, of our consolidated assets
relate to such foreign jurisdictions.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral. The lien on Collateral will be released under certain_**
**_circumstances._**

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral securing the notes has been made in connection with this offering
and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others,
market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. By its nature, some or all of
the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the
fair market value of the Collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum exceeds the principal amount of
the debt secured thereby. The value of the Collateral and the guarantees could be impaired in the future as a
result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen
liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the
amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the
notes from the sale of the Collateral and the guarantees and the obligations under the notes will rank equally in
right of payment with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including
trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced by or against
us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes
and all other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the notes from and after the date such
proceedings are commenced or initiated. Also, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding outside of the ordinary course of our business would require approval from the bankruptcy
court (which may not be given under the circumstances).

To the extent that third parties enjoy prior liens on any of the Collateral, such third parties may have rights
and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral. In
addition, the existence of certain permitted liens will cause the relevant assets to become Excluded Assets (as
defined under “Description of the Notes”), which will not secure the notes or the guarantees. Additionally, the
terms of the indenture allow us to issue additional notes and additional debt that may rank pari passu with the
notes and incur refinancing indebtedness in certain circumstances. The indenture does not require that we
maintain the current level of collateral or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Under the
indenture, any such additional notes issued pursuant to the indenture and refinancing indebtedness or other
additional debt incurred in accordance with the terms of the indenture will rank pari passu with the notes and be
entitled to the same rights and priority with respect to the Collateral. Thus, the issuance of any such additional
debt and refinancing indebtedness may have the effect of significantly diluting your ability to recover payment in
full of the notes from the then existing pool of Collateral. Releases of Collateral from the liens securing the notes
will be permitted under certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes.”

In the future, the obligation to grant additional security over assets, or a particular type or class of assets,
whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of a previously
unrestricted subsidiary or otherwise, is subject to the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.
Furthermore, upon enforcement against any Collateral or during a bankruptcy insolvency proceeding, under the
terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the claims of the holders of the notes to the proceeds thereof will
rank equally with the claims of the holders of obligations under our Credit Facilities and Existing Secured Notes.
The security interest of the Notes Collateral Agents is subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Notes Collateral Agents may need to obtain the
consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. The Notes Collateral Agents may not
be able to obtain any such consent. Also, the consents of any third parties may not necessarily be given when
required to facilitate a foreclosure or realization on the Collateral. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agents may

22


-----

not have the ability to foreclose or realize upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease.

**_The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other_**
**_imperfections that may exist in respect of the security interests under the Credit Agreement._**

The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections that may exist in respect of the security interests under the Credit Agreement. In addition, foreign
security filings outside of the United States in respect of the security interests of the notes will only be made in
jurisdictions (and in the manner) where such security filings have been made under the Credit Agreement. The
existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections or lack of filings could
adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or
foreclose on the Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the notes. The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed
the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
imperfections, including the lack of any such filing in foreign jurisdictions outside of the United States, and the
existence thereof could adversely affect the value of the Collateral as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral
Agents to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the notes.

**_Enforcing your rights against the Company or under the guarantees of the notes by certain of our foreign_**
**_subsidiaries across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Company is a public corporation continued under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act and
certain of our existing subsidiaries that will guarantee and/or provide collateral for the notes are organized in
Australia, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, England and Wales, France,
Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. In the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of
organization of any future guarantor of the notes. Your rights under the notes and the guarantees and Collateral
Documents will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and you may not be able to effectively
enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial
uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

In addition, while the Issuer and the Note Guarantors will agree, in accordance with the terms of the
indenture governing the notes, to accept service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the
indenture governing the notes or the notes brought in any federal or state court located in New York City by an
agent designated for such purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits,
actions or proceedings, it may be difficult for holders of the notes to effect service within the U.S. upon directors,
officers and experts who are not residents of the U.S. in order to institute actions in U.S. courts predicated solely
upon civil liability under U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S. There may be doubt as to
the enforceability in non-U.S. jurisdictions in original actions, or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S.
courts, of civil liabilities predicated solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws or other laws of the U.S.
You should not assume that the non-U.S. jurisdictions: (a) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in
actions against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue
sky” laws of any state within the U.S.; or (b) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against such persons
predicated upon civil liabilities under the federal securities laws of the U.S. or “blue sky” laws of any state within
the U.S.

**_Rights of the holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens_**
**_on certain Collateral acquired in the future._**

Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security
interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at

23


-----

the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions, “blanket” or
“floating” liens will not be available to secure any Collateral. The Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agents will not
monitor, or we may not inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agents of, the future acquisitions of property
and rights that constitute Collateral, and necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security
interest in such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agents has any obligation
to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any
security interest in favor of the notes against third parties. As a result, the inability or failure of the Issuer or any
Note Guarantor to promptly take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests in the
Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection, of the security interest for the benefit
of the noteholders to which they would have been otherwise entitled. In addition, as described further herein,
even if the liens on Collateral acquired in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be
avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any
future pledge of collateral or guarantee provided after the notes are issued might be avoided by a trustee in
bankruptcy.”

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

Although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses, there are certain losses that may be either
uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, it is possible that the insurance
proceeds will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there is a total or partial
loss of any of the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient
to satisfy all the secured obligations, including the notes.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce_**
**_the pool of assets securing the notes and any future guarantees. In addition, certain assets, including_**
**_Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral._**

Subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the Credit Agreement, the security
documents allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest
and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For example, so long as no default or event of default under the
indenture would result therefrom, we may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee,
conduct activities with respect to Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of
Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). The lien on the Collateral will be
automatically released upon any permitted disposition thereof to a person that is not the Issuer or a Notes
Guarantor. See “Description of the Notes.”

In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral. See
“Description of the Notes—Security” for the definition of “Excluded Assets.”

**_Security interests in certain Collateral were not in place at the time of the offering of the initial secured_**
**_notes or were not perfected by such time. Such actions likewise will not have been taken by the closing of_**
**_this offering. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the issue date of the initial secured notes_**
**_and/or the closing date of this offering increases the risk that such security interests could be avoided._**

Certain security interests in favor of the Notes Collateral Agents, including, but not limited to, mortgages on
certain of our material real properties and liens on collateral not owned by Notes Guarantors organized in Canada
or the United States, were not in place and/or perfected as of the date on which the offering of the initial secured
notes closed and will not be in place and/or perfected as of the closing date of this offering. Filings with respect
to intellectual property Collateral in the United States are expected to be made on a post-closing basis. With
respect to any liens on or security interests in the Collateral that were not created or perfected on or prior to the
Issue Date, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests created or
perfected within 120 days of the issue date of the initial secured notes. Under U.S. bankruptcy law, to the extent a

24


-----

security interest in certain Collateral is granted or perfected after the date this offering closes, that security
interest would remain at risk of being avoided as a preferential transfer by the pledgor (as debtor in possession)
or by its trustee in bankruptcy if we were to file for bankruptcy within 90 days after the grant or after perfection
(or, under certain circumstances, up to one year). Other jurisdictions where we and the Note Guarantors will
pledge assets have similar and sometimes longer hardening periods.

Similarly, in Canada, there are a number of remedies under federal and provincial legislation available to a
trustee in bankruptcy, creditors of the debtor, a receiver, a monitor appointed in a Companies’ Creditors
Arrangement Act (Canada) proceeding, other court appointed officer and other interested parties to seek to set
aside or void a future pledge of collateral for existing indebtedness. See “—Each guarantee will be subject to
certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may
limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable U.S. and Canadian laws allow courts, under certain
circumstances, to void the notes or the guarantees and any related security or take other actions detrimental to the
holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors may not be available to make
payments in respect of the notes.”

In addition, mortgagee title insurance policies were not in place at the time of the issuance of the initial
secured notes and will not be in place as of the closing date of this offering to insure, among other things, (i) loss
resulting from the entity represented by us to be the fee owner thereof not holding valid fee title to the properties
or such fee being encumbered by unpermitted liens and (ii) the validity and lien priority of the mortgage granted
to the Notes Collateral Agents for their benefit, and for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes.
There was no independent assurance prior to issuance of the initial secured notes that all properties contemplated
to be mortgaged as security for the notes will be mortgaged, or that we hold the real property interests we
represent we hold or that we may mortgage such interests, or that there will be no lien encumbering such real
property interests other than those permitted by the indenture governing the notes. Moreover, land surveys were
not be completed at the time of the issuance of the initial secured notes. As a result, there is no independent
assurance that, among other things, no encroachments, adverse possession claims, zoning or other restricts exist
with respect to the properties intended to be mortgaged which could result in a material adverse effect on the
value or utility of such properties. The title insurance process and surveys could reveal certain issues that we will
not be able to resolve. If we are unable to resolve any issues raised by the surveys or that are otherwise raised in
connection with obtaining the mortgages or title insurance policies, the mortgages and title insurance policies
will be subject to such issues. Such issues could have a significant impact on the value of the Collateral or any
recovery under the title insurance policies. If we are unable to obtain any mortgage or title insurance policy on
any of the real property intended to constitute collateral for the notes and guarantees, the value of the Collateral
securing the notes and the guarantees will be significantly reduced. In addition, the properties intended to be
mortgaged may be subject to both known and unknown environmental risks, and these risks may reduce or
change the value of such properties.

**_Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee provided after the notes are issued might be avoided by a_**
**_trustee in bankruptcy._**

The indenture governing the notes and the Collateral Documents require us to cause any subsidiary that
guarantees the Credit Agreement or Existing Notes of the Issuer to provide a guarantee of the notes and require
us to and to cause such subsidiary guarantors to grant liens on certain assets that we or any such subsidiary
guarantor holds at the time the notes are issued or acquires after the notes are issued. Any future guarantee or
additional lien in favor of the Notes Collateral Agents for the benefit of the holders of the notes might be
avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain
events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien
was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before that entity commenced a
bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that
benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future
guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were

25


-----

liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential
transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were
delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of
lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as
a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date (or recorded
within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if we or any Note Guarantor
were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the outstanding notes or the issue date with respect to
the notes being offered hereby and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before the commencement of
such bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a result of
having been delivered after the issue date. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, the holders of the notes
would lose the benefit of the security that the Collateral was intended to provide.

**_You may have difficulty enforcing U.S. and Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws._**

Under the Bankruptcy Code, U.S. bankruptcy courts are given jurisdiction over a debtor’s property
wherever it is located, including property situated in other countries. However, courts outside of the U.S. may not
recognize the U.S. bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty administering a U.S.
bankruptcy case or a ruling of a U.S. bankruptcy court involving the Issuer, because its center of main interest
and/or the substantial majority of its respective property are located outside of the U.S. Any orders or judgments
of a bankruptcy court in the U.S. may not be enforceable against the Issuer with respect to its property located
outside the U.S.

Similarly, under Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws, courts have jurisdiction over a debtor’s property
wherever it is located, including property situated in other countries. However, courts outside of Canada may not
recognize the Canadian court’s jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty administering a Canadian
bankruptcy or insolvency case involving the Issuer, because its center of main interest and/or the substantial
majority of their respective property is located outside of Canada. Any orders or judgments of a Canadian court
may not be enforceable against the Issuer with respect to its property located outside Canada. Similar difficulties
may arise in administering bankruptcy cases in other jurisdictions.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all existing liens on the Collateral._**

We conducted lien searches on the Collateral in the United States and Canada (but not all other applicable
jurisdictions) solely in connection with the issuance of the initial secured notes (and will not be re-running or
updating such searches), and we cannot guarantee that these lien searches revealed (or would have revealed) all
existing liens on the Collateral. Any existing undiscovered lien could be significant, could be prior in ranking to
the liens securing the notes or the guarantees and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Notes
Collateral Agents to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral. In addition, certain statutory priority liens may also
exist that cannot be discovered by lien searches.

**_Each guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws_**
**_or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability. Applicable U.S. and Canadian_**
**_laws allow courts, under certain circumstances, to void the notes or the guarantees and any related security_**
**_or take other actions detrimental to the holders of the notes such that the resources of the Issuer and the_**
**_Note Guarantors may not be available to make payments in respect of the notes._**

Each Note Guarantor guarantees the payment of the notes on a first lien, senior secured basis and provides
the holders of the notes, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agents with a direct claim against each relevant
Note Guarantor. However, the indenture provides that each guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed by the relevant Note Guarantor without rendering the relevant guarantee, as it relates to
that Note Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each
guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. The indenture also permits guarantees by

26


-----

foreign subsidiaries to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these
limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. For example, our subsidiaries in France can only guarantee the
notes up to an amount equal to the amount of proceeds actually contributed to the French subsidiaries.

Enforcement of any of the guarantees against any Note Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses
available to Note Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that
relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, transfer at undervalue, avoidable
preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. The Issuer or its creditors or the creditors of one or more Note Guarantors could challenge the
issuances of any of the notes or the guarantees and any related security as fraudulent transfers, conveyances or
preferences, transfers at under value or on other grounds under applicable Canadian federal or provincial law or
applicable U.S. federal or state law or other applicable law. If one or more of these laws and defenses are
applicable, a Note Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its guarantee depending on the
amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in
New York courts in such jurisdictions could also limit the enforceability of any guarantee against any Note
Guarantor.

A court could avoid the obligations under the notes or any guarantee and any related security or take other
actions detrimental to the holders of the notes if, among other things, it were to determine that the Issuer or the
applicable Note Guarantor:

   - issued the notes or guarantee or any related security with the intent to prefer or defeat, hinder, delay or
defraud its existing or future creditors;

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing the notes or the
guarantee or any related security; and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the
notes or the guarantee; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant
guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to
pay at maturity; or

   - under Canadian law only and with respect only to the Issuer and Note Guarantors that are Canadian
companies, acted in an oppressive manner, unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly disregarded the interests of
any stakeholder or other interested party.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to
the indenture, which are also subject to the risk of being avoided as a preference to the extent they are issued
after the date this offering closes.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a Note
Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or any related
security to the extent such Note Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit from the issuance of the
notes.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law being
applied in any particular proceeding, such that we cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in
determining whether a Note Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of method of
valuation, a court would not determine that a Note Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or a that a court would
not determine, regardless of whether or not a Note Guarantor was insolvent on the date its guarantee was issued,
that payments to holders of the notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other
grounds under United States law. Generally, a Note Guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets;

27


-----

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

The liability of each Note Guarantor under its guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such
guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise
being set aside (although this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees from being avoided under
fraudulent transfer laws). However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each Note Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee
may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

Under U.S. and Canadian law, to the extent a court avoids a guarantee and any related security as a
fraudulent transfer, preference or conveyance or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the notes
would cease to have any direct claim against the Note Guarantor that delivered the guarantee and would be
creditors solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Note Guarantor under the relevant guarantee which
has not been avoided. In the event that any guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the notes
would be, to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the
applicable Note Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the notes or any guarantee is found to
be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can
ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the notes. Similar limitations could apply in other jurisdictions.
With respect to such other jurisdictions, there may be certain local limitations on perfection of collateral or
enforcement against security interests which could affect your ability to realize the full or intended benefits of the
security interests over the Collateral, which limitations may be material. See “Annex A—Certain Insolvency
Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”
for a discussion of certain limitations applicable to certain foreign subsidiaries.

**_The security interests over the Collateral will be granted to the Notes Collateral Agents rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the notes. The ability of the Notes Collateral Agents to enforce the Collateral may be_**
**_restricted by local law._**

In certain jurisdictions, the security over the Collateral that (if and when granted) will constitute security for
the obligations under the notes and the indenture will not be granted directly to the holders of the notes but only
in favor of the Notes Collateral Agents, as beneficiaries of parallel debt or analogous obligations, or “parallel
debt.” This parallel debt is created to satisfy a requirement under the applicable laws that the Notes Collateral
Agents, as grantees of certain types of collateral, be treated as if they were creditors of the relevant security
provider. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations under the
indenture and the notes, or the “principal obligations.” Any payment in respect of the principal obligations shall
discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt shall discharge the
corresponding principal obligations. Although the Notes Collateral Agents will have, pursuant to the parallel
debt, a claim for the full principal amount of the notes, holders of the notes bear some risks associated with a
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Notes Collateral Agents. The parallel debt obligations referred to above
are contained in the indenture, which is governed by New York law. There is no assurance that such a structure
will be effective before applicable courts as there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore
the ability of the Notes Collateral Agents to enforce the Collateral may be restricted.

**_Rights of the holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and insolvency_**
**_proceedings and the holders of the notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses in_**
**_any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agents to repossess and dispose of the Collateral is likely to be
significantly impaired, and at a minimum delayed if U.S. bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against

28


-----

us prior to or possibly even after the Notes Collateral Agents have repossessed and disposed of the Collateral.
Under the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon a bankruptcy filing, secured creditors,
such as the Notes Collateral Agents, are prohibited from repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy
case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which
may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, U.S. bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to
retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of collateral, even though the debtor is in
default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection”.
The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general
to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in collateral and may include cash payments or the granting
of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any
diminution in the value of collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of collateral
by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured
creditor does not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of such collateral
exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the
broad discretionary powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments
under the notes could be delayed following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in
making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agents would repossess or dispose of the
Collateral, or whether or to what extent the holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment
or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.”

Furthermore, in the event a U.S. bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient
to repay all amounts due on the notes and any additional obligations secured by first priority liens, the holders of
the notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference. U.S. bankruptcy laws do not permit the
payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees for “undersecured claims” during
the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among
other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws with respect to
the unsecured portion of the notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the
time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by a U.S. bankruptcy
court as a reduction of the principal amount of the notes.

In addition, as set forth above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will impose limitations on the ability
of the holders of the notes to object to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing unless the controlling collateral
agent opposes or objects thereto.

Similarly, in Canada, the right of the Notes Collateral Agents to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon
acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency law if such
proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the Notes Collateral Agents have
repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Pursuant to the stay imposed in certain Canadian bankruptcy and
insolvency proceedings, secured creditors, such as the Notes Collateral Agents, are prohibited from repossessing
their security from a debtor, or from disposing of security from a debtor, without court approval. Moreover,
certain Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings permit the debtor (or its trustee, receiver or similar
representative) to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of collateral,
even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, so long as the secured creditor is not
unduly prejudiced having regard to the interest of the stakeholders generally. Moreover, in such proceedings, the
court may, subject to certain conditions, create court-ordered charges on the assets of the debtor to secure interim
financing, professional fees, post-filing amounts owing to critical suppliers, statutory director liabilities or other
amounts, in priority to the liens that secure the notes.

What constitutes undue prejudice may vary according to the circumstances, but the concept is intended in
general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral. In some cases, the court will grant
orders to avoid undue prejudice to a secured creditor that may include cash payments, the granting of
replacement liens or replacement or additional collateral as security for any diminution in the value of the

29


-----

collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or the disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during
the pendency of the bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. One of the factors that a court is required to consider
before granting such court-ordered charges is whether any creditor would be materially prejudiced by the
granting of such a charge; however, this is only one of the factors that the court will assess in such circumstances
and there is no express concept of “adequate protection” under Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws.
Moreover, certain provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement may limit the collateral agent’s voting
rights on a proposal or plan of arrangement and may limit the collateral agent’s ability to seek other protection
for the holders of the notes. See “Description of the Notes.”

Any such restructuring plan or proposal, if accepted by the requisite majorities of creditors and if approved
by the relevant Canadian court, would likely result in the compromise or extinguishment of the rights of the
holders of the notes and the indenture and may result in the relevant debtor retaining possession and
administration of its property notwithstanding that an event of default occurred under the notes. The powers of
the court under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and particularly under the Companies’ Creditors
Arrangement Act (Canada) have been exercised broadly to protect a restructuring entity from actions taken by
creditors and other parties. Accordingly, in the event that the benefit of such legislation is sought with respect to
us or the guarantors, we cannot predict if payments under the notes would be made following commencement of
or during any such proceeding, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agents could exercise their rights under the
indenture and the applicable Collateral Documents, whether claims of holders could be compromised or
extinguished under such a proceeding or whether and to what extent holders would be compensated for any
delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the Notes
Collateral Agents.

A restructuring proposal, if accepted by the requisite majorities of each affected class of creditors, and if
approved by the relevant Canadian court, would be binding on all creditors within each affected class, including
those creditors that did not vote to accept the proposal. Moreover, this legislation, in certain instances, permits
the insolvent debtor to retain possession and administration of its property, subject to court oversight, even
though it may be in default under the applicable debt instrument, during the period that the stay against
proceedings remains in place. In addition, it may be possible to restructure certain debt obligations, including
guarantees, under the applicable corporate governing statute.

The powers of the court under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada), and particularly under the
Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada), have been interpreted and exercised broadly so as to protect a
restructuring entity from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether
payments under the notes or the guarantees thereof would be made during any proceedings in bankruptcy,
insolvency or other restructuring, whether or when the Trustee could exercise its rights under the indenture
governing the notes or whether and to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delays in
payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the Trustee.

**_We have incurred significant indebtedness, including the notes offered hereby, which restricts the manner_**
**_in which we conduct business._**

As of September 30, 2017, after giving effect to the Recent Developments Transactions and the
Transactions, we and the Note Guarantors would have had (i) $9.2 billion aggregate principal amount of secured
indebtedness outstanding, (ii) $16.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured indebtedness
outstanding and (iii) approximately $1.0 billion would have been available for borrowing under the Revolving
Credit Facility, after adjusting for outstanding standby letters of credit. As of September 30, 2017, we have no
subordinated indebtedness outstanding. We may incur additional long-term debt and working capital lines of
credit to meet future financing needs, subject to certain restrictions and prohibitions under the agreements
governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the notes, which would increase our total debt.
This additional debt may be substantial and some of this indebtedness may be secured.

30


-----

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants which impose certain limitations
on the way we conduct our business, including limitations on the amount of additional debt we are able to incur,
prohibitions on incurring additional debt if certain financial covenants are not met and restrictions on our ability
to make certain investments and other restricted payments. Any additional debt, to the extent we are able to incur
it, may further restrict the manner in which we conduct business. Such restrictions, prohibitions and limitations
could impact our ability to implement elements of our strategy in the following ways:

   - our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable terms or at all could be limited;

   - there may be instances in which we are unable to meet the financial covenants contained in our debt
agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required payments on our debt, which circumstances
may result in the acceleration of the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness (which we
may not have the ability to pay);

   - there may be instances in which we are unable to meet the financial covenants contained in our debt
agreements, at which time we may be prohibited from incurring any additional debt until such covenants
are met;

   - in 2017 and possibly beyond, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be allocated
(and, in future years, may be allocated) to service our debt, thus reducing the amount of our cash flow
available for other purposes, including operating costs and capital expenditures that could improve our
competitive position and results of operations;

   - we may issue debt or equity securities or sell some of our assets (subject to certain restrictions under our
existing indebtedness) to meet payment obligations or to reduce our financial leverage, and we cannot
assure you whether such transactions will be on favorable terms;

   - our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the pharmaceutical and
medical device industries may be compromised;

   - we may be put at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that do not have as much debt as we
have, and competitors that may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources;
and

   - as further described below, our ability to make acquisitions and execute business development activities
through acquisitions will be limited and may, in future years, continue to be limited.

In addition, the Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on us until the time that our leverage
ratio (being the ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) as of such day to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the four
fiscal quarter period ending on such date) is less than 4.50 to 1.00, including (i) imposing a $500 million per
annum aggregate cap (the “Transaction Cap”) on acquisitions, subject to a 50% one year carry-over for unused
amounts and certain other exceptions and applicable baskets, (ii) restricting the incurrence of debt to finance such
acquisitions and (iii) requiring the net proceeds from certain asset sales be used to repay the term loans instead of
being reinvested in the business. In addition, our ability to make certain other investments, dividends,
distributions, share repurchases and other restricted payments will also be restricted and subject to the further
limitations until our leverage ratio is less than 4.00 to 1.00.

**_The notes will mature after a substantial portion of our other indebtedness._**

The notes will mature on November 1, 2025. A substantial portion of our existing indebtedness (including
under the Credit Agreement and many of our Existing Notes) will mature prior to those dates. Therefore, we will
be required to repay a substantial portion of our other debt before we are required to repay the notes. As a result,
we may not have sufficient cash to repay all amounts owing on the notes. There can be no assurance that we will
have the ability to borrow or otherwise raise the amounts necessary to repay or refinance such amounts.

31


-----

**_To service our debt, we will be required to generate a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate_**
**_cash depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and any failure to meet our_**
**_debt service obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash_**
**_flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of the notes to decline._**

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend
principally upon our future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial,
business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, may affect our ability to make payments on
our debt. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to
undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or
delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt
will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be
at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict
our business operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to
refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of the notes to decline.

Repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their
ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be
able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual
restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. Certain non-guarantor subsidiaries include
non-U.S. subsidiaries that may be prohibited by law or other regulations from distributing funds to us and/or we
may be subject to payment of taxes and withholdings on such distributions. In the event that we do not receive
distributions from our subsidiaries or receive cash via services rendered and intellectual property licensed, we
may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.

We have publicly indicated that it is our intention during 2017 to focus on reducing our outstanding debt
levels. As described above, our ability to reduce our indebtedness will depend upon factors including our future
operating performance and prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which
are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance of the amount by which we will reduce our debt, if at all.

**_The Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our Existing Notes, impose restrictive and financial_**
**_covenants on us. Our failure to comply with these covenants could trigger events, which could result in the_**
**_acceleration of the related debt, a cross-default or cross-acceleration to other debt, foreclosure upon any_**
**_collateral securing the debt and termination of any commitments to lend, each of which would have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and would_**
**_cause the market value of the notes to decline and could lead to bankruptcy or liquidation._**

The Credit Agreement and the various indentures governing our Existing Notes contain covenants that
restrict the way we conduct business for example, requiring us to satisfy certain financial tests in connection with
the incurrence of certain debt.

The Revolving Credit Facility under the Company’s Credit Agreement contains specified quarterly financial
maintenance covenants (consisting of a secured leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio). As of
September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial maintenance covenants related to our outstanding
debt. However, we can make no assurance that we will be able to comply with the restrictive and financial
covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and indentures in the future. We continue to take steps to reduce
our debt levels and improve profitability to ensure continual compliance with the financial maintenance
covenants.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company completed several actions which included
using the proceeds from divestitures and cash flows from operations to repay debt, amending financial

32


-----

maintenance covenants, extending a significant portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, and refinancing certain
debt with near term maturities. These actions reduced the Company’s debt balance and positively affected the
Company’s ability to comply with its financial maintenance covenants. The Company, based on its current
forecast for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2017 and the amendments executed, expects to remain in compliance with these financial
maintenance covenants and meet its debt service obligations over that same period. If we perform below our
forecasted levels, we will implement certain cost-efficiency initiatives, such as rationalization of selling, general
and administrative expenses and research and development spend, which would allow us to continue to comply
with the financial maintenance covenants. If we perform below our forecasted levels and the actions referenced
above are not effective in reducing our secured debt levels or increasing adjusted EBITDA, we would fail to
comply with one or both of these financial maintenance covenants. In that instance, we would be in default, and
our lenders would be permitted to accelerate our debt unless we could obtain an amendment or waiver. If our
debt was accelerated, we would not have sufficient funds to repay our debt absent a refinancing, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain a refinancing. The Company continues to take steps to improve its
operating results to ensure continual compliance with its financial maintenance covenants and take other actions
to reduce its debt levels to align with the Company’s long term strategy. The Company may consider taking other
actions, including divesting other businesses and refinancing debt as deemed appropriate, to provide additional
coverage in complying with the financial maintenance covenants and meeting its debt service obligations.

In the past, we have had a number of defaults under our Credit Agreement and indentures due to delays in
the filing of Exchange Act reports, the related financial statements and other required securities reporting
obligations. While we have been able to obtain waivers and amendments, the terms of such waivers and
amendments have added additional restrictions on our activities. For instance, the Credit Agreement imposes a
number of restrictions on us until the time that our leverage ratio (being the ratio, as of the last day of any fiscal
quarter, of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of such day to Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the four fiscal quarter period ending on such date) is
less than 4.50 to 1.00, including (i) the Transaction Cap, (ii) restricting the incurrence of debt to finance such
acquisitions and (iii) requiring the net proceeds from certain asset sales be used to repay the term loans instead of
being reinvested in the business. In addition, our ability to make certain other investments, dividends,
distributions, share repurchases and other restricted payments will also be restricted and subject to certain
limitations until our leverage ratio is less than 4.00 to 1.00.

Our inability to comply with the covenants in our debt instruments could lead to a default or an event of
default under the terms of the Credit Agreement or the applicable indentures, for which we may need to seek
relief from our lenders and noteholders in order to waive the associated default or event of default and avoid a
potential acceleration of the related indebtedness or cross-default or cross-acceleration to other debt. There can
be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such relief on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise and
we may be required to incur significant additional costs. In addition, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and
holders of our Existing Notes may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us as a condition to
granting any such waiver.

If an event of default is not cured or is not otherwise waived, a majority of lenders in principal amount
under the Credit Agreement or the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of a series of our
Existing Notes or the notes offered hereby may accelerate the maturity of the related debt under these
agreements, foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt and terminate any commitments to lend, any of
which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations and would cause the market value of our securities, including the notes, to decline. Furthermore, under
these circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations and we
may be unable to obtain alternative financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. In such circumstances, we could
be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation and, as a result, investors could lose all or a portion of their investment
in the notes.

**_The assets of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors will be subject to prior claims by creditors of those_**
**_subsidiaries._**

You will not have a claim as a creditor against our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes. Not all
of our subsidiaries will guarantee the notes and our subsidiaries that do guarantee the notes may obtain releases
of their guarantees as set forth in the indenture. See “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.” Therefore, the
assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will be subject to prior claims by creditors of those subsidiaries, whether
secured or unsecured. In addition, unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture will not be subject to the
covenants in the indenture. Except for the Note Guarantors, our subsidiaries will have no obligation, contingent
or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether
by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment. The notes will therefore be structurally subordinated to all
indebtedness and other obligations of any non-guarantor subsidiary such that, in the event of insolvency,
liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any such subsidiary, all of such subsidiary’s
creditors (including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any) would be entitled to payment in full out of
such subsidiary’s assets before the holders of the notes would be entitled to any payment. The indenture will
permit non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt, subject to specified limits, and will not limit their
ability to incur liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. As of September 30, 2017, on a non-consolidated
basis, our non-guarantor subsidiaries had an aggregate of $2.9 billion of assets and $1.3 billion of liabilities.

**_We may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt._**

Subject to the restrictions in the indenture governing the notes and our other outstanding indebtedness,
including the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes, we may incur significant additional debt, including
secured debt that could share in the Collateral that secures the notes. As of September 30, 2017, after giving
effect to the Recent Developments Transactions and the Transactions, we and the Note Guarantors would have
had (i) $9.2 billion aggregate principal amount of secured indebtedness outstanding, (ii) $16.9 billion aggregate
principal amount of senior unsecured indebtedness outstanding and (iii) approximately $1.0 billion would have
been available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, after adjusting for outstanding standby letters
of credit. As of September 30, 2017, we have no subordinated debt outstanding. Although the terms of the Credit
Agreement, the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the indenture governing the notes contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, including secured debt, these restrictions are subject to a number
of important exceptions, including our ability under certain circumstances to enter into new senior secured credit
facilities that are secured by all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets, and debt incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. If we and our restricted subsidiaries incur significant additional debt, the related
risks that we face could intensify.

**_Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws may impair the Trustee’s ability to enforce remedies against the_**
**_Company or under the guarantee of any Note Guarantor organized under Canadian law._**

The rights of the Trustee who represents the holders of the notes to enforce remedies could be delayed by
the restructuring provisions of applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring
legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought with respect to the Company or any Note Guarantor
organized under Canadian law. For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and the
Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) contain provisions enabling an insolvent person to obtain a
stay of proceedings against its creditors and to file a proposal to be voted on by the various classes of its affected
creditors. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the notes or the guarantees thereof would be
made during any proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring, whether or when the Trustee
could exercise its rights under the indenture governing the notes or whether and to what extent holders of the
notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees
and disbursements of the Trustee.

-----

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes if it experiences a change of control._**

The indenture governing the notes will require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the notes when certain
change of control events occur. If a change of control of the Company occurs, you will have the right to require
the Issuer to repurchase some or all of your notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount of your notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In
addition, the indentures governing the Existing Notes contain change of control provisions which give the
holders of the notes the right to require the applicable issuer thereunder to repurchase the notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the applicable notes to be repurchased plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date, and a change of control may constitute a default under the
Credit Agreement.

In the event that we experience a change of control that results in having to repurchase the notes, we may
not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy our obligations under the notes, our Existing Notes and our other
indebtedness. In addition, the change of control covenant in the indenture governing the notes offered hereby will
not cover all corporate reorganizations, mergers or similar transactions and may not provide you with protection
in a highly leveraged transaction. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change
of Control.”

**_The ability of holders of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase notes as a result of a disposition of_**
**_“substantially all” of the Company’s assets may be uncertain._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture governing the notes will include a phrase relating to the
direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets or
properties of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase such notes as a
result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets or properties of the
Company and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain.

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights and we do not currently intend to register the_**
**_notes under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the_**
**_notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws and Canadian provincial securities laws and we do not currently intend to
register the notes or to offer to exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act. The holders of
the notes will not be entitled to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may
transfer or resell the notes in the U.S. or Canada only in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and Canadian provincial
securities laws or Canadian prospectus requirements, as applicable, and you may be required to bear the risk of
your investment for an indefinite period of time. Additionally, the indenture that will govern the notes will not be
subject to the provisions of the TIA. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_There is no established trading market for the notes. If an actual trading market does not develop for the_**
**_notes, you may not be able to resell them quickly, for the price that you paid or at all._**

The notes will constitute a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to
apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for any quotation on any automated
dealer quotation systems. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes,
but they are not obligated to do so. Each Initial Purchaser may discontinue any market making in the notes at any
time, in its sole discretion, without prior notice. As a result, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any
trading market for the notes.

35


-----

We also cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or at all, or that the
prices that you receive when you sell them will be favorable. If no active trading market develops, you may not
be able to resell your notes at their fair market value, or at all. The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes
may also be adversely affected by, among other things:

   - prevailing interest rates;

   - our operating performance and financial condition;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market; and

   - the market for similar securities.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
volatility in prices of securities similar to the notes. It is possible that the market for the notes will be subject to
disruptions. Any disruptions may have a negative effect on noteholders, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance.

**_Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the notes._**

Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due.
Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the value of the notes. These
credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to structure or marketing of the notes. Agency
ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time
by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.
There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such
ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency’s
judgment, circumstances so warrant. Since late 2015, our corporate credit ratings have been lowered or revised
on multiple occasions by both Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“Standard &
Poor’s”). Any further downgrade in our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of
borrowing and may negatively impact our ability to raise additional debt capital.

Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our
ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the value of the notes, may increase our borrowing
costs and may negatively impact our ability to incur additional debt.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture would not apply from and after such time that the notes are rated_**
**_investment grade by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, even if the notes are subsequently rated below_**
**_investment grade._**

Many of the covenants contained in the indenture relating to the notes will not apply from and after such
time that the notes are rated investment grade by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, and such covenants will not be
reinstated if the notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade. These covenants restrict, among
other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness or issue preferred stock, to pay distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock or redeem or
repurchase certain debt, sell assets, enter into certain merger transactions, enter into transactions with affiliates,
enter into agreements limiting the ability of subsidiaries to make distributions and enter into certain other
transactions. There can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that the notes will
maintain such ratings. However, termination of these covenants will allow us to engage in certain actions that
would not have been permitted were these covenants in force, even if the notes are subsequently downgraded
below investment grade.

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required if this offering were being registered_**
**_with the SEC or qualified under applicable Canadian Securities Laws (as defined herein)._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were
registering this offering of the notes with the SEC or qualifying it under applicable Canadian Securities Laws.
Among other things, we have not included any financial statements of our affiliates whose securities constitute
collateral for the notes, even though the book value or fair market value of such affiliates’ securities may exceed
20% of the principal amount of the notes or footnotes in our financial statements that show condensed
consolidating financial information for us and the guarantors of the notes. See “Presentation of Financial
Information—Financial Information with Respect to Note Guarantors and Stock Pledges.” This lack of
information could affect your ability to evaluate your investment in the notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering, after giving effect to the Initial Purchasers’
discount and fees and expenses payable by us, of approximately $ million.

We intend to use the net proceeds, along with cash on hand, from this offering to repay (on a pro rata basis)
a portion of our Series F Tranche B Term Loan Facility due 2022, and to pay related fees and expenses.
Subsequent to the consummation of this offering and the use of proceeds thereof, we intend to effectuate a
repricing transaction with respect to our then remaining Series F Tranche B Term Loans. See “Summary—

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Credit Facilities**

The following description is a summary and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its
entirety by, the Credit Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to our filings with the SEC.

On February 13, 2012, we and certain of our subsidiaries as guarantors entered into the Third Amended and
Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended through the date hereof, the “Credit Agreement” and the
facilities under such agreement, the “Credit Facilities”) with a syndicate of financial institutions and investors, as
lenders. The Credit Agreement currently provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, including a sublimit
for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit and a sublimit for swing line loans (the “Revolving
Credit Facility”) and a senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”), which matures on
April 1, 2022.

On March 21, 2017, the Company entered into Amendment No. 14 to the Credit Agreement (“Amendment
No. 14”) which (i) provided additional financing from an incremental term loan under the Company’s Series F
Tranche B Term Loan Facility of $3,060 million (the “Series F-3 Tranche B Term Loan”), which was used, in
conjunction with the proceeds from the offering of the Existing Secured Notes and balance sheet cash, to pay
down certain amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities and the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2018, (ii) amended
the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, (iii) increased the amortization rate for the Series F
Tranche B Term Loan Facility from 0.25% per quarter (1% per annum) to 1.25% per quarter (5% per annum),
with quarterly payments starting March 31, 2017, (iv) amended certain financial definitions, including the
definition of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, and (v) provided additional ability for the Company to, among
other things, incur indebtedness and liens, consummate acquisitions and make other investments. The proceeds
from the Series F-3 Tranche B Term Loan, combined with the proceeds from the issuance of the Existing
Secured Notes and cash on hand, were used to (i) repay all outstanding balances under the Company’s Series A-3
Tranche A Term Loan Facility, Series A-4 Tranche A Term Loan Facility, Series D-2 Tranche B Term Loan
Facility, Series C-2 Tranche B Term Loan Facility, and Series E-1 Tranche B Term Loan Facility (collectively
the “Refinanced Debt”), (ii) repurchase $1,100 million in principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due August
2018, (iii) repay $350 million of amounts outstanding under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and
(iv) pay related fees and expenses (collectively, the “March 2017 Refinancing Transactions”).

On March 28, 2017, the Company entered into Amendment No. 15 to the Credit Agreement (“Amendment
No. 15”) which provided for the extension of the maturity date of $1,190 million of revolving credit
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from April 20, 2018 to the earlier of (i) April 20, 2020 and
(ii) the date that is 91 calendar days prior to the scheduled maturity of any series or tranche of term loans under
the Credit Agreement, certain Existing Notes and any other indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of
$750 million. Unless otherwise terminated prior thereto, the remaining $310 million of revolving credit
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility will continue to terminate (and loans thereunder mature) on
April 20, 2018.

Set forth below is a summary of the Credit Facilities, and this description is subject to the terms and
provisions of the various agreements governing the Credit Facilities.

The loans under the Credit Facilities may be made to, and the letters of credit under the Revolving Credit
Facility may be issued on behalf of, the Company. Subject to customary limitations, borrowings under the Credit
Facilities are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default or an event of
default and the accuracy in all material respects of representations and warranties.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option,
either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the rate of interest quoted in the print edition of

41


-----

The Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section, as the Prime Rate (currently defined as the base rate on corporate
loans posted by at least 75% of the nation’s thirty largest banks) and (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2
of 1% or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest
period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, in each case plus an applicable margin.

The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are 2.75% with
respect to base rate borrowings and 3.75% with respect to LIBO rate borrowings. These applicable margins are
subject to increase or decrease quarterly based on the secured leverage ratio. Based on its calculation of the
Company’s secured leverage ratio, management does not anticipate any such increase or decrease to the current
applicable margins for the next applicable period. In addition, we are required to pay commitment fees of 0.50%
per annum in respect of the unutilized commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in
arrears. We are also required to pay letter of credit fees on the maximum amount available to be drawn under all
outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the applicable margin on LIBO rate borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility on a per annum basis, payable quarterly in arrears, as well as customary fronting fees
for the issuance of letters of credit and agency fees.

Borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either
(a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the rate of interest quoted in the print edition of The
Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section, as the Prime Rate (currently defined as the base rate on corporate
loans posted by at least 75% of the nation’s thirty largest banks) and (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2
of 1% (provided however, that the base rate in respect of loans under the Term Loan B Facility shall at no time
be less than 1.75% per annum) or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar
deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs (provided
however, that the LIBO rate in respect of loans under the Term Loan B Facility shall at no time be less than
0.75%), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable interest rate margins for the Series F Tranche B
Term Loan Facility are 3.75% with respect to base rate borrowings and 4.75% with respect to LIBO rate
borrowings. These applicable margins are subject to increase or decrease quarterly based on the secured leverage
ratio beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Based on its calculation of the Company’s secured leverage
ratio, management does not anticipate any such increase or decrease to the current applicable margins for the
next applicable period. The Company is seeking to reduce the applicable margin for its term loans that will
remain outstanding following the consummation of the offering (and the application of proceeds thereof) through
the Credit Agreement Amendment.

Subject to certain exceptions and customary baskets set forth in the Credit Agreement, we are required to
make mandatory prepayments of the loans under the Credit Facilities under certain circumstances, including
from (1) 100% of net cash proceeds from asset sales outside the ordinary course of business (subject to
reinvestment rights once we achieve a leverage ratio of less than 4.50:1.00), (2) 100% of the net cash proceeds of
insurance and condemnation proceeds for property or asset losses (subject to reinvestment rights and net
proceeds threshold), (3) 50% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities (subject to certain
exceptions) subject to decrease based on leverage ratios, (4) 100% of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence
of debt (other than permitted debt as specified in the Credit Agreement) and (5) 50% of Consolidated Excess
Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement, and net of certain amounts) subject to decrease based on
leverage ratios.

We are permitted to voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the revolving commitment amount and
repay outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than
customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBO rate loans. We are permitted to voluntarily repay outstanding
loans under any of the other Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than (i) customary
“breakage” costs with respect to LIBO rate loans and (ii) in the case of any prepayment of the Series F Tranche B
Term Loans on or prior to March 21, 2019 in connection with a Repricing Transaction (as such term is defined in

42


-----

the Credit Agreement), a prepayment premium of 1% of the amount of the Series F Tranche B Term Loans being
prepaid (which prepayment premium also applies in the case of a repricing amendment). The Company is
seeking to reduce the period for which such prepayment premium will apply through the Credit Agreement
Amendment.

Our obligations and the obligations of the guarantors under the Credit Facilities and certain hedging
arrangements and cash management arrangements entered into with lenders under the Credit Facilities (or
affiliates thereof) are secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral subject to certain exclusions set
forth in the credit documentation governing the Credit Facilities.

The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to certain
exceptions, restrict our ability and our subsidiaries to:

   - incur additional indebtedness;

   - create liens;

   - enter into agreements and other arrangements that include negative pledge clauses;

   - pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or subordinated
indebtedness;

   - create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions by subsidiaries;

   - make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;

   - merge, amalgamate or sell assets, including equity interests of subsidiaries;

   - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

   - engage in transactions with affiliates;

   - enter into new lines of business; and

   - enter into amendments of or waivers under subordinated indebtedness, organizational documents and
certain other material agreements.

The Credit Agreement requires that, until such time as we achieve a leverage ratio of less than 4.00 to 1.00,
certain additional restrictions have been placed on the Company and its subsidiaries, including, a $200 million
aggregate cap which applies to dividends, distributions, share repurchases and other restricted payments (which
amount may be reduced by the amount of investments made using such shared basked), an aggregate cap on
investments and acquisitions of $200 million (which amount may be reduced by the amount of restricted
payments made using such shared basket), and an aggregate cap on Permitted Acquisitions (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) of $500 million per annum (with a 50% carryover for unused amounts to the next succeeding
fiscal year) (unless, in each case, such investment or restricted payment can fit within other existing exceptions to
the Credit Agreement).

The Credit Agreement requires that we maintain a Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) not to exceed 3.00:1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through the fiscal quarter ending
March 31, 2019, stepping down to 2.75:1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019 and thereafter. The
Credit Agreement requires that we maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of
not less than 1.50:1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019,
stepping up to 1.75:1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019 and thereafter.

The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. If an
event of default, as specified in the Credit Agreement, shall occur and be continuing, the Company may be
required to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities. As of September 30, 2017, we were in
compliance with all covenants associated with the Credit Facilities. We periodically review our debt profile with
a view towards extending maturities and/or improving the terms of such debt. We may, from time to time, seek
amendments to such debt in order to effect any such changes.

Following the issuance of the secured notes and the application of the proceeds thereof to repay (on a pro
rata basis) a portion of our Series F Tranche B Term Loans outstanding, we are seeking to lower the interest rate

with respect to the remaining term loans under our Credit Agreement and effectuate other amendments with
respect thereto. After giving effect to such intended repricing, the Credit Facilities will continue to provide for a
$1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility (with bifurcated maturities as referred to above) and all Term Loan B
Facility loans will be consolidated into the Series F-4 Tranche B Term Loan. See “Summary—Recent
Developments—Credit Facility Amendment and Repricing.”

The March 2022 Senior Secured Notes and March 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees rank

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this section of the offering memorandum under the
subheading “—Certain Definitions”. In this section, (i) the term “Issuer” refers only to Valeant Pharmaceuticals
International, Inc., a British Columbia corporation, and its successors and not to any of its Subsidiaries and
(ii) the term “Valeant” refers only to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a Delaware corporation, and its
successors and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025
offered hereby (the “new secured notes”) under the indenture, dated as of October 17, 2017 (the “indenture”),
among the Issuer, the Note Guarantors, The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, and The Bank of New York
Mellon (together with certain of its branches, affiliates and agents) and Lord Securities Corporation (and/or
certain of its subsidiaries or affiliates), and those persons who become notes collateral agents for the notes
pursuant to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (the “Notes Collateral Agents”). There are
currently $1,000 million principal amount of initial secured notes outstanding (the “initial secured notes,” and,
together with the new secured notes, the “notes”). Immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the new
secured notes by this offering memorandum, we will have $1,750 million aggregate principal amount of our
5.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 outstanding. “Issue Date” and “date of the indenture” refer to
October 17, 2017, the date of the issuance of the initial secured notes. The indenture is not subject to the
provisions of the TIA. Holders of the notes are not entitled to any registration rights or similar rights.

The new secured notes will constitute “additional notes” under the indenture. Unless otherwise expressly
stated or the context otherwise requires, references to the “notes” in this “Description of the Secured Notes”
means the Issuer’s 5.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 issued under the indenture, including the initial
secured notes, the new secured notes and any other additional notes the Issuer may in the future issue under the
indenture. The new secured notes will have the same terms as the initial secured notes (other than the date of
original issuance and the issue price) and will be a part of the same class as the initial secured notes under the
indenture. All notes will vote together as a single class for all purposes of the indenture and will vote together as
one class on all matters with respect to the notes. The new secured notes will share the same CUSIP numbers and
ISINs as the initial secured notes except for notes issued pursuant to Regulation S for the first 40 days.

We have the right to issue additional notes in the future after this offering. Any such additional notes will
have the same terms as the initial secured notes and the new secured notes offered hereby but may be offered at a
different offering price or have a different initial interest payment date than the initial secured notes or the notes
being offered by this offering memorandum. If issued, these additional notes will become part of the same series
as the notes being offered by this offering memorandum.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture. It does not restate the
indenture in its entirety. We urge you to read the indenture because it, and not this description, defines your
rights as holders of the notes. Copies of the indenture are available as set forth below under “—Additional
Information”. Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions”
have the meanings assigned to them in the indenture.

The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. The registered holders of
the notes are those that own notes registered in their own names on the books that the Issuer or the Trustee
maintains for this purpose, and not those who own beneficial interests in the notes registered in street name or in
notes issued in book-entry form through one or more depositaries. Only registered holders will have rights under
the indenture. Owners of beneficial interests in the notes should read the information contained under the
subheading “—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue $750 million aggregate principal amount of new secured notes offered hereby.
Following this offering of the new secured notes, there will be $1,750 million aggregate principal amount of the
notes outstanding. The Issuer may issue additional notes under the indenture from time to time after this offering.
Any offering of additional notes is subject to the covenants described below under the captions “—Certain
Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.”
The new secured notes offered hereby will constitute additional notes as such term is defined in the indenture.
The new secured notes, initial secured notes and any additional notes subsequently issued under the indenture
will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the indenture, including, without limitation, waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. The Issuer will issue the notes in denominations of $2,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The notes will mature on November 1, 2025.

Interest on the new secured notes will accrue at the rate of 5.500% per annum. Interest on the new secured

Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding April 15 and

Interest on the new secured notes will accrue from October 17, 2017, the date of original issuance of the
initial secured notes or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Trustee initially acts as Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent for the notes. The Issuer may
change the Registrar, Transfer Agent or Paying Agent without prior notice to the holders, and the Issuer or any of
its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the indenture. The Registrar, the Transfer
Agent and the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and

50

transfer documents in connection with a transfer of notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on
transfer. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer is
not required to transfer or exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be redeemed.

**Note Guarantees**

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the indenture initially are jointly and severally guaranteed by
Valeant and those of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are obligors or guarantors under the Credit Agreement and the
Existing Notes as of the date of this offering memorandum, except that the notes are not guaranteed by two
entities that guarantee the Credit Agreement because these two entities have no material assets or operations and
are in the process of being dissolved.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, these non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders
of their debts and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer. As of
September 30, 2017, these non-guarantor Subsidiaries had an aggregate of $0.8 billion of liabilities outstanding
(excluding intercompany obligations), to which the notes would have been effectively subordinated.

If any subsidiary of the Issuer provides a Guarantee of any Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor under
any syndicated Credit Facility or Capital Markets Indebtedness, then such Subsidiary will promptly execute a
supplemental indenture pursuant to which it will Guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the Issuer’s obligations
under the notes and the indenture for so long as the Guarantee in connection with the applicable Indebtedness
remains in place. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Subsidiary shall be required to Guarantee the notes if any
such Guarantee shall be illegal or unenforceable under relevant law (after taking into account the limitations set
forth in the next succeeding paragraph), as determined in good faith by the Issuer.

The obligations of each Note Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
such Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. In addition, the obligations
of any Note Guarantor organized outside the United States of America may be limited as necessary or
appropriate to (1) comply with applicable law, (2) avoid any general legal limitations such as general statutory
limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims or similar
matters or (3) avoid a conflict with the fiduciary duties of such company’s directors, contravention of any legal
prohibition or regulatory condition, or the material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officers or
directors (collectively referred to as “Agreed Guarantee Principles”, in each case as determined by the Issuer in
its sole discretion). Such limitations could be significant.

A Note Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee and its obligations under
the indenture:

(1) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Note Guarantor,
by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the Equity Interests of such
Note Guarantor then held by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) if such Note Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or otherwise ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case in accordance with the provisions of the indenture, upon effectiveness of such
designation or when it first ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, respectively;

(3) in the case of any Guarantee issued on the Issue Date, upon the release or discharge of the Guarantee by
such Guarantor in respect of the Credit Agreement, and, in any other case, upon the release or discharge of any
Guarantee in respect of Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the Issue Date of the Note Guarantee by
such Note Guarantor; or

51


-----

(4) if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or if the obligations of the Issuer under the indenture are
discharged in accordance with the terms of the indenture.

**Security for the Notes**

**General**

The obligations under the notes are (or will be) secured by first priority liens granted by the Issuer, the Note
Guarantors and any future Note Guarantor on substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors
(whether now owned or hereafter arising or acquired) to the extent such assets are subject to a lien securing the
obligations under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions (including with respect to certain assets
that are (or will be) subject to a lien securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement but not securing the
notes), Permitted Liens and encumbrances described in the indenture and the Collateral Documents. The Issuer
and Note Guarantors took actions to perfect the security interests in certain assets of the Issuer or Note
Guarantors established under the laws of Canada, France and the United States on the Issue Date, but actions in
other jurisdictions are to be completed within 120 days of the Issue Date.

In the Collateral Documents, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions described
below or as set forth in the Collateral Documents, granted (or will grant) first priority liens in (collectively,
excluding the Excluded Assets, the “Collateral”):

(1) 100% of the Capital Stock of certain existing and future wholly owned material subsidiaries of the Issuer
or any Note Guarantors, subject to certain limitations, including limiting the pledges of Capital Stock of FirstTier Foreign Subsidiaries to 65% of such Capital Stock; and

(2) substantially all of the other property and assets (including, subject to certain exceptions and thresholds,
fee-owned real property and tangible and intangible personal property such as, among other assets, intellectual
property, investment property, accounts receivable (other than Securitization Program Assets), inventory,
equipment and contract rights), in each case, that are held by the Issuer or any of the Note Guarantors, but only to
the extent that such assets secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement and to the extent that a security
interest is able to be granted or perfected therein after use of commercially reasonable efforts by the Issuer and
applicable Note Guarantors.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions for New York Law intercreditor
agreements governing priority of claims among secured creditors. See “—Intercreditor Agreement.” While a
number of the Guarantors are incorporated, organized, or have their center of main interest in European
jurisdictions, including Belgium, Belarus, England, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Wales and United Arab Emirates,
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement does not contain provisions that typically would be included in these and
other local jurisdictions. For example, a typical European intercreditor agreement would address, on a contractual
basis, certain European insolvency and restructuring considerations which arise in the absence of consistent
statutory provisions in Europe equivalent to the framework under the Bankruptcy Code, including, among others,
provisions on standstill on the enforcement of liens on assets and on the making of claims on direct debt
obligations and guarantees, release or forced transfer of junior debt claims upon the occurrence of “distressed
disposals” during a restructuring or enforcement process and debt purchase options.

In addition, the lien of the collateral agent in the collateral was (or will be) created pursuant to security
documents entered into with the applicable collateral agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws
applicable to the creation and priority of collateral in the jurisdictions in which the collateral is pledged, will give
it, in most cases, as a matter of law, third priority to the rights of the collateral agent under the Credit Facility and
second priority to the rights of the collateral agents under the Existing Secured Notes. As a result, the first
priority lien of the holders of the notes with respect to the collateral is (or will be) dependent on the First Lien

52


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, which provides that the rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the collateral
are secured on a first priority basis and to which the collateral agent under the Credit Facility is a party. Such
agreement may not be recognized in certain jurisdictions.

The indenture and the Collateral Documents exclude (or will exclude) certain property from the Collateral
(the “Excluded Assets”), including:

(1) any lease, license, contract or agreement to which any grantor is a party, and any of its rights or interest
thereunder, if and to the extent that a security interest is prohibited by or in violation of (i) any law, rule or
regulation applicable to such grantor, or (ii) a term, provision or condition of any such lease, license, contract or
agreement (unless such law, rule, regulation, term, provision or condition would be rendered ineffective with
respect to the creation of the security interest hereunder pursuant to Section 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the
Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) (or any successor provision or provisions) of any relevant jurisdiction or
any other applicable law (including the Bankruptcy Code, the Personal Property Security Act of any applicable
Canadian province or territory (the “PPSA”) or the Civil Code of Quebec) or principles of equity); provided,
however, that the Collateral shall include (and such security interest shall attach) immediately at such time as the
contractual or legal prohibition shall no longer be applicable and to the extent severable, shall attach immediately
to any portion of such lease, license, contract or agreement not subject to the prohibitions specified in clause
(i) or (ii) above; provided further that the exclusions referred to in this clause (1) shall not include any proceeds
of any such lease, license, contract or agreement unless such proceeds result in the consequences described in
this clause (1) after giving effect to the first proviso in clause (1);

(2) Excluded Securities;

(3) any “intent-to-use” application for registration of a trademark filed pursuant to Section 1(b) of the
Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1051, prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” pursuant to Section 1(d) of the
Lanham Act or an “Amendment to Allege Use” pursuant to Section 1(c) of the Lanham Act with respect thereto,
solely to the extent, if any, that, and solely during the period, if any, in which, the grant of a security interest
therein would impair the validity or enforceability of any registration that issues from such intent-to-use
application under applicable Federal law;

(4) motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title to the extent that a Lien thereon cannot be
perfected by the filing of financing statements or similar filings under the UCC, PPSA or the Civil Code of
Quebec in the applicable grantor’s jurisdiction of organization or, if applicable, where such collateral is situated;

(5) Letter-of-Credit Rights (other than any Letter-of-Credit Rights constituting a Supporting Obligation (as
defined in the UCC) for a receivable or other Collateral in which the Notes Collateral Agents have a valid and
perfected security interest);

(6) Excluded Accounts;

(7) assets owned by any grantor on the date hereof or hereafter acquired and any proceeds thereof that are
subject to a Lien securing Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the indenture to the extent and for so
long as the contract or other agreement in which such Lien is granted (or the documentation providing for such
purchase money Indebtedness) validly prohibits the creation of any other Lien on such assets and proceeds;

(8) any property or assets in circumstances where the cost, burden or consequences (including adverse tax
consequences) of obtaining or perfecting a security interest in such property or assets, as determined in good faith
by the Issuer in writing, are excessive in relation to the practical benefit to the Holders of the notes afforded in
the indenture; provided that, if the Credit Agreement is then outstanding, the same determination is made in
respect of the Lien on such assets securing the Credit Agreement;

53


-----

(9) any property constituting or that is the proceeds of aircraft, aircraft engines, satellites, ships or railroad
rolling stock (unless any such property or assets are pledged as collateral in respect of the Credit Agreement);
and

(10) Rule 3-16 Capital Stock (as defined below); and

(11) so long as the Credit Agreement is outstanding, any asset that is not pledged to secure obligations
arising in respect of the Credit Agreement (whether pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement (and any
related documents) or as a result of any determination made thereunder, or by amendment, waiver or otherwise).

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in addition to other exceptions and limitations
described in the Collateral Documents, and notwithstanding any action described below that is taken in favor of
the Credit Agreement, in no event shall the Issuer or any Note Guarantor be required to (x) create any security
interests in assets located, titled, registered or filed outside of the Covered Jurisdictions or to perfect such
security interests or (y) deliver (A) control agreements, (B) landlord waivers, (C) bailee letters, (D) other similar
third party documents, or (E) security agreements, pledge agreements, or share charge (or mortgage) agreements
governed under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the Covered Jurisdictions.

The amount recoverable in respect of the Collateral provided by the Note Guarantors being subsidiaries of
the Issuer is (or will be) limited as necessary to (1) prevent such Collateral from being in breach of any
applicable law, (2) avoid any general legal limitations such as general statutory limitations, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims or similar matters or (3) avoid a conflict
with the fiduciary duties of such company’s directors, contravention of any legal prohibition or regulatory
condition, or the material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officers or directors, in each case as
determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion. Such limitations could significantly impact the amounts
recoverable upon the exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral.

In certain jurisdictions a security interest in certain assets can be pledged to or perfected with respect to (as
applicable) one secured party only (including tangible assets in Germany, accounts receivable and assignments of
rights under contracts in Germany and Poland, accounts receivable and assets the subject of an assignment in the
United Arab Emirates, and pledges of shares in Italian and United Arab Emirates companies) pursuant to local
laws governing such collateral or local practice applicable to such collateral. The Credit Agreement Collateral
Agent holding a lien on such assets will not be acting as agent for the benefit of the noteholders or holders of the
Existing Secured Notes and therefore the noteholders will not have a lien on such assets, and in such case the
Indenture does not require the Issuer and the Note Guarantors to grant liens on such assets. In addition, there is a
risk that, in Colombia, asset pledges subsequent to the pledges in favor of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent,
including the pledges intended to secure the Notes, may be determined to be invalid pursuant to local law where
the pledged asset is in the possession of the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent (as is the case for the pledge of
shares in the Issuer’s Colombian subsidiary). Further, the Indenture and the Security Agreement do not (or will
not) require the Issuer and the Guarantors to perfect by control security interest in deposit accounts, securities
accounts, commodities accounts or similar accounts and to perfect a security interest in certain other collateral,
including any asset if such asset does not constitute “Collateral” (or equivalent term) under the Credit Agreement
security documents or where the Issuer and the Guarantors are not required to take such actions under the Credit
Agreement security documents.

Subject to the foregoing, if property that is intended to be Collateral is acquired by the Issuer or a Note
Guarantor (including property of a Person that becomes a new Note Guarantor) and is not automatically subject
to a perfected security interest under the Collateral Documents, then the Issuer or such Note Guarantor will
provide a lien over such property consistent with the liens granted over similar property in the applicable
jurisdiction (or in the case of any jurisdiction where no liens were previously granted, to the extent customary
and reasonably achievable under applicable local law) (or, in the case of a new Note Guarantor, such of its
property consistent with the liens granted over similar property in the applicable jurisdiction (or in the case of

54


-----

any jurisdiction where no liens were previously granted, to the extent customary and reasonably achievable under
applicable local law)) in favor of the Notes Collateral Agents and deliver certain certificates and opinions in
respect thereof, all as and to the extent required by the indenture, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the
Collateral Documents.

As set out in more detail below, subject to certain exceptions, upon an enforcement event, insolvency or
liquidation proceeding, proceeds from the Shared Collateral will be applied to satisfy obligations under the Credit
Agreement and under the notes and under additional first lien debt that may be issued in the future that is subject
to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement on a pari passu basis. In addition, the indenture permits the Issuer and
the Note Guarantors to create additional Liens under specified circumstances.

The Collateral (1) has been pledged to Barclays Bank PLC (together with its permitted successors, the
“Credit Agreement Collateral Agent”), on a first priority basis, for the benefit of the secured parties under the
Credit Agreement to secure the obligations under the Credit Agreement, (2) has been pledged to the collateral
agents for the Existing Secured Notes for the benefit of the holders of the Existing Secured Notes to secure
obligations thereunder and (3) subject to certain exceptions, has been (or will be) pledged to the Notes Collateral
Agents, on a first priority basis, for its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the notes to
secure the obligations under the notes. Certain of the Shared Collateral that has already been pledged to the
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent will, pursuant to certain laws governing such Collateral, not be capable of
being pledged with same priority to the Notes Collateral Agent and will by way of being pledged later in time
rank junior to the existing security granted to the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the Existing Secured
Notes Collateral Agent. However, proceeds from enforcement of such Collateral are intended to be distributed
amongst the relevant secured parties in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement contains customary
provisions for a New York law intercreditor agreement, but does not contain any provisions that seek to address
European or other non-New York law insolvency and restructuring considerations typically available in
European or other non-New York law intercreditor agreements”.

To the extent that Liens (including Permitted Liens), rights or easements granted to third parties encumber
assets located on property owned by the Issuer or the Note Guarantors, including the Collateral, such third parties
may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that could adversely affect
the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Notes Collateral Agents, the Trustee or the Holders of the notes
to realize or foreclose on Collateral.

**_Certain bankruptcy and insolvency limitations_**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agents to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default (as described below under “—Events of Default and Remedies”) would be significantly
impaired by, or at a minimum delayed by, U.S. bankruptcy law in the event that a U.S. bankruptcy case, or
applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring legislation in the event that a Canadian
bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring case, were to be commenced by or against the Issuer or any Note
Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agents’ having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Upon the
commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, or under Canadian federal bankruptcy,
insolvency or restructuring legislation (such as the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) or the Companies’
Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada)) or under Canadian provincial receivership laws, a secured creditor such as
the Notes Collateral Agents are prohibited from repossessing or taking control of its security from the debtor in
the subject case, or from disposing of security without prior court approval (which may not be given under the
circumstances).

In view of the broad powers of U.S. and Canadian bankruptcy courts, and the lack of a precise definition of
the term “adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments
under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring

55


-----

case (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agents could
repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether
or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the
Collateral.

Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to
repay all amounts due on the notes, the holders of the notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the
value of the Collateral to which the holders of the notes are entitled, and unsecured claims with respect to such
shortfall. The Bankruptcy Code permits only the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs and
attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of such creditor’s
interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral.

In addition, because the Issuer and certain of the Note Guarantors are organized under federal or provincial
laws of Canada, as the case may be, the rights of the Notes Collateral Agents to enforce remedies on behalf of
holders are likely to be delayed and/or significantly impaired by the restructuring provisions of applicable
Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is
sought with respect to the Issuer or any Note Guarantor. For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act
(Canada) and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) contain provisions enabling an insolvent
person to obtain a stay of proceedings against its creditors and others, allowing it to retain possession and
administration of its property even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, so long
as the secured creditor is not unduly prejudiced having regard to the interest of the stakeholders generally. What
constitutes undue prejudice may vary according to the circumstances, but the concept is intended in general to
protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral. In some cases, the court will grant orders to
avoid undue prejudice to a secured creditor that may include cash payments, the granting of replacement liens or
replacement or additional collateral as security for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the
stay of repossession or the disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding. Both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and the Companies’
Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) contain provisions enabling an insolvent person to prepare and file a
proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement for consideration by all or some of its creditors to be voted on by
the various classes of its creditors affected thereby. Such a restructuring plan or proposal, if accepted by the
requisite majorities of creditors and if approved by the relevant Canadian court, would likely result in the
compromise or extinguishment of the rights of the holders of the notes under the notes and the indenture may
result in the relevant debtor retaining possession and administration of its property notwithstanding that an event
of default occurred under the notes.

The powers of the court under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and particularly under the
Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) have been exercised broadly to protect a restructuring entity
from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, in the event that the benefit of such legislation is
sought with respect to the Issuer or the Canadian Note Guarantors, the Issuer cannot predict if payments under
the notes would be made following commencement of or during any such proceeding, whether or when the Notes
Collateral Agents could exercise its rights under the indenture and the applicable Collateral Documents, whether
claims of holders could be compromised or extinguished under such a proceeding or whether and to what extent
holders would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the
fees and disbursements of the Notes Collateral Agents.

**_Release of liens_**

The Collateral Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the indenture provide that the first
priority liens securing the Note Guarantee of any Note Guarantor will be automatically released when such Note
Guarantor’s Note Guarantee is released in accordance with the terms of the indenture. In addition, the first
priority liens securing the notes will be released (a) in whole, upon a legal defeasance or a covenant defeasance

56


-----

of the notes as set forth below under “—Defeasance,” (b) in whole, upon satisfaction and discharge of the
indenture, (c) in whole, upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the notes issued
under the indenture, (d) in whole or in part, with the consent of the requisite holders of the notes in accordance
with the provisions under “—Amendments and Waivers,” including consents obtained in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, notes and (e) in part, as to any asset (A)(I) constituting
Collateral that is sold or otherwise disposed of by the Issuer or any of the Note Guarantors to any Person that is
not an Issuer or a Note Guarantor in a transaction permitted by the indenture (to the extent of the interest sold or
disposed of), or (II) constituting Shared Collateral, in connection with the taking of an enforcement action by the
Applicable Authorized Representative and Applicable Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement) in respect of any first priority lien obligations in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, (B) that is held by a Note Guarantor that ceases to be a Note Guarantor, (C) that becomes Excluded
Assets, including so long as the Credit Agreement is outstanding, any asset that is not pledged to secure
obligations arising in respect of the Credit Agreement (whether pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement
(and any related documents) or as a result of any determination made thereunder, or by amendment, waiver or
otherwise) or (D) that is otherwise released in accordance with, and as expressly provided for by the terms of, the
indenture, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral Documents; provided that in the case of
clause (e)(A)(II), the proceeds of such Shared Collateral shall be applied in accordance with the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Capital Stock of any Subsidiary of the Issuer will constitute Collateral securing the notes and the related
Note Guarantees only to the extent that such Capital Stock can secure the notes and Note Guarantees without
Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X (or any other law, rule or regulation) requiring separate financial statements of the
Issuer or such Subsidiary to be filed with the SEC (or any other governmental agency), determined as if the
Issuer was subject to Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X (or any other law or regulation). In the event that Rule 3-16 of
Regulation S-X requires or is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another
rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC
(or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of the Issuer or any such Subsidiary due to
the fact that such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock secures the notes and the Note Guarantees, then such Capital Stock
shall automatically be deemed not to be part of the Collateral securing the notes and Note Guarantees (but only to
the extent necessary to not be subject to such requirement) (such Capital Stock, the “Rule 3-16 Capital Stock”).
In such event, the Collateral Documents may be amended or modified, without the consent of any holder, to the
extent necessary to release the security interests on the Rule 3-16 Capital Stock that are so deemed to no longer
constitute part of the Collateral.

In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X is amended, modified or interpreted by the SEC to permit (or
is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted, which would permit)
such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock to secure the notes and the Note Guarantees in excess of the amount then
pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of
the Issuer or any such Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary shall automatically be deemed to be
a part of the Collateral securing the notes and Note Guarantees (but only to the extent such Subsidiary would not
be subject to any such financial statement requirement). In such event, the Collateral Documents may be
amended or modified, without the consent of any holder, to the extent necessary to subject such Capital Stock to
the Liens under the Collateral Documents.

**_Perfection and non-perfection of security interests in collateral_**

The security interest of the Notes Collateral Agents in certain of the Collateral was not established on the
Issue Date. To the extent any liens on or security interest in the Collateral securing the notes were not perfected
on or prior to such date, the indenture requires us to use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such
security interests perfected, to the extent required by the indenture and the Collateral Documents, within
120 days of the Issue Date, however no assurance can be given that such security interest will be granted or
perfected on a timely basis. In addition, the Collateral Documents generally do not (or will not) require the Issuer

57


-----

and the Note Guarantors to take certain actions to perfect the liens of the Notes Collateral Agents in certain of the
Collateral, including, prior to the repayment in full of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, if such actions
are not requested by the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral. As a result, the first
priority liens may not attach or be perfected in certain of the Collateral, which could adversely affect the rights of
the holders of the notes with respect to such Collateral.

**_After-acquired property_**

The indenture provides that, from and after the Issue Date, upon the acquisition by the Issuer or any Note
Guarantor of any After-Acquired Property that is required to become Collateral under the indenture or any
Collateral Document or upon any new Subsidiary becoming a Note Guarantor, the Issuer or such Note Guarantor
shall execute and deliver such mortgages, deeds of trust, security instruments, financing statements, certificates
and opinions of counsel as shall be necessary to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security interest,
subject only to Permitted Liens, in such After-Acquired Property or in the Collateral of such Note Guarantor and
to have such After-Acquired Property or such Collateral (but subject to certain limitations, if applicable,
including as described under “—Security”) added to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the indenture
relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such After-Acquired Property or Collateral to the same
extent and with the same force and effect; provided, however, that if granting such security interest in such AfterAcquired Property or Collateral requires the consent of a third party, the Issuer will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such consent with respect to the security interest for the benefit of the Trustee and the Notes
Collateral Agent on behalf of the Holders of the notes; provided further, however, that if such third party does not
consent to the granting of such security interest after the use of such commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer
or such Note Guarantor, as the case may be, will not be required to provide such security interest.

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Notes Collateral Agents became a party to an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended
from time to time, the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the
collateral agents for the Existing Secured Notes with respect to the Shared Collateral, which may be amended
from time to time without the consent of the holders to add other parties holding first priority obligations
permitted to be incurred under the indenture, the Credit Agreement and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
(“First Priority Obligations”). All references to the First Priority Obligations in this section of the Description of
Notes shall refer only to such First Priority Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” or
“Applicable Collateral Agent” has the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral.
The Applicable Authorized Representative was on the Issue Date (and continues to be) the Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent and will remain the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of
First Priority Obligations that are obligations under the Credit Agreement and (2) the Non-Applicable Authorized
Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below) (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized
Representative Change Date”). After the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date, the Applicable
Authorized Representative will be the representative (other than the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent) of the
Series of First Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then
outstanding Series of First Priority Obligations as such representative is notified by the Issuer (excluding the
Series constituting the obligations under the Credit Agreement) with respect to such Shared Collateral, but solely
to the extent that such Series of First Priority Obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount than the Series
of obligations then outstanding under the Credit Agreement as determined by the Issuer (the “Major
Non-Applicable Authorized Representative”). As of the Issue Date the trustee for the Existing Secured Notes
shall be deemed to be the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative and shall remain the Major
Non-Applicable Authorized Representative until such time as it is notified in writing by the Issuer or the
Applicable Authorized Representative that another representative is the Major Non-Applicable Authorized
Representative. The Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a prompt written notice to the

58


-----

Trustee and the Applicable Authorized Representative upon any such determination, it being understood that the
Issuer shall be entitled to rely upon certifications from the applicable representative in making such
determination.

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no representative of a Series of First Priority Obligations that is not
the Applicable Authorized Representative (“Non-Applicable Authorized Representative”), the Applicable
Collateral Agent or the holders of indebtedness for which such Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is a
representative (“Non-Controlling Secured Party”) shall be permitted to instruct the Applicable Authorized
Representative or Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings
with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator, examiner or similar official appointed for or over,
attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take
any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of,
any Shared Collateral or have a right to consent to any such action. Only the Applicable Authorized
Representative and/or the Applicable Collateral Agent shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any
such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral.

The “Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any
Non-Applicable Authorized Representative, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such
Non-Applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative) after the
occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable
Series of First Priority Obligations, and (b) the Applicable Authorized Representative and each other
representative of First Priority Obligations’ (each such representative of First Priority Obligations, a “First
Priority Collateral Agent”) receipt of written notice from such Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative
certifying that (i) such Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Applicable Authorized
Representative and that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of
First Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Priority Obligations of that Series with
respect to which such Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are
currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the
indenture or debt facility for that Series of First Priority Obligations; provided that the Non-Applicable
Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have
occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative has
commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or (2) at
any time the Issuer or the Notes Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a
debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The Applicable Authorized Representative and the Applicable Collateral Agent each was on the Issue Date
(and each continues to be) the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, and no Notes Collateral Agent will have any
rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless
and until the Trustee becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative and/or Applicable Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens, the Applicable Authorized Representative may deal with the
Shared Collateral as if the Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral. No
Non-Applicable Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party will be permitted to contest,
protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized Representative or
any holders of indebtedness for which the Applicable Authorized Representative is a representative (“Controlling
Secured Party”) or any other exercise by the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured
Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. Each of the Holders of the notes and secured
parties under the Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes and the and the holders of any additional first
lien debt that may be issued in the future that is subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (the “First
Priority Secured Parties”) also agree that they will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any
proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or
enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the
Shared Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of First Priority
Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Applicable
Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made
with respect to any Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring case of the Issuer (including
any adequate protection payments) or any Note Guarantor, or any First Priority Secured Party receives any
payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect
to any Shared Collateral, then the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared
Collateral by any First Priority Collateral Agent or any First Priority Secured Party and proceeds of any such
distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, to the paragraph immediately following) to
which the First Priority Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement shall be applied among
the First Priority Obligations to the payment in full of the First Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, after
payment of all amounts owing to each First Priority Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such); provided that
following the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring case of the Issuer or any other
Notes Guarantor, solely for purposes of the waterfall provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and not
any other document with respect to any First Priority Obligation, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is
not sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest on the First Priority Obligations to be allowed under
Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or
other applicable law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of First Priority Obligations of
each Series of First Priority Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest
allowable under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The First Priority Secured Parties of each Series agree that the holders of First Priority Obligations of such
Series (and not the First Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Priority Obligations of such Series are unenforceable
under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Priority
Obligations), (y) any of the First Priority Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest
in any of the Shared Collateral securing any other Series of First Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening
security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Priority Obligations) on a
basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Priority Obligations but junior to the security
interest of any other Series of First Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Shared Collateral for any
other Series of First Priority Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such
Series); provided that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to any properties subject to a Mortgage (as
defined in the Credit Agreement (or the equivalent provision thereof)) which applies to all First Priority
Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Priority Obligations. In the event of
any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be
borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such
Series of First Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of
such Series of First Priority Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are
borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Priority Obligations subject to such Impairment.

Additionally, in the event the First Priority Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable
law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or pursuant to a
restructuring under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada), any reference to such First Priority
Obligations or the Collateral Documents governing such First Priority Obligations will be deemed to refer to
such obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the First Priority Secured Parties may institute in any bankruptcy case or other proceeding any
claim against the Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First Priority Secured Party seeking
damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any

60


-----

Shared Collateral. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may challenge, or support any other Person in
challenging, in any proceeding the validity or enforceability of any First Priority Obligations of any Series or any
first priority security document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under any first
priority security document or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or
other provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may take or
cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any
manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared
Collateral by the Applicable Authorized Representative or Applicable Collateral Agent. In addition, none of the
First Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any
foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Priority Secured Party obtains possession
of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Collateral
Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any
time prior to the discharge of each of the First Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral,
proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared
Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative
forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition
thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor
of the other First Priority Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes and each
other Series of First Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and
discharged upon conclusion of the applicable foreclosure proceeding or other exercise of remedies. However, any
proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

If the Issuer or any Note Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Note Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval
of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of
the Bankruptcy Code (or under Section 11.2 of the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada),
Section 50.6 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada), or under any equivalent provision of any other
applicable debtor relief law) or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (or under
Sections 11 or 36 of the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada), Section 65.13 of the Bankruptcy and
Insolvency Act (Canada) or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable debtor relief law), each First
Priority Secured Party agrees not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing
the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless
the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Shared Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP
Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing
Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties,
each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same
terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Priority Secured Parties
constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens
rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Priority Obligations of
the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to
such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) First Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared
Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such
proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of
the First Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the
insolvency or liquidation proceedings;

61


-----

(B) the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to
any First Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or
use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Priority Secured Parties as set forth in the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Priority
Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and

(D) if any First Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic
payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate
protection are applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

_provided that the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_
secure the DIP Financing over any collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Priority Secured Parties of such
Series or its or their representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that the First
Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection agree that they shall not object to any other First Priority
Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Priority
Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The First Priority Secured Parties therein acknowledge that the First Priority Obligations of any Series may,
subject to the limitations set forth in the other documents governing the First Priority Obligations, be increased,
extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise
amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds
set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of
the First Priority Secured Parties of any Series.

By its acceptance of notes, each holder will be deemed to have consented to the terms of the Collateral
Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Trustee and each
Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, to execute, deliver and perform each of the Collateral Documents and First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to which it is a party, binding the holders to the terms thereof.

Subject to the terms of the Collateral Documents, the Issuer and the Note Guarantors have the right to
remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Shared Collateral securing the notes (other than any cash,
securities, obligations and Cash Equivalents constituting part of the Collateral and deposited with the Applicable
Authorized Representative in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Documents and other than as set
forth in the Collateral Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any
income therefrom.

**_No impairment of the security interests_**

Except as otherwise permitted under the indenture, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral
Documents, none of the Issuer nor any of the Note Guarantors will be permitted to take any action, or knowingly
omit to take any action, which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing the security
interest with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agents and the Holders
of the notes.

**_Amendment of Collateral Documents_**

The Issuer is not permitted to amend, modify or supplement, or agree to permit or consent to any
amendment, modification or supplement of, the Collateral Documents in any way that would be adverse to the
holders of the notes in any material respect, except as described above under “—Security” or as permitted under
“—Amendments and Waivers.”

62


-----

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the notes, or by or on behalf of any
Note Guarantor under or with respect to any Note Guarantee (each such person, a “Payor”) will be made free and
clear of any withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other
governmental charge of whatever nature (collectively, “Tax”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any
jurisdiction in which such Payor is organized, resident or carrying on business for tax purposes or from or
through which such Payor makes any payment on the notes or its Note Guarantee or any department or political
subdivision of any of the foregoing (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless the Payor (or an applicable
withholding agent) is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If the Payor (or an applicable withholding
agent) is required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes of a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to any notes or Note Guarantee, the Payor, subject to
the exceptions listed below, will pay additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure
that the net amount received by each holder or beneficial owner of the notes after such withholding or deduction
(including withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts payable hereunder) will not be less than
the amount the holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be so
withheld or deducted.

A Payor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a holder or beneficial owner of notes:

(a) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but
for the existence of any present or former connection between the holder or beneficial owner (or between a
fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder or
beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any connection resulting solely from the acquisition, ownership,
holding or disposition of notes, the receipt of payments thereunder or under any Note Guarantee and/or the
exercise or enforcement of rights under any notes or any Note Guarantee);

(b) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but
for the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of notes, following the Issuer’s or the Payor’s written
request addressed to the holder, to the extent such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so, to
comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required
by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition
to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not
resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(c) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, capital gains, excise or personal property
tax or any similar Taxes;

(d) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but
for the presentation by the holder or beneficial owner of any notes, where presentation is required, for
payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date
on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(e) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but
for the holder or beneficial owner not dealing at arm’s length, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act
(Canada), with such Payor;

(f) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for
such holder or beneficial owner being, or not dealing at arm’s length (within the meaning of the Income Tax
_Act (Canada)) with, a “specified shareholder” of the Issuer as defined in subsection 18(5) of the Income Tax_
_Act (Canada) for purposes of the thin capitalization rules in the Income Tax Act (Canada);_

(g) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts are U.S. federal withholding taxes
imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the

63


-----

“Code”), as in effect on the date of the issuance of the initial secured notes (or any amended or successor
version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or
future regulations, official interpretations or administrative authority promulgated thereunder and any
agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code as in effect on the date of the issuance
of the initial secured notes (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not
materially more onerous to comply with), and, for the avoidance of doubt, any intergovernmental agreement
(and related legislation, rules or practices) implementing the foregoing (taken together, “FATCA”), except
to the extent that such Taxes result from a failure of any Paying Agent to comply with FATCA; or

(h) any combination of items (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g).

Additional Amounts also will not be paid with respect to any payment on a note to a beneficial owner who
is a fiduciary, a partnership (or entity treated as a partnership for tax purposes), or anyone other than the sole
beneficial owner of that payment to the extent that payment would be required by the laws of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction to be included in the income, for tax purposes, of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the
fiduciary, a member of that partnership or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to the Additional
Amounts had that beneficiary, settlor, member or interest holder been the beneficial owner.

The Payor or applicable withholding agent will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by
applicable law and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance
with applicable law. The Payor, as the applicable withholding agent, will make reasonable efforts to obtain
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor, as the applicable withholding agent, will provide to the
Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld are due
pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy of tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts
are not reasonably available to the Payor, such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such
payment by the Payor.

Where Tax is payable pursuant to Regulation 803 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) by a holder or beneficial
owner of the notes in respect of any amount payable under the notes to the holder (other than by reason of a
transfer of the notes to a person resident in Canada with whom the transferor does not deal at arm’s length for the
purposes of such Act), but no Additional Amount is paid in respect of such Tax, the Payor will pay as or on
account of interest to the holder an amount equal to such Tax (a “Regulation 803 Reimbursement”) plus an
amount equal to any Tax required to be paid by the holder or beneficial owner as a result of such Regulation 803
Reimbursement within 45 days after receiving from the holder a notice containing reasonable particulars of the
Tax so payable, provided such holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to receive Additional
Amounts on account of such Tax (and only to the extent of such Additional Amounts that such holder or
beneficial owner would have been entitled to receive) but for the fact that it is payable otherwise than by
deduction or withholding from payments made under or with respect to the notes.

The Payor will deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be
payable prior to the date on which such payments will be made, and the amounts so payable, and will set forth
such other information necessary to enable the Trustee (or applicable paying agent) to pay such Additional
Amounts to holders on the payment date. Any such certificate will be delivered a reasonable amount of time in
advance of when the payments in question are required to be made. The Payor will promptly publish a notice in
accordance with the provisions of the indenture stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and
describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

The Payors, jointly and severally, will reimburse the holders or beneficial owners of notes, upon written
request of such holder or beneficial owner of notes and certified proof of payment for the amount of (i) any
Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such holder or beneficial owner in
connection with payments made under or with respect to the notes or under or with respect to any Note

64


-----

Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with respect to any reimbursement under the foregoing clause
(i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such holder or beneficial owner after such reimbursement
will not be less than the net amount such holder or beneficial owner would have received if the Taxes giving rise
to the reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the
indemnification obligation provided for in this paragraph shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the holder
or beneficial owner of the notes would not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional Amounts
hereunder by virtue of clauses (a) through (h) above or to the extent such holder or beneficial owner received
Additional Amounts with respect to such payments.

In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar
taxes, charges and duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction at any time in respect of the execution, issuance, registration or delivery of the notes or any Note
Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties
imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any payments
made pursuant to the notes or any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to
thereunder and/or (ii) the enforcement of the notes or any Note Guarantee or any other such document or
instrument referred to thereunder.

The obligations described under this heading will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the
indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to any Payor and to any jurisdiction in which
such successor is organized, carrying on business or is otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction
from or through which payment is made by such successor or its respective agents. Whenever the indenture in
this “Description of the Notes” refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or
any other amount payable under or with respect to any note or under any Note Guarantee, such reference includes
the payment of Additional Amounts or indemnification payments as described hereunder, if applicable.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to November 1, 2020, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of notes (including notes issued after the Issue Date) issued under the indenture at
a redemption price of 105.500% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of notes (including notes issued after the Issue Date)
issued under the indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding
notes held by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

On or after November 1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem all or a part of the notes upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth
below plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed, to, but not including, the applicable redemption
date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on November 1 of the years indicated below:

2020 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 102.750%
2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 101.375%
2022 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

At any time prior to November 1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a
redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. The Issuer shall calculate the redemption price,
including any Applicable Premium.

65


-----

**_Notice of Redemption_**

In connection with any optional redemption of the notes, any such redemption may, at the Issuer’s
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. If a redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent, the applicable redemption notice shall describe such condition, and if applicable,
shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied, without the requirement of an additional notice period to the holders, or such
redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.

**_Optional Redemption due to Tax Reasons_**

If the Issuer or any Note Guarantor becomes obligated to pay, on the next date on which any amount will be
payable with respect to the notes, any Additional Amounts as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the
laws or regulations of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above) which amendment or change is publicly
announced and becomes effective after the date of the issuance of the initial secured notes (or, if the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the date of the issuance of the
initial secured notes, after such later date) or (ii) any amendment to, or change in, an official written
interpretation or application of such laws or regulations (including by virtue of a holding by a court of competent
jurisdiction) which amendment or change is publicly announced and becomes effective after the date of the
issuance of the initial secured notes (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the date of the issuance of the initial secured notes, after such later date) (each of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a “Change in Tax Law”) and the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor cannot
avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it (including making payment
through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction, but not including the substitution of an obligor if the
Issuer would be required to pay Additional Amounts), the Issuer may, at its option, redeem the notes then
outstanding, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), provided,
however, that if such right to redeem is triggered by the obligation of a Note Guarantor to pay Additional
Amounts, such right to redeem will apply only if the payment giving rise to such obligation cannot be made by
the Issuer or another Note Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts. Notice of the Issuer’s
intent to redeem the notes shall not be given until the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax
counsel to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the
notes hereunder and an officer’s certificate to the effect that the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor cannot
avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it. The foregoing
provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to the Issuer or the applicable Note Guarantor,
after such successor Person becomes a party to the indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law that is
publicly announced and becomes effective after such successor Person becomes a party to the indenture.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the notes as
described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of the holders.”

**Other Purchases**

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time attempt to acquire or acquire notes by
means other than a redemption, whether pursuant to an issuer tender offer, open market purchases or otherwise,
assuming such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the indenture; provided, that this paragraph

66


-----

does not provide the Issuer with any additional rights to redeem the notes other than as explicitly provided for in
the indenture. In connection with any such acquisition, the Issuer may seek and obtain holders’ consent to
amendments to the indenture.

**Repurchase at the Option of the Holders**

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all
or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s notes pursuant to
an offer (the “Change of Control Offer”) on the terms set forth in the indenture. In the Change of Control Offer,
the Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased
plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes repurchased to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the “Change of
Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will transmit a notice to each
holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase
notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days
and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the
indenture (or in accordance with the procedures of the depositary) and described in such notice. The Issuer will
comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase
of the notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the indenture by virtue of such conflict.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes
or portions of notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes properly accepted together with an officers’
certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes or portions of notes being purchased by the Issuer.

The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or transmit by wire transfer) to each holder of notes properly
tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or
cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased
portion of the notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the holders of the notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of
negotiations between the Issuer and the initial purchasers. Management evaluates transactions which could result
in a Change of Control from time to time and may engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control in the
future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the

67


-----

Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Incurrence
of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Liens”. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes upon a Change
of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer with respect to the notes in the manner, at the
times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change
of Control Offer, (2) notice of redemption with respect to the notes has been given pursuant to the indenture as
described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the
applicable redemption price, or (3) after giving effect to such Change of Control, (i) no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the Change of Control transaction has been approved by the Board of
Directors of the Issuer, and (iii) the notes have received an Investment Grade Rating. In addition, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of launching the Change of Control Offer.

The provisions under the indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
notes as a result of a Change of Control (including any required notice period) may be waived or modified with
the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes, including after the entry into of
an agreement that would result in the need to make a Change of Control Offer.

With respect to the notes, in the event that holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer
purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, within 60 days of such purchase,
the Issuer will have the right, upon not less than 30 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, to redeem all of
the notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the
ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as
a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

**Asset Sales**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale
unless:

(1) the Issuer (or its Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the
Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (determined, for purposes of this clause (1), by the Issuer or, in
the case of any asset(s) valued in excess of $750.0 million, by the Board of Directors) of the assets or Equity
Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale
by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.

68


-----

(3) For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as shown on the Issuer’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to
the notes and the Note Guarantees) (i) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to an
agreement that releases the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability or (ii) that are
discharged by the transferee in a transaction pursuant to which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted
Subsidiary has any liability following such Asset Sale;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary
from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days
after the consummation of the applicable Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion;
and

(c) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken
together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does
not exceed at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value
of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of $800.0 million or 3.0% of Consolidated Total Assets.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Issuer or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to those Net Proceeds:

(1) to repay (x) Indebtedness and other Obligations under the Credit Agreement and, if the Indebtedness
repaid under the Credit Agreement is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments
with respect thereto, (y) Indebtedness and other Obligations under the notes or any Pari Passu Indebtedness
(other than the Credit Agreement) and, if the Pari Passu Indebtedness being repaid is revolving credit
Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto (provided that if such Net Proceeds
are applied to repay such Pari Passu Indebtedness under this clause (y), the Issuer shall equally and ratably
reduce obligations under the notes in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption,”
through privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases (in each case, provided that such purchases
are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof), or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures
set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, the pro rata principal amount of the notes) or (z) other
Indebtedness of a Subsidiary that does not Guarantee the notes, so long as the relevant assets were assets of such
Subsidiary;

(2) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted
Business or the minority interest of any Permitted Business;

(3) to make payments with respect to the acquisition or license of intellectual property rights that are used in
a Permitted Business;

(4) to make a capital expenditure in or that is useful in a Permitted Business;

(5) to retire notes (x) pursuant to the provisions set forth under “—Optional Redemption,” (y) through
privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases, or (z) by making an offer to purchase notes in
accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer;

(6) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets (for the avoidance of doubt, including
acquisitions of in-process research and development) under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted
Business;

_provided that a binding commitment to apply any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale as set forth in clauses (2), (3),_
(4) or (6) above shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment

69


-----

so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation
that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of the end of such 450-day
period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary shall be permitted to apply the Net Proceeds in any manner set forth above before the
expiration of such 180-day period and, in the event the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary fails to do so, then
such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below).

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not
be required to apply an amount equal to any Net Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent
that the aggregate Net Proceeds from all Asset Sales which are not applied in accordance with this covenant
exceed the greater of $275.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of receipt of such Net
Proceeds. Pending application of an amount equal to Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds
in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding two
paragraphs will constitute “Excess Proceeds”. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the
greater of $275.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, the Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale
Offer”) to all holders of notes and all holders of other Pari Passu Indebtedness containing provisions similar to
those set forth in the indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to
purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased
out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase, and will be payable
in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset
Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness will be
purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be
reset at zero.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection
with each repurchase of notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Asset Sale provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The agreements governing the Issuer’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ other Indebtedness, including any
Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes, may contain prohibitions of certain events, including events that would
constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale. In addition, the exercise by the holders of notes of their right to
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale may cause a default
under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control or Asset Sale itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchases on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of notes upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
the Notes—The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes if it experiences a change of control”.

70


-----

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer elects to redeem less than all of the notes at any time, the notes will be selected for redemption
as follows:

(1) in accordance with the procedures of DTC and in compliance with the requirements of the applicable
stock exchange to the extent the notes are held in the form of Global Notes; or

(2) on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate to the extent the
notes are held in definitive form.

No notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail
to holders of certificated notes (or otherwise transmitted to registered holders of global notes in accordance with
applicable procedures of the depositary) at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each
holder of notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than
60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the indenture.

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that note that is to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the holder of notes upon cancellation of the
original note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption.

On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of them called for
redemption.

**Certain Covenants**

**Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade**

In the event of the occurrence of a Fall Away Event (and notwithstanding the failure of the Issuer
subsequently to maintain an Investment Grade Rating), the covenants and provisions described below under the
captions:

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(4) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”; and

(6) clause (4) of the covenant described under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”, shall each no
longer be in effect for the remaining term of the notes.

**Restricted Payments**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any

71


-----

merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect
holders of the Issuer’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than
dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or to the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer);

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection
with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer) any Equity Interests of the Issuer or any direct or indirect
parent of the Issuer;

(3) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled
repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor that is
contractually subordinated in right of payment to the notes or a Note Guarantee, except (i) from the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or (ii) the purchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement
of any such Indebtedness made in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or
final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such purchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to
as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such
Restricted Payment;

(2) the Issuer would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if
such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been
permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set
forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Preferred Stock”; and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after January 30, 2015 (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by
clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (11), (12) and (13) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the
sum, without duplication, of:

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting period)
from October 1, 2014 to the end of the Issuer’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal
financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net
Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit), plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds (or the fair market value of assets) received by the Issuer
since January 30, 2015 as a contribution to its common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity
Interests of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or from the issue or sale of convertible or
exchangeable Disqualified Stock or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of the Issuer that have been
converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or
debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer), plus

(c) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after January 30, 2015 is sold for cash or
otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash, the lesser of (i) the cash return of capital with respect to such
Restricted Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any) or (ii) the initial amount of such Restricted
Investment, plus

(d) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer is redesignated as a Restricted
Subsidiary after January 30, 2015, the lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of the Issuer’s Investment in such

72


-----

Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation or (ii) such Fair Market Value as of the date on which such
Subsidiary was originally designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, plus

(e) $3.7 billion.

As of September 30, 2017, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (3) above would
have been approximately $9.7 billion.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend, if at the date of
declaration the dividend payment would have complied with the provisions of the indenture (it being understood
that the amount of any such dividend shall be included in the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments
determined in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph only once and not as separate Restricted Payments made at
both declaration and payment);

(2) any Restricted Payment made in exchange for, or in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of, the
substantially concurrent sale (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Equity Interests
of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock); provided that an amount equal to such Restricted Payment will be
excluded from clause (3)(b) of the preceding paragraph;

(3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase or other acquisition or retirement of subordinated Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor with the net cash proceeds from, or in exchange for, an incurrence of
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) the payment of any dividend or any other payment or distribution by a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer to the holders of its Equity Interests of any class on a pro rata basis to holders of such class;

(5) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the repurchase, redemption or
other acquisition or retirement for value of Equity Interests of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the

Issuer held by any present or former employee, director, officer or consultant of, or service provider to, the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any management equity plan or stock option plan or any
other management or employee benefit plan or agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any principal
and interest payable on any notes issued by the Issuer in connection with any such repurchase, retirement or other
acquisition), or any stock subscription or shareholder agreement; provided that the aggregate amount of
Restricted Payments made under this clause (5) shall not exceed in any calendar year $25.0 million (with unused
amounts for any year being carried over to the next succeeding year, but not to any subsequent year, with the
permitted amount for each year being used prior to any amount carried over from the previous year); provided
further that such amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed:

(i) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies received by the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries after the Issue Date; less

(ii) the amount of any Restricted Payments previously made with the cash proceeds described in
subclause (i) of this clause (5);

(6) payments to holders of Equity Interests (or to the holders of Indebtedness that is convertible into or
exchangeable for Equity Interests upon such conversion or exchange) in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares;

(7) repurchases of Equity Interests deemed to occur in connection with the exercise or vesting of stock
options or similar instruments to the extent necessary to pay withholding or similar taxes related to such exercise
or vesting of stock options or similar instruments;

73


-----

(8) [Reserved];

(9) repurchases or retirement for value of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options or
warrants if such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of such options or warrants;

(10) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any subordinated
Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock pursuant to provisions similar to those described under the captions
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales”; provided that, prior thereto, all notes tendered by holders in connection with a Change of Control Offer or
Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value;

(11) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration and payment
of dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
issued in accordance with the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
of Preferred Stock”;

(12) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, other Restricted Payments;
provided, however, that if the Total Leverage Ratio as of the date of any Restricted Payment to be made pursuant
to this clause (12) is greater than or equal to 3.50 to 1.0, such Restricted Payment shall be permitted to be made
pursuant to this clause (12) only if the amount of such Restricted Payment, when taken together with the amount
of all other Restricted Payments previously made pursuant to this clause (12) when the Total Leverage Ratio was
greater than or equal to 3.50 to 1.0, does not exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate; and

(13) the distribution, as a dividend or otherwise, of shares of Capital Stock of, or Indebtedness owed to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary by, Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value (determined, for
purposes of this covenant, by the Issuer or, in the case of any asset(s) valued in excess of $750.0 million, by the
Board of Directors) on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred
or issued by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. For
purposes of determining compliance with this “Restricted Payments” covenant, in the event that a Restricted
Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in clauses (1) through (13) above,
including the first paragraph of this covenant or the definition of “Permitted Investment,” the Issuer will be
permitted to classify such Restricted Payment and later reclassify all or a portion of such Restricted Payment in
any manner that complies with this covenant. In addition, a Restricted Payment need not be permitted solely by
reference to one provision permitting such Restricted Payment but may be permitted in part by one such
provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Restricted Payment.

As of September 30, 2017, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (5) above would
have been approximately $50 million.

**Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise
(collectively, “incur”), with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Issuer will not issue
any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock; provided, however, that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue preferred stock if
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is
incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined

74


-----

on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional
Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be,
at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of
Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed $2,500.0 million;

(2) the incurrence by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness including the
Existing Secured Notes;

(3) the incurrence by the Issuer and the Note Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the initial secured
notes issued on the Issue Date and the Note Guarantees (including any future Note Guarantees);

(4) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by Capital
Lease Obligations in an aggregate amount, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund,
refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed the greater of (x)
$275.0 million and (y) 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at any time outstanding;

(5) mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing
all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used
in the business of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, in an aggregate principal amount,
including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness
incurred pursuant to this clause (5), not to exceed the greater of (x) $675.0 million and (y) 2.5% of Consolidated
Total Assets at any time outstanding;

(6) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness
in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace, Indebtedness (other than
intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this
covenant or clauses (2), (3), (12) or (14) of this paragraph or this clause (6) or, solely to the extent of the excess
(if any) of the amount of Indebtedness incurred and outstanding under clause (20) prior to the applicable
refinancing over the maximum aggregate amount permitted to be incurred and outstanding under clause (20) at
the time of such refinancing, clause (20) of this paragraph;

(7) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between
or among the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:

(a) if a Note Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the obligee is not the Issuer or another
Note Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated (without regard to security interest) to
the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the notes; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness
being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer and (ii) any sale or other
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer
will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that is not permitted by this clause (7);

(8) (i) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are
incurred and not for speculative purposes and (ii) the incurrence by a Securitization Special Purpose Entity of
Indebtedness in a Qualified Securitization Transaction that is without recourse to the Issuer or to any other
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or their assets (other than Standard Securitization Undertakings);

75


-----

(9) the Guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer of Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary that was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant (other than the
Note Guarantees); provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the
notes or any Note Guarantee, then the Guarantee shall be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness
guaranteed (without regard to security interest);

(10) the accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest
on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on
Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to
be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in
each such case, that the amount thereof is included in Fixed Charges of the Issuer as accrued;

(11) obligations in respect of performance and surety bonds and completion guarantees or similar
obligations provided by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer in each case in the normal course of
business (whether or not consistent with past practice);

(12) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Acquired Debt; provided, however,
that on the date of acquisition and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio of the Issuer (A) would be at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would be equal to or greater than such Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such acquisition;

(13) the incurrence by any Foreign Subsidiary of Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (13), not to exceed the greater of (x) $675.0 million or (y) 2.5% of
Consolidated Total Assets;

(14) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred in connection with or in contemplation
of, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the acquisition by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer of property used or useful in a Permitted Business (whether
through the direct purchase of assets or the purchase of Capital Stock of, or merger or consolidation with, any
Person owning such assets); provided, however, on the date of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto on
a pro forma basis, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer (A) would be at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would be
equal to or greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such incurrence;

(15) Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries constituting reimbursement
obligations with respect to letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business, including letters of credit in
respect of workers’ compensation claims, death, disability or other employee benefits or property, casualty or
liability insurance or self-insurance, or other Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement-type obligations
regarding workers’ compensation claims; provided, however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or
the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing or
incurrence;

(16) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or
similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds, provided that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five
business days of notice of its incurrence;

(17) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries supported by a letter of credit issued
pursuant to the Credit Facilities, in a principal amount not in excess of the stated amount of such letter of credit;

(18) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries consisting of (i) the financing of
insurance premiums or (ii) take-or-pay or similar obligations contained in supply arrangements, in each case,
incurred in the ordinary course of business;

76


-----

(19) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this
clause (19), not to exceed the greater of (x) $675.0 million and (y) 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets; and

(20) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness secured by a Lien
under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount such that, on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma
application of the proceeds therefrom), the Secured Leverage Ratio would not exceed 3.50 to 1.00.

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Note Guarantor to, incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted
Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Note
Guarantors unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the notes on
substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Note Guarantors will
be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Note Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or having a junior lien priority.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock” covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the
categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (20) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date
of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies
with this covenant. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement
outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception
provided by clause (20) of the definition of Permitted Debt.

In addition, for purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock” covenant, the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may elect to treat all or any portion
of the commitment under any Indebtedness (including with respect to any revolving loan commitment) as being
incurred at the time of such commitment, in which case any subsequent incurrence of Indebtedness under such
commitment shall not be deemed to be an incurrence at such subsequent time.

**Liens**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except a Permitted Lien) of any kind (any such Lien, the “Initial Lien”)
on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired; except, in the case of any assets that do not constitute Collateral,
any Initial Lien if the notes or the Note Guarantees are secured equally and ratably with (or prior to) the
obligations secured by such Initial Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of holders pursuant to the last clause of the preceding paragraph shall
provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without
any action on the part of the holders, upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.

**Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any such
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or pay any indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

77


-----

(2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by
reason of:

(1) agreements, including agreements governing Existing Indebtedness, as in effect on the date of the
indenture and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements,
renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer, not more materially restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment
restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the date of the indenture;

(2) the indenture, the notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral Documents;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Credit Facilities incurred under clause (1) or (20) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock”;

(4) applicable law, rule, regulation or order, approval, license, permit or similar restriction, including under
contracts with foreign governments or agencies thereof entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(5) any instrument governing Indebtedness, Capital Stock or assets of a Person acquired by the Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness
was incurred, or such Capital Stock was issued, in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition),
which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other
than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired, and any amendments, modifications,
restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements
provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not materially more restrictive, taken
as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those agreements
on the date of the acquisition; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the
terms of the indenture to be incurred;

(6) customary non-assignment provisions in leases, contracts and licenses entered into in the ordinary course
of business;

(7) purchase money obligations for property that impose restrictions on that property of the nature described
in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

(8) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions,
transfers, loans or advances by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(9) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements
governing such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, materially
more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being
refinanced;

(10) Permitted Liens securing Indebtedness that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject
to such Liens;

78


-----

(11) customary provisions in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale agreements and
other similar agreements entered into with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or otherwise in the
ordinary course of business;

(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in
the ordinary course of business;

(13) restrictions in agreements or instruments which prohibit the payment or making of dividends or other
distributions other than on a pro rata basis;

(14) contractual requirements of a Securitization Special Purpose Entity in connection with a Qualified
Securitization Transaction; provided that such restrictions apply only to such Securitization Special Purpose
Entity; and

(15) any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness or preferred stock permitted to be incurred
subsequent to the issue date pursuant to the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Preferred Stock,” which encumbrances or restrictions (i) are not, in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer, materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the indenture or (ii) will not, in the
good faith judgment of the Issuer, affect the ability of the Issuer to make anticipated payments of principal,
interest or premium on the notes.

**Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets**

The Issuer may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate, amalgamate, or merge with or into another Person
(whether or not the Issuer is the surviving corporation); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
in one or more related transactions, to another Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) the Issuer is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, amalgamation, or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition has been made is organized and validly existing under the laws of the U.S., any
state of the U.S. or the District of Columbia or under the laws of Canada or any province thereof, any member
state of the European Union as in effect on the Issue Date, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, any Channel Island or
Switzerland (provided that if such entity is not a corporation, a co-obligor of the notes is a corporation);

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, or merger (if other than the
Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made
expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the notes, the indenture and the Collateral Documents
pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(4) either (a) the Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation, or
merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has
been made will, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to
incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the
first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock”, or (b) the Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation amalgamation, or
merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has
been made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have a Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries that would be equal to or greater than such
ratio for such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such action.

79


-----

In addition, the Issuer may not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets,
in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.

The Issuer will not permit any Note Guarantor to, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate, amalgamate, or
merge with or into another Person; or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose (collectively
“dispose”) of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to another
Person unless:

(1) except in the case of a Note Guarantor (x) that has disposed of all or substantially all of its assets,
whether through a merger, amalgamation, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets or (y) that, as a result
of the disposition of all or a portion of its Capital Stock, ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Issuer, in both cases in
compliance with the covenant described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not such Note Guarantor) shall expressly assume, by a guarantee
agreement and Collateral Documents in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of such
Note Guarantor under its Note Guarantee; and

(2) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists.

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or amalgamate with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or any Note Guarantor and (B) the Issuer may
merge or amalgamate with an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in
another jurisdiction within the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, Canada or
any province thereof, any member state of the European Union as in effect on the Issue Date, Bermuda, Cayman
Islands, any Channel Island, Singapore or Switzerland or converting the Issuer into a limited liability company
organized under the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, Canada or any
province thereof, any member state of the European Union as in effect on the Issue Date, Bermuda, Cayman
Islands, any Channel Island, Singapore or Switzerland (provided that a co-obligor of the notes is a corporation).

**Transactions with Affiliates**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from,
or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee
with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or
consideration in excess of $100.0 million, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person, as determined by the Issuer in good faith; and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
consideration in excess of $750.0 million, such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the
disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

The following items will be deemed not to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the
provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any employment agreement or benefit or similar plan entered into by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) transactions between or among the Issuer and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

80


-----

(3) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because the Issuer owns, directly or
through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;

(4) the payment of reasonable compensation and fees to, and the provision of customary indemnities to,
current or former officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) issuances or sales of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to Affiliates or
employees of or consultants to the Issuer;

(6) Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the indenture described above under the
caption “—Restricted Payments” and Permitted Investments;

(7) transactions effected pursuant to agreements in effect on the date of the indenture and any amendment,
modification or replacement to such agreement (so long the as amendment, modification or replacement is not, in
the good faith judgment of the Issuer, materially more disadvantageous to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, taken as a whole, than the terms of those agreements in effect on the date of the indenture);

(8) [Reserved];

(9) transactions with a Permitted Joint Venture in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary holds or
acquires an ownership interest (whether by way of Capital Stock or otherwise) so long as the terms of any such
transactions, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary than they are to other joint venture partners;

(10) any agreement that grants registration and other customary rights in connection therewith or otherwise
to the direct or indirect securityholders of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and the performance of such
agreements);

(11) transactions with Affiliates solely in their capacity as holders of Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, where such Affiliates receive the same consideration as non-Affiliates
in such transactions;

(12) transactions affected as part of a Qualified Securitization Transaction; and

(13) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee
a copy of a letter from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing addressed to the
Company stating that such transaction meets the requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph.

**Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Initially, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are “Restricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be
subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the indenture and will not Guarantee the notes. Following the Issue
Date, the Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Valeant) to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. Any designation of a Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be a designation of each of such entity’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries. Following the Issue Date, if a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in
the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time
of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described
above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” or under one or more of the clauses of the definition of
Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment

81


-----

would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. The Issuer’s Board of Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default; provided that such redesignation will be deemed to be
an incurrence of Indebtedness and, if applicable, an incurrence of related Liens by a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer of any outstanding Indebtedness and, if applicable, related Liens of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such
redesignation will only be permitted if such Indebtedness and, if applicable, related Liens are permitted under the
covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock” and, if applicable, “—Certain Covenants—Liens” (other than clause (3) under the definition of
Permitted Liens), calculated, if applicable, on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the
beginning of the four-quarter reference period.

**Business Activities**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other
than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**Reports**

Whether or not required by the SEC’s rules and regulations, so long as any notes are outstanding, the Issuer
will furnish (to the extent not publicly available on the SEC’s EDGAR system) to the holders of notes and post
on the Issuer’s website (in a format that is accessible to holders of notes as well as prospective holders of notes),
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations:

(1) all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K
if the Issuer were required to file such reports; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Issuer were
required to file such reports.

All such reports will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and regulations
applicable to such reports (other than consolidating financial information required by Rule 3-10 or 3-16 of
Regulation S-X or any comparable provision so long as the Issuer complies with the second to last paragraph of
this “—Reports” covenant). Each annual report on Form 10-K will include a report on the Issuer’s consolidated
financial statements by the Issuer’s independent registered public accountants. In addition, the Issuer will file a
copy of each of the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above with the SEC for public availability within the
time periods specified in the rules and regulations applicable to such reports (unless the SEC will not accept such
a filing or the Issuer is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any
reason) and make such information available to securities analysts and prospective investors upon request.

If, at any time, the Issuer is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for
any reason, and regardless of whether it continues to file reports with the SEC, the Issuer will nevertheless
continue making the reports specified in the preceding paragraph available to the holders of notes, prospective
investors and securities analysts by posting such information on its website.

While the Issuer remains subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Issuer
agrees that it will not take any action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept any such filings. If,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept the Issuer’s filings for any reason, the Issuer will post the
reports referred to in the preceding paragraph on its website within the time periods that would apply if the Issuer
were required to file those reports with the SEC.

In addition, the Issuer agrees that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding, at any time it is not required
to file the reports required by the preceding paragraphs with the SEC, it will furnish to the holders and to

82


-----

securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraphs will include a
reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements, in the footnotes of the financial
statements or in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that
discloses the total assets, liabilities, revenues and income from operations of subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not
Guarantee the notes.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the Issuer fails to comply with its
obligation to file or provide such information, documents and reports as required hereunder, the Issuer will be
deemed to have cured such Default with respect to the notes for purposes of clause (4) under “—Events of
Default and Remedies” upon the filing or provision of all such information, documents and reports required
hereunder prior to the expiration of 90 days after written notice to the Issuer of such failure from the Trustee or
the holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of the notes.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an Event of Default with respect to the notes:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the notes;

(2) default in the payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if any, on the notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (a) to comply with the provisions described
under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”, which failure remains uncured for 30 days after
written notice to the Issuer from the Trustee or to the Issuer and the Trustee from the holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the notes, or (b) to comply with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(4) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days (or 90 days in the case of the
provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports”) after written notice to the Issuer from the Trustee
or to the Issuer and the Trustee from the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the notes to comply with
any of the other agreements in the indenture or the Collateral Documents;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether
such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists or is created after the date of the indenture, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal when due on such Indebtedness within any applicable grace
period provided in such Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity; and, in each case, the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates $250.0 million or more;

(6) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final non-appealable judgments
aggregating in excess of $250.0 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged, stayed or subject to insurance
for a period of 60 days after becoming final;

(7) any Note Guarantee by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect in all material
respects (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Note Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary

83


-----

denies or disaffirms such Note Guarantor’s obligations under the indenture or any Note Guarantee and such
Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice as specified in the indenture;

(8) unless such Liens have been released in accordance with the provisions of the Collateral Documents,
liens with respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral cease to be valid or enforceable, or the Issuer shall
assert or any Note Guarantor shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any such
security interests are invalid or unenforceable and, in the case of any such Note Guarantor, the Issuer fails to
cause such Note Guarantor to rescind such assertions within 30 days after the Issuer has actual knowledge of
such assertions; or

(9) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation described in the indenture with respect to the
Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
when taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the
Issuer, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other
Event of Default with respect to the notes occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately.

Holders of the notes may not enforce the indenture or the notes except as provided in the indenture. Subject to
certain limitations, including the right to be indemnified, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding notes may direct the Trustee with respect to the notes in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee
may withhold from holders of the notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or
Event of Default in the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by written notice to
the Trustee may on behalf of the holders of all of the notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences under the indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on,
or the principal of, the notes.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the
Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**Foreign Currency Equivalents**

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction or amount, the U.S.
dollar equivalent principal amount of any amount denominated in a foreign currency will be the Dollar
Equivalent calculated on the date the Indebtedness was incurred or other transaction was entered into; provided
that if any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars is incurred to
refinance Indebtedness denominated in the same currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness shall be deemed not to exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision in the indenture, no restriction or amount will be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. In no event, will the Trustee or the Paying
Agent be responsible for obtaining exchange rates or otherwise effecting currency conversions or calculations.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Issuer and the Note Guarantors domiciled outside the U.S. have irrevocably appointed Valeant
Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, 400 Somerset Corporate Boulevard, Bridgewater, New Jersey 08807, as
their agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the indenture, the notes, the

84


-----

Note Guarantees and the Collateral Documents brought in any Federal or state court located in New York City
and each of such parties will submit to the jurisdiction thereof.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor, as such, will
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Note Guarantor under the notes, the indenture, the
Collateral Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each holder of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of
the consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its and the Note Guarantors’ obligations
discharged with respect to the outstanding notes and the related Note Guarantees and have Liens on the Collateral
securing the notes released (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or
premium, if any, on, the notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of
notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in connection
therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Note Guarantors with respect to the notes released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the
indenture and have Liens on the Collateral securing the notes released (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter
any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default with respect to the notes or an Event
of Default. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment or bankruptcy or
insolvency events with respect to the Issuer) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer
constitute an Event of Default with respect to the notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as to the notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the notes,
cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars
and U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, in each case in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion
of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest and
premium, if any, on, the outstanding notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the
case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular
redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of the indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal
income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the
beneficial owners of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes

85


-----

as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the outstanding notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) in the case of Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee either
(i) an opinion of counsel in Canada reasonably acceptable to the Trustee, to the effect that, based upon Canadian
law then in effect and having regard to any applicable proposed amendments thereto which have been publicly
announced prior to the date of such defeasance, the beneficial owners of the outstanding notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for Canadian federal, provincial or territorial or other tax purposes, as a result of Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, and will be subject to Canadian taxes on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same time as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, had not occurred or (ii) a ruling directed to the Trustee received from
tax authorities of Canada to the same effect as the opinion of counsel described in clause (i) above;

(5) no Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes may have occurred and be continuing, on the
date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied
to such deposit);

(6) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance must not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute
a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the indenture) to which the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is bound; and

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that
all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs with respect to the notes, (a) the indenture, the
notes and the Collateral Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least
a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes), and (b) any existing Default or
compliance with any provision of the indenture or the notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the notes).

Without the consent of each holder of the notes affected thereby, an amendment or waiver may not (with
respect to any notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of the notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or
waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the provisions with respect to the
redemption of the notes (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, provisions relating to the covenants described
above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any note;

(4) make any such note payable in money other than U.S. dollars;

86


-----

(5) make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of
holders of notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on notes;

(6) waive a redemption payment with respect to any note (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, a payment
required by one of the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(7) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to the notes;

(8) modify the Note Guarantees with respect to the notes in any manner adverse to the holders of the notes;
or

(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

In addition, without the consent of holders of at least 66 2/3% in principal amount of the notes then
outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, notes), (i) except as set forth under “—Note Guarantees,” no amendment or supplement may
release the Note Guarantees with respect to the notes and (ii) no amendment or supplement may modify any
Collateral Documents or the provisions in the indenture dealing with Collateral or the Collateral Documents to
the extent that such amendment or supplement would have the effect of releasing all or substantially all of the
Liens securing the notes (except as permitted by the terms of the indenture and the Collateral Documents) or
change or alter the priority of the security interests in the Collateral.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and the
collateral agents (as applicable) may amend or supplement the indenture, the notes or the Collateral Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Note Guarantor’s obligations to holders of notes in
the case of a consolidation or merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or a Note Guarantor’s assets;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of notes or that
does not adversely affect the legal rights under the indenture of any such holder;

(5) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the indenture
under the TIA;

(6) to conform the text of the indenture, the notes, the Note Guarantees or the Collateral Documents to any
provision of the “Description of the Notes” in the offering memorandum for the initial secured notes;

(7) to provide for the issuance of additional notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the
indenture as of its date;

(8) to add additional Note Guarantees with respect to the notes or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination or discharge of any Note Guarantee with respect to the notes when such release, termination or
discharge is permitted under the indenture;

(9) to secure the notes or the Note Guarantees or to add additional assets as Collateral; or

(10) to release Collateral from the Lien pursuant to the Indenture, the Collateral Documents and the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement when permitted or required by the Indenture, the Collateral Documents or the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

87


-----

In addition, the Issuer, the trustee and the Collateral Agents may amend the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement and the Collateral Documents to provide for the addition of any creditors to such agreements to the
extent a pari passu lien for the benefit of such creditor is permitted by the terms of the indenture and may enter
into an intercreditor agreement with creditors for whom a junior lien on the Collateral is to be granted, provided
the Issuer delivers an officers’ certificate to the Trustee and Collateral Agent certifying that the terms thereof are
customary and that the Trustee and Collateral Agent are authorized to enter into an intercreditor agreement. Upon
delivery of the aforementioned officers’ certificate, the Trustee and Collateral Agent may request an opinion of
counsel stating that they are authorized to enter into an intercreditor agreement.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect, and the Note Guarantees and the
Liens on the Collateral securing the notes will be released without any further action by holders, when:

(1) either:

(a) all notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed notes that have been replaced
or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer,
have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable
by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one
year and the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in
trust solely for the benefit of the holders of notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable U.S. dollar-denominated
Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable U.S. dollar-denominated
Government Securities, in each case in amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any
reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the notes not delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or
redemption, provided that with respect to any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purpose of the indenture to the extent that an amount
is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any Applicable Premium deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior
to the date of redemption;

(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the notes on the date of the
deposit or will occur as a result of the deposit and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer is bound, and
as to which the rights of the other parties thereto are senior to those of the holders;

(3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it with respect to the notes under the
indenture; and

(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer, the indenture limits its right to obtain payment of claims in
certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The
Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

88


-----

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes will have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee with
respect to the notes, subject to certain exceptions. The indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent
person in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture at the request of any holder of notes, unless
such holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any
loss, liability or expense (including attorney’s fees and expenses).

The Trustee shall not be responsible to make any calculation with respect to any matter under the indenture.

**Governing Law**

The indenture, the notes, the guarantees and the Collateral Documents are governed by the laws of the State
of New York; provided that certain of the Collateral Documents are governed by the laws of other jurisdictions to
the extent that (i) the validity, perfection, effect of perfection or of non-perfection or priority of the security
interests granted thereunder are governed by such other jurisdictions pursuant to applicable conflict of laws
principles or (ii) such approach is consistent with the security interests granted with respect to the Credit
Agreement or with applicable commercial practice.

**Additional Information**

Anyone who receives this offering memorandum may obtain a copy of the indenture without charge by
writing to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., 400 Somerset Corporate Boulevard, Bridgewater, NJ
08807, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

**Book-Entry, Delivery and Form**

The notes will be represented by one or more notes in registered global form, without interest coupons
attached. On the date of closing, these global notes (the “Global Notes”) will remain in the custody of the Trustee
and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect
participant in DTC as described below.

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another
nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants,
including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream, which may change from time to time. Beneficial
interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for notes in certificated form except in the limited
circumstances described below. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes”.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these operations
and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its
participating organizations (collectively, the “participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions in those securities between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its

89


-----

participants. The participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations
and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either
directly or indirectly (collectively, the “indirect participants”). Persons who are not participants may beneficially
own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the participants or the indirect participants. The
ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are
recorded on the records of the participants and indirect participants.

DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of participants with portions of the
principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these
interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the participants) or by the
participants and the indirect participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Global Notes who are participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly
through DTC. Investors in the Global Notes who are not participants may hold their interests therein indirectly
through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are participants in such system. Euroclear
and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear
Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held
through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC.

Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and
requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in
definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global
Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of participants, which in
turn act on behalf of indirect participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to
pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered
owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture.
Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes,
including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and
for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has
or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to or payments
made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any of DTC’s records or any participant’s or indirect participant’s records relating to the beneficial
ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its participants or indirect
participants.

DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities
such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant participants with the

90


-----

payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment
date. Each relevant participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest
in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the participants
and the indirect participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and
customary practices and will be the responsibility of the participants or the indirect participants and will not be
the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay
by DTC or any of its participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee
may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all
purposes.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be
settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in
accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Cross-market transfers between the participants in DTC, on the one hand, and DTC participants acting on
behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance
with DTC’s rules on behalf of DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be;
however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the
established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the
transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the DTC participant acting on its behalf to
take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note
in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement
applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to
the DTC participants acting on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and
only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default, DTC reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its participants.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation
to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither
the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for definitive notes in registered certificated form, or “Certificated Notes,”
if:

(1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or
(b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, the Issuer fails to
appoint a successor depositary; or

(2) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default.

In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global
Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures), and the Certificated Notes shall bear appropriate
legends indicating the transfer restrictions applicable thereto.

91


-----

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

The Issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
Global Note holder. The Issuer will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to
Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the
Certificated Notes, in the case of a holder holding an aggregate principal amount of notes of $1.0 million or
more, or, if no such account is specified or in the case of a holder holding an aggregate principal amount of notes
of less than $1.0 million, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The notes represented by
the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any
permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in
immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes will also be
settled in immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of
DTC. DTC has advised the Issuer that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in
a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with
value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account
only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**Certain Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the indenture. Reference is made to the indenture for a full

becoming a Subsidiary of, such specified Person; and

(2) Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such specified Person.

“Affiliate” of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by

and deliver certain certificates and opinions in respect thereof, all as and to the extent required by the indenture,
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the Collateral Documents; provided that, while any obligations under
the Credit Agreement are outstanding, After-Acquired Property shall only be Collateral that is pledged to secure
the obligations under the Credit Agreement (including property of a Person that becomes a new Note Guarantor)

92


-----

“Applicable Premium” means, with respect to the notes, the greater of

(1) 1.0% of the then outstanding principal amount of such notes and

(c) accrued interest paid on the date of redemption. The Issuer shall determine the Applicable
Premium.

“Asset Sale” means:

(1) the sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of any assets, property or rights outside of the ordinary

of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole will be governed by the provisions of the indenture
described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and/ or the
provisions described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”
and not by the provisions of the Asset Sale covenant; and

less than $100.0 million;

settlement, release or surrender of contract, tort or other claims; and

(11) sales, transfers or other dispositions of assets for consideration at least equal to the Fair Market Value
of the assets sold or disposed of, but only if the consideration received consists of property or assets (other than
cash, except to the extent used as a bona fide means of equalizing the value of the property or assets involved in
the swap transaction; provided, however, that cash does not exceed 10% of the sum of the amount of the cash and
the Fair Market Value of the assets received or given) of a nature or type that are used in a business having
property or assets of a nature or type or engaged in a Permitted Business (or Capital Stock of a Person whose
assets consist of assets of the type described in this clause (11)).

“Attributable Debt” in respect of a sale and leaseback transaction means, at the time of determination, the
present value of the obligation of the lessee for net rental payments during the remaining term of the lease

the rate of interest implicit in such transaction, determined in accordance with GAAP.

“Beneficial Owner” has the meaning assigned to such term in Rule 13d-3 and Rule 13d-5 under the
Exchange Act, except that in calculating the beneficial ownership of any particular “person” (as that term is used

securities that such “person” has the right to acquire by conversion or exercise of other securities, whether such
right is currently exercisable or is exercisable only after the passage of time. The terms “Beneficially Owns” and
“Beneficially Owned” have a corresponding meaning.

**UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the
ownership and disposition of the notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax
considerations. This discussion is based upon current U.S. federal income tax law, which is subject to change,
possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to a prospective investor in light of its particular circumstances, including
prospective investors subject to special rules (for example, financial institutions, regulated investment
companies, dealers or traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting, investors who will
hold the notes as part of a “straddle” or integrated transaction, U.S. holders (as defined herein) whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar or tax-exempt entities). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who
purchase the notes for cash in this offering at their initial offering price and who hold the notes as capital assets
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes who is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any of
the following:

   - an individual citizen or resident of the U.S.;

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of
the U.S., any state thereof or the District of Columbia; or

   - an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

A “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes who is an individual, corporation, estate or trust
that is not a U.S. holder. Special considerations apply to a nonresident alien individual present in the
United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition or a former citizen or former resident of the
United States and such an individual should consult its tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning or disposing of a note.

If a partnership holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding the notes, you should
consult your tax advisors.

This discussion does not address any other U.S. federal tax consequences (e.g., alternative minimum tax,
Medicare contribution tax or estate or gift tax) or any state, local or foreign tax laws. Each prospective purchaser
of the notes should consult its tax advisor concerning the tax consequences of holding the notes in light of its
particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed
below, as well as the application of state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws..

**Certain Additional Payments**

There are circumstances in which we might be required to make payments on a note that would increase the
yield of the note, as described under “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change
of Control”. We intend to take the position that the possibility of such payments does not result in the notes being
treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. If the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) takes a contrary position, a holder subject to U.S. federal income tax may be required to
accrue interest income based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury Regulations) determined at
the time of issuance of the notes (which is not expected to differ significantly from the actual yield on the notes),
with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from the payments based
on the comparable yield.

In addition, any income on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes would be
treated as interest income rather than as capital gain. A holder subject to U.S. federal income tax should consult

113


-----

its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences if the notes were treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. This discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to U.S. holders.

**Qualified Reopening**

It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the new secured notes will be issued in a “qualified
reopening” of the initial secured notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the new secured notes
will be considered to have the same issue date and issue price as the initial secured notes and will be fungible
with the initial secured notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the U.S. holder’s
purchase price, the new secured notes may have bond premium (as discussed below under “—Amortizable Bond
Premium”).

**Payments of Interest**

Subject to the discussion below regarding pre-acquisition accrued interest and amortizable bond premium,
interest on the notes, including any Additional Amounts, (without reduction for any applicable withholding tax)
will generally be subject to tax as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with the U.S.
holder’s method of accounting for tax purposes. It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will be
issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder may be entitled to deduct or credit withholding tax, if any, subject to certain limitations
(including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of such holder’s foreign taxes for a
particular tax year). Interest income on the notes (including any Additional Amounts) will generally be
considered foreign source income and will generally be characterized as “passive category income” for purposes
of computing the foreign tax credits allowable to a U.S. holder. A U.S. holder will generally be denied a foreign
tax credit for any taxes imposed with respect to the notes if the holder does not meet a minimum holding period
during which such holder is not protected from risk of loss. As an alternative to the tax credit, a U.S. holder may
elect to deduct such taxes (the election would then apply to all foreign income taxes such U.S. holder paid in that
taxable year). Each U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the availability of the foreign tax
credit under its particular circumstances.

**Pre-acquisition Accrued Interest**

A portion of the price paid for the new secured notes offered hereby will be allocable to interest that accrued
prior to the date the note is purchased (the “pre-acquisition accrued interest”). You may take the position that, on
the first interest payment date, a portion of the interest received in an amount equal to the pre-acquisition accrued
interest should be treated as a return of the pre-acquisition accrued interest and not as a payment of interest on the
note. Amounts treated as a return of pre-acquisition accrued interest should not be taxable when received.

**Amortizable Bond Premium**

If a U.S. holder purchases a new secured note for an amount (not including any amount paid for
pre-acquisition accrued interest) that is greater than the principal amount of the note, such holder will be
considered to have purchased the note with amortizable bond premium. In general, a U.S. holder may elect to
amortize this premium, using a constant-yield method, over the remaining term of the note. A U.S. holder may
generally use the amortizable bond premium allocable to an accrual period to offset interest required to be
included in income with respect to the note in that accrual period. However, because the notes may be redeemed

114


-----

by us prior to maturity at a premium, special rules apply that may reduce, eliminate or defer the amount of bond
premium that a U.S. holder may amortize with respect to the notes. If a U.S. holder elects to amortize bond
premium with respect to a note, such holder must reduce its tax basis in the note by the amount of the premium
amortized in any year. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations then owned
and thereafter acquired and may be revoked only with the consent of the IRS.

**Sale, Exchange and Retirement of Notes**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note a U.S. holder will recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition and the adjusted tax basis of the note. The adjusted tax basis of a note to a U.S. holder will
generally be the cost of such note to the U.S. holder (excluding pre-acquisition accrued interest), reduced by any
bond premium previously amortized. For these purposes, the amount realized does not include any amount
attributable to accrued and unpaid interest (including pre-acquisition accrued interest), which will be subject to
tax as interest income as described above under “—Payments of Interest” and “—Pre-acquisition Accrued
Interest.”

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note will be
capital gain or loss and will generally be treated as U.S. source gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S.
holders derived in respect of capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Additional Reporting Requirements**

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in a note, subject to certain
exceptions (including an exception for notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these rules on their ownership and
disposition of the notes.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on payments of
interest on a note or gain on the sale of a note, unless such non-U.S. holder held the note in connection with a
U.S. trade or business carried on by such non-U.S. holder (and, if a treaty applies, such item is attributable to the
conduct of a trade or business through a permanent establishment or fixed base in the U.S.).

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Both U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders may be subject to information reporting. The IRS may make this
information available under the tax provisions of the applicable income tax treaty or agreement to foreign tax
authorities. A U.S. holder may also be subject to backup withholding on payments in respect of its notes unless it
provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies
with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to
backup withholding if it timely provides a properly completed IRS Form W-8 appropriate to its circumstances.

**CERTAIN CANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following summary describes the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations generally
applicable, as of the date hereof, to a purchaser who acquires, as beneficial owner, new secured notes, including
entitlement to all payments (including any interest and principal) thereunder, pursuant to this offering
memorandum and who, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and the regulations thereunder
(collectively, the “Tax Act”) and at all relevant times, deals at arm’s length with the Issuer, each Note Guarantor
and each of the Initial Purchasers (a “holder”).

This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Tax Act, and the Issuer’s Canadian legal counsel’s
understanding of the current administrative practices and assessing policies of the Canada Revenue Agency
published in writing by it prior to the date hereof. This summary takes into account all specific proposals to
amend the Tax Act publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date
hereof (the “Tax Proposals”) and assumes that all Tax Proposals will be enacted in the form proposed. However,
no assurances can be given that the Tax Proposals will be enacted as proposed, or at all. This summary does not
otherwise take into account or anticipate any changes in law or administrative practices or assessing policies,
whether by legislative, regulatory, administrative or judicial decision or action, nor does it take into account other
federal, provincial, territorial or foreign tax considerations which may differ from those discussed herein.

This summary is of a general nature only and is not, and is not intended to be, legal or tax advice to any
particular holder. This summary is not exhaustive of all federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to
a particular holder. Accordingly, prospective purchasers of notes should consult their own tax advisors with
respect to their particular circumstances.

**Canadian Resident Holders**

The following portion of this summary is generally applicable only to a holder who, at all relevant times, for
purposes of the Tax Act, is or is deemed to be a resident of Canada, is not affiliated with the Issuer, any Note
Guarantor or any Initial Purchaser and holds the new secured notes as capital property (a “Canadian Resident
Holder”). Generally, the new secured notes will be capital property to a holder provided the holder does not use
or hold the new secured notes in the course of carrying on a business and has not acquired or held them as part of
an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. A Canadian Resident Holder whose new secured notes might not
otherwise qualify as capital property may be entitled to make an irrevocable election in accordance with
subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act to have the new secured notes and every “Canadian security” (as defined in the
Tax Act) owned by such Canadian Resident Holder in the taxation year of election and all subsequent taxation
years deemed to be capital property.

The following portion of this summary is not applicable to a Canadian Resident Holder (i) an interest in
which is a “tax shelter investment”, as defined in the Tax Act, (ii) that is a “financial institution”, as defined in
the Tax Act for purposes of certain rules in the Tax Act, referred to as the “mark-to-market” rules, (iii) that
reports its “Canadian tax results”, as defined in the Tax Act, in a currency other than Canadian currency or
(iv) that has entered or will enter into a “derivative forward agreement,” as such term is defined in the Tax Act,
in respect of the new secured notes. Any such Canadian Resident Holder should consult its own tax advisors with
respect to the tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the new secured notes.

**Currency Conversion**

The new secured notes are denominated in U.S. dollars. For purposes of the Tax Act, all amounts relating to
the acquisition, holding or disposition of the new secured notes must be converted into Canadian dollars based on
exchange rates determined in accordance with the Tax Act. The amount of interest required to be included in the
income of, and capital gains or capital losses realized by, a Canadian Resident Holder may be affected by
currency fluctuations.

116


-----

**Taxation of Interest and Other Amounts**

A Canadian Resident Holder that is a corporation, partnership, unit trust or trust of which a corporation or
partnership is a beneficiary will be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year all interest on
a new secured note that accrues or is deemed to accrue to such Canadian Resident Holder to the end of that
taxation year, or that becomes receivable or is received by such Canadian Resident Holder before the end of that
taxation year, to the extent that such amount was not otherwise included in computing the Canadian Resident
Holder’s income for a preceding taxation year.

Any other Canadian Resident Holder, including an individual or a trust (other than a trust described in the
preceding paragraph), will be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year any interest that is
received or receivable in respect of a new secured note by such Canadian Resident Holder in that taxation year
(depending upon the method regularly followed by the Canadian Resident Holder in computing income), to the
extent that such interest was not otherwise included in computing the Canadian Resident Holder’s income for a
preceding taxation year.

In acquiring a new secured note a Canadian Resident Holder will become entitled to an amount stipulated to
be interest in respect of the period from October 17, 2017 to the Closing Date (“pre-issue interest”). The amount
of pre-issue interest will be deductible to the Canadian Resident Holder in the year in which it is included in
computing the income of the Canadian Resident Holder provided that it is reasonable to consider that the
purchase price of the new secured note paid by the initial purchaser of the note to the Issuer included an amount
in respect of pre-issue interest. The adjusted cost base to the Canadian Resident Holder in respect of the new
secured note will be reduced by the amount of the pre-issue interest which is so deductible.

Any amount paid by the Issuer to a Canadian Resident Holder as a penalty or bonus because of the
redemption or repurchase by it of a new secured note before the maturity thereof will be deemed to be interest
received on the note by the Canadian Resident Holder at the time of payment to the extent that such amount can
reasonably be considered to relate to, and does not exceed the value at the time of redemption or repurchase of,
the interest that would have been paid or payable by the Issuer on the note for a taxation year of the Issuer ending
after the redemption or repurchase. Such interest will be required to be included in computing the Canadian
Resident Holder’s income in the manner described above.

**Dispositions**

On a disposition or a deemed disposition of a new secured note, including a repurchase or redemption by the
Issuer prior to maturity, or a repayment by the Issuer upon maturity, a Canadian Resident Holder generally will
be required to include in computing its income for the taxation year in which the disposition occurs all interest
that has accrued or that is deemed to have accrued on the new secured note from the date of the last interest
payment to the date of disposition, except to the extent that such interest has otherwise been included in the
Canadian Resident Holder’s income for that taxation year or a preceding taxation year.

In addition, the disposition or deemed disposition of a new secured note generally will result in a capital
gain (or a capital loss) equal to the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition, net of any amount
included in the Canadian Resident Holder’s income as interest and any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or
are less than) the adjusted cost base of the note to the Canadian Resident Holder immediately before the
disposition. In computing the adjusted cost base of any new secured note acquired by a Canadian Resident
Holder pursuant to this offering memorandum, the Canadian Resident Holder will generally be required to
average the cost of the new secured note with the adjusted cost base of all initial secured notes owned by the
Canadian Resident Holder as capital property at that time, if any.

Generally, a Canadian Resident Holder is required to include in computing its income for a taxation year
one-half of the amount of any such capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”). Subject to and in accordance with the

117


-----

provisions of the Tax Act, a Canadian Resident Holder is required to deduct one-half of the amount of any such
capital loss (an “allowable capital loss”) realized in a taxation year from taxable capital gains realized by the
Canadian Resident Holder in the year and allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains may be
carried back and deducted in any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward and deducted in any
subsequent taxation year against net taxable capital gains realized in such years. A capital gain realized by an
individual or by most trusts may give rise to liability for alternative minimum tax.

**Additional Refundable Tax**

A Canadian Resident Holder that is throughout the year a “Canadian-controlled private corporation” (as
defined in the Tax Act) may be liable to pay an additional refundable tax on certain investment income, including
interest and taxable capital gains earned or received in respect of the new secured notes.

**Non-Canadian Resident Holders**

The following portion of this summary is generally applicable to a holder who, at all relevant times, for
purposes of the Tax Act, (i) is not, and is not deemed to be, a resident of Canada, (ii) does not use or hold and is
not deemed to use or hold the new secured notes in the course of a business carried on or deemed to be carried on
in Canada, (iii) deals at arm’s length with any transferee resident or deemed resident in Canada to whom the
holder disposes of notes and (iv) is not a “specified shareholder” (as defined in subsection 18(5) of the Tax Act)
of the Issuer or a person not dealing at arm’s length with any such “specified shareholder” of the Issuer (a
“Non-Canadian Resident Holder”). A specified shareholder for these purposes generally includes a person who
(either alone or together with persons with whom that person is not dealing at arm’s length for purposes of the
Tax Act) owns or has the right to acquire or control or is otherwise deemed to own 25% or more of the Issuer’s
shares determined on a votes or fair market value basis. In addition, special rules, which are not discussed in this
summary, may apply to a Non-Canadian Resident Holder that is an insurer that carries on an insurance business
in Canada and elsewhere.

A Non-Canadian Resident Holder will not be subject to Canadian withholding tax in respect of amounts
paid or credited, or deemed to be paid or credited, to the Non-Canadian Resident Holder by the Issuer or any
Note Guarantor as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of interest, premium, bonus or principal
on the new secured notes, including in respect of a redemption, repurchase or payment on maturity.

No other tax on income or gains will be payable by a Non-Canadian Resident Holder on interest, principal,
bonus or premium on the new secured notes or on the proceeds received by Non-Canadian Resident Holder on
the disposition of a new secured note including a redemption, repurchase or payment on maturity.

118


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and they may not be offered or
sold within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or
in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. In addition, the notes have not
been and will not be qualified for sale to the public by prospectus under the securities laws of the Province of
Quebec or any other province or territory of Canada, and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an
exemption from the prospectus requirements of the Securities Act (Quebec) and other applicable provincial
securities laws. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold only (A) to QIBs in compliance with
Rule 144A and (B) outside the U.S. to persons other than U.S. persons (“non-U.S. purchasers”, which term shall
include dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the U.S. acting on a discretionary basis for non-U.S. beneficial
owners (other than an estate or trust)) in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”).

As used herein, the terms “U.S.” and “U.S. person” have the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser or transferee of notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

1. It is purchasing the notes as a principal for its own account or an account with respect to which it
exercises sole investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a QIB, and is aware that the
sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) a non-U.S. purchaser that is outside the U.S. (or a
non-U.S. purchaser that is a dealer or other fiduciary as referred to above).

2. It acknowledges that the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or
qualified for sale to the public by prospectus under the Securities Act (Quebec) or the securities laws of any other
province or territory of Canada (together, “Canadian Securities Laws”) and may not be offered or sold except as
set forth below.

3. It shall not resell or otherwise transfer any of such notes prior to (i) the first anniversary of the last date of
original issuance of the notes (or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144(d) under the Securities
Act) and (ii) such later date, if any, as may be required by applicable laws, except (A) to the Issuer or any of its
subsidiaries, (B) inside the U.S. to a QIB in a transaction complying with Rule 144A, (C) inside the U.S. to
institutional “accredited investors” (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act), that,
prior to such transfer, furnishes (or has furnished on its behalf by a U.S. broker-dealer) to the Trustee a signed
letter containing certain representations and agreements relating to the restrictions on transfer of the notes (the
form of which letter can be obtained from such trustee), (D) outside the U.S. in compliance with Rule 904 under
the Securities Act, (E) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act
(if available), (F) in accordance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
(and based upon an opinion of counsel if the Issuer so requests), or (G) pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act. Further, it shall not resell or otherwise transfer any of such notes except
pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirements of Canadian Securities Laws, or in a transaction that
otherwise complies with or is not subject to the prospectus requirements of Canadian Securities Laws.

4. It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the notes notice of any restrictions on
transfer of such notes.

5. It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of beneficial interests
in a Global Note (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration statement) the holder of notes or the
holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the case may be, may be required to provide certifications and
other documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and submit such certifications and other
documentation as provided in the indenture.

6. It understands that all of the notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect unless otherwise
agreed by the Issuer and the holder thereof:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS

The Initial Purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the new secured notes being offered, if any
are taken. The offering price for the new secured notes is set forth on the cover page of this offering
memorandum. After the new secured notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering
price and other selling terms with respect to the new secured notes. The offering of the new secured notes by the
Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any
order in whole or in part.

The Initial Purchasers will receive customary commissions and discounts under the purchase agreement
upon the consummation of the offering of the new secured notes pursuant to this offering memorandum.

The new secured notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or qualified for
distribution under Canadian Securities Laws. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell
the new secured notes being sold in Canada to “accredited investors” within the meaning of National Instrument
45-106 Prospectus Exemptions (or, in Ontario, Section 73.3 of the Securities Act (Ontario)) who are eligible to
acquire the new secured notes pursuant to an exemption from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian
Securities Laws, and, further, will only offer and sell the new secured notes (A) to persons they reasonably
believe to be QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the U.S. to non-U.S.
persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the
meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In connection with sales outside the U.S., the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or
deliver the new secured notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’
distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the
date the new secured notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell
such new secured notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on
offers and sales of the new secured notes within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, with respect to new secured notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the
later of the commencement of this offering or the date the new secured notes are originally issued, an offer or
sale of such new secured notes within the U.S. by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.

122


-----

One or more of the Initial Purchasers may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of
the notes in jurisdictions in which such Initial Purchasers are not otherwise permitted to make such sales.

The new secured notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer has been
advised by the Initial Purchasers that certain of the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the notes but are
not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given
as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes.

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These
transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short
sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of new secured notes than they are
required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the
purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress.

These activities by the Initial Purchasers, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own
accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the
notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are
commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected
in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Singapore. Accordingly, this offering memorandum or any other document or material in connection with the
offer or sale, or invitation for subscription or purchase, of the notes may not be circulated or distributed, nor may
the notes be offered or sold, or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or purchase, whether directly
or indirectly, to persons in Singapore other than (i) to an institutional investor under Section 274 of the Securities
and Futures Act, Chapter 289 of Singapore (the “SFA”), (ii) to a relevant person pursuant to Section 275(1) of
the SFA, or any person pursuant to Section 275(1A) of the SFA, and in accordance with the conditions, specified

Where the notes are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 of the SFA by a relevant person which is:
(a) a corporation (which is not an accredited investor (as defined in Section 4A of the SFA)) the sole business of
which is to hold investments and the entire share capital of which is owned by one or more individuals, each of
whom is an accredited investor; or (b) a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor) whose sole purpose
is to hold investments and each beneficiary of the trust is an individual who is an accredited investor, securities
(as defined in Section 239(1) of the SFA) of that corporation or the beneficiaries’ rights and interest (howsoever
described) in that trust shall not be transferable within six months after that corporation or that trust has acquired
the notes pursuant to an offer made under Section 275 of the SFA except: (1) to an institutional investor under
Section 274 of the SFA or to a relevant person defined in Section 275(2) of the SFA, or to any person arising

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Japan**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of
Japan (the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law) and each Initial Purchaser has agreed that it will not offer
or sell any notes, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any resident of Japan (which term as
used herein means any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the

124


-----

laws of Japan), or to others for re-offering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to a resident of Japan,
except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of, and otherwise in compliance with, the
Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and any other applicable laws, regulations and ministerial guidelines of
Japan.

We have agreed with Barclays Capital Inc., for 30 days after the Closing Date, not to offer, sell contract to
sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes (other than unsecured notes
issued to refinance existing unsecured notes) without Barclays Capital Inc.’s prior written consent.

We have agreed to indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.

If any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge
and certain other of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent
with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would
hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the new secured notes offered hereby. Any
such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered
hereby.

We expect that delivery of the new secured notes will be made to investors on or about, 2017, which will
be the business day following the date of this offering memorandum. Under Rule 15c6-1 (as amended
effective September 5, 2017) under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two
business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish
to trade notes prior to the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes will
not initially settle in T+2, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a
failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder
should consult their advisors.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investment and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer and
Valeant. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform,
various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services for the Issuer, and its affiliates,
for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, Barclays Bank PLC is the
administrative agent and collateral agent for the Credit Facilities. Also, affiliates of certain of the Initial
Purchasers are lenders and/or agents under the Credit Agreement and may receive a portion of the proceeds from
this offering. In connection with acting as underwriters and/or initial purchasers in various prior transactions for
us, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are named as defendants in litigation relating to those prior
transactions and may seek indemnification from us under the applicable purchase agreement for any liability and
expenses arising from such litigation.

**ANNEX A**
**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

The following is an overview of certain insolvency considerations and limitations on the validity and
enforceability of the guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral in certain jurisdictions outside of the
United States and Canada in which a material portion of the Collateral is located.

**France**

Bausch & Lomb France S.A.S., BCF S.A.S. and Laboratoire Chauvin S.A.S., Guarantors of the Notes (the
“French Guarantors”), are incorporated under the laws of France and, as such, any insolvency proceedings
applicable to the French Guarantors may be governed by French insolvency law.

French courts may also have jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings with respect to other
companies of the group if the conditions provided for under the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on
insolvency proceedings, as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) (if applicable) are met, or, if not
applicable, in accordance with traditional French private international law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in France.

**Grace Periods**

Pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil proceeding involving
the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial position and
the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment dates or payment obligations over a
maximum period of two years. In addition, pursuant to Article 1343-5, if a debtor specifically initiates
proceedings thereunder, French courts may decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred
or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate which is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal
rate) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal. If a court order under Article
1343-5 of the French Civil Code is made, it will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual
interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the court.

When the debtor is subject to conciliation proceeding, these provisions shall be read in combination with
Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, see “—Conciliation Proceedings (Procédure de Conciliation).”

**Insolvency—Cessation des Paiements**

Under French law, a company is deemed insolvent (in cessation des paiements) when it is not able to pay its
debts as they fall due out of its available and liquid assets, taking into account any moratorium which its creditors
may have granted as well as any available liquidity reserves.

The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings (either judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation) within 45 days of becoming insolvent unless it has initiated conciliation proceedings within the same
period. If it does not, directors and, as the case may be, de facto managers, may be subject to civil liability.
Insolvency proceedings may also be initiated upon the initiative of a creditor or of the State prosecutor, provided
that the debtor is insolvent.

**Court-Assisted Proceedings**

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are informal amicable proceedings carried out under the_
supervision of the President of the commercial court. A trustee (as the case may be, a mandataire ad hoc or a

A-1


-----

conciliateur) is appointed confidentially by the President of the commercial court in order to help the debtor
reach an agreement with its creditors in particular by reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. The debtor may
propose, in the filing for the commencement of the proceedings, the appointment of a particular person as trustee.

**Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings (Mandat Ad Hoc)**

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings are confidential proceedings available to solvent debtors. The process is_
voluntary, the legal representative of the company being the only one entitled to file a request with the President
of the commercial court for the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc. A restructuring agreement may be
negotiated between the company and its main creditors on a consensual basis—those creditors not willing to take
part cannot be bound by the arrangement. In the event an agreement is reached, the President of the commercial
court may acknowledge (constater) it but the acknowledged agreement will have no binding effect upon third
parties and will not benefit from any statutory protections. There is no time limit for the duration of mandat ad
_hoc proceedings._

**Conciliation Proceedings (Procédure de Conciliation)**

A company may, in its sole discretion, request the commencement of conciliation proceedings (procédure
_de conciliation) with respect to itself, provided it (i) is not insolvent or has not been insolvent for more than 45_
days, and (ii) experiences legal, economic or financial difficulties. The competent commercial court will appoint
a conciliator (conciliateur) to help the company reach an agreement with its creditors for reducing or
rescheduling its indebtedness. Such agreement may be either confidentially acknowledged (constaté) by the
President of the commercial court (in which case the agreement becomes immediately enforceable (exécutoire))
or approved (homologué) by the commercial court. The main consequences of the approval (homologation) by
the commercial court will be the following:

   - creditors who provide new money or goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the
business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will enjoy a
preferential treatment in the event of subsequent insolvency proceedings; and

   - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of the cessation des paiements, which is the starting date of the “hardening period” preceding the
opening of insolvency proceedings (see below), cannot be fixed by the commercial court as of a date
earlier than the date of the approval of the agreement.

Conciliation proceedings are also confidential, but, in case of approval by the commercial court, third
parties are informed that such an agreement has been entered into, through a publication. Conciliation
proceedings may last up to five months.

If a creditor seeks payment during conciliation proceedings, then pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French
Commercial Code, the judge having opened the conciliation proceedings has jurisdiction to grant a grace period
to the debtor, in accordance with article 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code, provided that the debtor has
received a formal notice requesting payment or faces enforcement measures, in which case the decision would be
taken after having heard the conciliator. This judge also has jurisdiction to grant such a grace period during the
implementation of the conciliation agreement (i.e., after the end of the conciliation proceedings), in relation to
claims of non-consenting creditors (other than public creditors), provided that this agreement has been either
recognized or sanctioned by a court decision, as discussed below.

Conciliation proceedings may also be the first step of:

   - Either a so-called “prepack” sale of business to be implemented in subsequent judicial reorganization or
judicial liquidation proceedings. Potential purchasers of the business are sought during the conciliation
proceedings, and the sale of the company’s business is then implemented very quickly after the opening
of insolvency proceedings; or

A-2


-----

   - Accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, see “—Safeguard Proceedings
(Procédure de Sauvegarde)” and “—Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde
Accélérée).”

**Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde)**

The safeguard proceedings allows for the establishment of a restructuring plan under commercial court
supervision before the company becomes insolvent. It is available only at the request of a debtor company. The
objectives of safeguard proceedings are, in order of priority, to safeguard the debtor’s activity, to safeguard jobs
and to pay creditors. French insolvency proceedings are safeguard proceedings (including accelerated safeguard
and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings), judicial reorganization proceedings and judicial liquidation.
The debtor must be solvent (i.e., not unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets) but experiencing
difficulties that cannot be overcome. Safeguard proceedings are public and include an automatic stay of all
actions against the debtor for up to six months, renewable for an additional six months with commercial court
approval and which can be extended to a maximum of 18 months upon request of the state prosecutor. During
this period (the “observation period”), the debtor and the insolvency officers try to elaborate a viable
restructuring plan (including a debt restructuring) called the “safeguard plan,” and to have it adopted by the
court.

During the observation period, payments by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the commencement of
the proceedings are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. The supervising judge (juge-commissaire) can
authorize payments for prepetition debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued
operation of the business or get back goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine
_fiduciaire). Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings will be given priority over debts_
incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings if they relate to expenses necessary for the
business’s ordinary activities or are for the requirements of the proceedings.

One of the main features of the safeguard proceedings consists in the creation of two creditors’ committees
(mandatory for companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding €20 million, optional
below such thresholds), one consisting of credit institutions and “assimilated entities” (including not only credit
institutions but also any entity having granted credit facilities to the debtor, and any assignees of such
receivables) and the other of the main trade creditors (creditors whose claim is equal to more than 3% of the
company’s total debt to its trade creditors), and a general meeting of noteholders (comprising all holders of all
notes issued by the Company even they relate to different issues and no matter what the applicable law of those
notes is) in the event the relevant debtor has issued bonds, to which the debtor submits a draft safeguard plan.
Any member of the creditors’ committees (but not of the general meeting of noteholders) is also entitled to
submit a draft safeguard plan.

The plan is approved where members of each committee voting in favor of the plan account for at least
two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote. In cases where bonds have been issued by
the relevant French company, the plan, if approved by the committees, is then submitted to the general meeting
of noteholders (majority of two thirds of the outstanding claims of the noteholders expressing a vote). Each
member of a committee or of the general meeting of noteholders must inform the court-appointed administrator
of any agreement subjecting its vote to certain conditions or providing for the total or partial payment of its claim
by a third-party or any subordination agreement. The court-appointed administrator can then modulate the voting
rights of such a creditor, and submit to such creditor the conditions of calculation of its voting rights. In case of
disagreement on this calculation, the creditor or the court-appointed administrator may seize the president of the
court in summary proceedings. Those creditors or bondholders whose repayment terms are not affected by the
draft plan or for which the draft plan provides for a full repayment in cash upon approval of the plan will not take
part in the vote. The committees and the general meeting of noteholders, if any, shall vote on the plan within six
months of the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings (subject to a potential court decision to
postpone this deadline).

A-3


-----

Creditors which are not members of committees and which are not noteholders are consulted on an
individual basis on debt rescheduling, write-offs and/or debt-for-equity swaps. Creditors are deemed to have
accepted the debt rescheduling or write-offs proposals if they fail to respond within 30 days from the receipt of
the debtor’s proposal. However, in respect to debt-for-equity swap proposals, the creditors’ representative must
obtain the agreement of each creditor in writing.

The plan submitted to the committees and the noteholders, if any, may include not only rescheduling of
debts but also cancellation of debts and debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant
shareholder consent). The plan may provide for a different treatment of creditors if their differences of situation
so justify. The plan must “take into account” intercreditor subordination agreements entered into prior to the
opening of the proceedings (which does not mean that the plan must necessarily be totally compliant with such
agreements). Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the general meeting of noteholders, if any, and
subject to verification by the commercial court that creditors’ interests are adequately preserved, the commercial
court can approve the plan, in which case the plan will be binding also on dissenting members of the committees
and on noteholders (if any). For those individual creditors which have not accepted the debtor’s proposals, the
commercial court can reschedule repayment of their claims over a maximum period of 10 years, except for debts
with maturity dates of more than 10 years, in which case the maturity date may remain the same. The commercial
court cannot oblige such creditors to waive part of their claim. The first payment must be made within a year of
the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual installment must be
of at least 5% of the total admitted pre-filing liabilities).

The commercial court can also adopt a safeguard plan in the absence of creditors’ committees (e.g., because
such committees were not created or because they were dissolved following their failure to vote within the
specified period or following their decision to reject the draft plan). In such a case, all creditors are consulted on
an individual basis, as explained above (in particular, with respect to creditors rejecting the debtor’s proposals,
the commercial court can only impose a rescheduling of the repayment of the debts over a maximum period of
10 years, except for debts with maturity dates of more than 10 years, in which case the maturity date may remain
the same).

**Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde Accélérée)**

A company in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) if (i) while not being en cessation des paiements (i.e., being
unable to pay its debts as they fall due out of its available assets) for more than 45 days when it initially
requested the opening of conciliation, it is facing difficulties that it cannot overcome, (ii) it (x) has its accounts
certified by a statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by certified public accountant (expert
_comptable) and has (A) more than 20 employees or (B) a turnover greater than € 3 million excluding any_
applicable taxes or (C) total assets in its balance sheet greater than € 1.5 million or (y) establishes consolidated
financial statements in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code and (iii) it has
prepared, in the context of conciliation proceedings, a draft safeguard plan that aims to protect its operations in
the long run and which is likely to be supported by a sufficiently large majority of the creditors to allow the
adoption of the plan by the creditors’ committees and the noteholders’ general meeting within the duration of the
procedure (i.e., three months from the opening judgment of the accelerated safeguard procedure).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast track” the safeguard proceedings for
large companies. The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings is roughly similar to the regular
safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard proceedings.
Therefore, some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims made by owners
benefiting from retention of title clauses are, for instance, excluded by law.

Trade creditors are involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings. Where accelerated safeguard
proceedings are opened, the credit institutions committee, the trade creditors’ committee and the general meeting

A-4


-----

of noteholders are convened and are required to vote on the proposed accelerated safeguard plan within the
minimum period of 15 days from delivery of the proposed plan (as applicable in safeguard proceedings).

As with traditional safeguard proceedings, the plan adopted in the context of accelerated safeguard
proceedings may notably provide for rescheduling of debts, debt cancellation or debt-for-equity swaps (requiring
the relevant shareholder consent).

The maximum duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months. If, during this period, no
plan is adopted by the required majorities of the creditors’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders, the
commercial court shall terminate the accelerated safeguard proceedings.

**Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings (Procédure de Sauvegarde Financière Accélérée)**

A company in the course of conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée). The regime applicable to accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings is similar to that applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings but it is
designed to “fast-track” safeguard proceedings dealing with purely financial difficulties. The key difference
between accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is that the latter
relate only to debts owed to so-called “financial debts” (i.e., debts towards entities that are eligible members of
the credit institutions’ committee and debts towards noteholders which are eligible members of the general
meeting of noteholders described above), which are subjected to an automatic stay and dealt with under the
safeguard plan. Other classes of creditors, such as suppliers or public creditors, are not affected by the
proceedings. The company therefore continues to trade normally while the proceedings are pending, thus
reducing significantly the impact of such safeguard proceedings on operational companies.

The same conditions mentioned above for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings also apply to a
debtor eligible for accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, provided that the accounts of the debtor offer
evidence that a plan prepared in the context of conciliation proceedings is supported by a large majority of those
financial creditors who will be affected by the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as indicated in the
preceding paragraph), and is likely to be adopted within the duration of the procedure.

The content of the safeguard plan and conditions of its adoption are the same as in accelerated safeguard
proceedings, except that the credit institutions’ committee and the general meeting of noteholders are required to
vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a shortened minimum period of eight days of being notified of the
proposed plan.

The duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings must not exceed one month, unless the
commercial court decides to extend it by one additional month. If, during this period, no plan is adopted by the
required majorities of the financial creditors and noteholders (the same majority rules apply as in committees in
regular safeguard proceedings), the commercial court shall terminate the accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings and may not impose any uniform debt rescheduling on creditors.

**Judicial Reorganization (Procédure de Redressement Judiciaire)**

A judicial reorganization may be initiated with respect to a company incorporated in France (or a foreign
company whose center of main interest is situated in France) if it cannot pay its due debts out of its available
assets (i.e., if it is in cessation des paiements) provided that its financial situation is capable of improving.

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor, the commercial court or the State prosecutor.
The debtor is required to petition for insolvency proceedings within 45 days of becoming in cessation des
_paiements unless it has initiated a conciliation proceedings within the same period. If it does not, directors and, as_
the case may be, de facto managers, may be subject to civil liability.

A-5


-----

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the same as those of safeguard proceedings. Most
of the rules applicable to safeguard proceedings apply to judicial reorganization proceedings. In particular, the
commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings triggers an automatic stay of proceedings against the
debtor during the observation period (subject to the same limited exceptions). As with safeguard proceedings, the
restructuring plan (the “reorganization plan”) may be adopted by two creditors’ committees (mandatory for
companies employing more than 150 persons or with a turnover exceeding € 20 million, optional below such
thresholds), one consisting of credit institutions and “assimilated entities” and the other of the main trade
creditors (creditors whose claim is equal to more than 3% of the company’s total debt to its trade creditors), and a
general meeting of noteholders (comprising all holders of all notes issued by the company even they relate to
different issues and no matter what the applicable law of those notes is).

The reorganization plan can combine all of the following: a debt restructuring, a recapitalization of the
company, a debt-for-equity swap (always with the relevant shareholder approval) and the sale of certain assets or
of portions of the business.

In addition, Law No. 2015-990 dated August 6, 2015 (known as “loi Macron”) has introduced a new
provision (Article L. 631-19-2 of the French Commercial Code) applicable to judicial reorganization proceedings
opened as from August 7, 2015 in the cases where (i) a debtor (a) employs more than 150 employees or
(b) controls one or more companies employing 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of such debtor is likely to
cause serious disturbance to the national or local economy and to local employment, and (iii) a share capital
modification appears, after review of total or partial disposal plan solutions, the only credible solution to avoid
such a disturbance and to allow the debtor’s business activities to continue. In summary, if, in such event, a
reorganization plan provides for a modification of the share capital in favor of one or more person(s) who
undertake to execute the plan (e.g., the new majority shareholders) and the existing shareholders refuse to vote in
favor of such share capital modification, the commercial court may, under certain procedural and substantial
conditions (e.g., the payment to the evicted shareholders of an amount corresponding to the value of their shares,
as determined by a commercial court-appointed expert if no agreement as to such value is reached among the
parties) and upon request of the commercial court-appointed administrator or the State prosecutor, either
(a) appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to vote in favor of a share capital increase in place of the dissenting
shareholders or (b) order, in favor of the person(s) who have undertaken to execute the plan, the transfer of all or
part of the shares owned by the dissenting shareholders who own a majority of voting rights or hold a blocking
minority in the company. Any approval clause included in the company’s constitutional documents is deemed
null and void.

If no reorganization plan is drafted or if the draft reorganization plan appears obviously incapable of
restoring the debtor’s viability, the court may decide to adopt a sale plan (plan de cession), i.e., a plan whereby
all or part of the business is sold to a third party which can cherry-pick the assets, contracts and employees,
without (subject to certain exceptions) the need to obtain the consent of either the debtor, the creditors or the
other party to certain contracts (such as lease-back agreements or supply agreements of goods and services). Any
third party may make a bid to that effect as from the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings. If such a
sale plan is adopted, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated for the repayment of the creditors according to the
ranking of their claims. The sale price is generally significantly lower than the aggregate value of the assets,
bearing in mind that the courts would endorse the most credible offer that would best ensure the preservation of
jobs.

**Judicial Liquidation (Procédure de Liquidation Judiciaire)**

Such proceedings may be initiated by the company, a creditor or the State prosecutor if the debtor is cannot
pay its due debts out of its available assets (i.e., if it is in “cessation des paiement”) and its recovery is not
possible. The aim of these proceedings is to liquidate a company and end its activities, by selling its business,
either as a whole or per branch of activity or asset by asset. The activity is ended from the opening of
proceedings, except if a sale of all or part of the business is feasible. In such a case, the court authorizes the

A-6


-----

company to continue its activity during a maximum period of three months (renewable once) to implement such
a sale.

Liquidation proceedings trigger an automatic stay of proceedings against the company. However, secured
creditors benefiting from a pledge are, where the applicable security arrangements so contemplate, entitled to
enforce their security interest through a court-monitored allocation process (attribution judiciaire) (i.e., request
the court to transfer ownership of the pledged asset(s)). In any case, secured creditors benefiting from a pledge or
a mortgage are entitled to enforce their security interest if the liquidator has not commenced selling the asset
subject to the pledge or mortgage within three months from the judgment opening the liquidation proceedings.

The commercial court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator having
sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes
impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

**Void and Voidable Transactions**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court decision
commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. However, in the decision
commencing judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings or in a subsequent decision, a court may
set the date on which the debtor became insolvent at an earlier date, up to 18 months prior to the court decision
commencing the proceedings. This date is important because it marks the beginning of the “hardening period,”
which lasts until the opening of the insolvency proceedings. Certain transactions entered into by the debtor
during the suspect period are, by law, automatically void or voidable by the court.

Automatically void transactions include in particular transactions or payments entered into during the
hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of
other creditors. Such transactions or payments must be set aside by the court if a claimant (the judicial
administrator, the liquidator, the creditors’ representative or the court-appointed trustee in charge of overseeing
the implementation of the restructuring plan, or the State prosecutor) so requests. These include, notably,
transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor
significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made
in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, security granted for debts previously
incurred, provisional measures (unless the right of attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), share
options granted or sold during the suspect period, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement
(fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as a security for debt incurred at the same time), and any amendment to a
trust arrangement (fiducie) that dedicates assets or rights as a guaranty of pre-existing debts.

Voidable transactions include, (i) transactions for consideration, (ii) payments of due and payable debts or
(iii) notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and
oppositions, in each case, if such actions are taken after the debtor was in cessation des paiements and the party
dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was in cessation des paiements at that time. In addition, transactions
relating to transfers of assets for no consideration are also voidable when carried out during the six-month period
prior to the beginning of the suspect period. Unlike void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so
requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only
“voidable.”

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings, since the condition required to
commence such proceedings is that the company is not insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) within the
meaning of French law.

Article L. 650-1 of the French commercial code also provides that when safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard, judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire)

A-7


-----

proceedings are initiated, creditors cannot be held liable for damages resulting from facilities that they granted,
unless they acted fraudulently or deliberately interfered with the management of the debtor or if security interests
granted to secure such facilities (which may include bonds) were out of proportion with the latter. Case law has
recently set out that this liability would also require that the granting of the facility be deemed to be wrongful. If
the creditors are held liable, the security interests granted to secure the facility may be held void or reduced by a
commercial court. The date at which the proportion should be analyzed is the date when the security interests
were granted, not the date when they were enforced. With regard to the extent by which the security interests
must exceed the amount of the facility to be considered “out of proportion” this is a question which is reviewed
by French courts on a case-by-case basis.

**Status of Creditors**

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of the
proceedings must file a proof of claim with the creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of
the commercial court commencing the proceedings in the Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et
_Commerciales; this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors who have_
not submitted their claims during the relevant period are, except with respect to very limited exceptions, barred
from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings and their unasserted claims are
unenforceable (inopposables) during the safeguard or reorganization plan and even after the plan if the
obligations under the plan have been complied with. Employees are not subject to such limits and are preferential
creditors under French law.

Contractual provisions that would accelerate the payment of the company’s obligations upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings or the occurrence of a state of cessation des paiements are not enforceable under French
law. The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of the
company’s obligations. If, however, the court authorizes the company to continue its activity because a sale of all
of the business is feasible, the company’s obligations which have not yet matured shall only mature as at the date
of the judgment ordering such total sale of the business. The administrator may opt for the continuation (or not)
of on-going contracts (contrats en cours) (except for employment contracts). The continuation of on-going
contracts requires that the company fully performs its contractual obligations arising after the commencement of
the insolvency proceedings. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential
creditors, including employees, the commercial court, officials appointed by the commercial court as required by
the insolvency proceedings, certain post-petition creditors, certain secured creditors and the French tax
authorities.

As from the commencement of insolvency proceedings:

   - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans providing for an initial term of at least one
year, or contracts providing for a payment which is differed by at least one year; even in such a case,
accrued interest cannot bear themselves interest, notwithstanding Article 1343-2 of the French Civil
Code (as it currently stands));

   - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the date of the court decision commencing
the insolvency proceedings, subject to specified exceptions which essentially cover the set-off of related
debts (compensation pour dettes connexes), payments authorized by the supervising judge (juge_commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the_
business; and

   - creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor with respect to any
claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the insolvency proceedings if the objective of such
legal action is:

   - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor
may require that a court determine the amount due);

A-8


-----

   - to terminate or cancel a contract for non-payment of pre-opening amounts owed to the creditor; or

   - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor (subject to limited exceptions).

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including in
particular employees, the commercial court, officials appointed by the commercial court as required by the
insolvency proceedings, certain creditors whose claims arose after the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings, secured creditors and the French tax authorities. Some creditors may nevertheless bypass this order
of priority, e.g., if they benefit from a retention right over certain assets.

**Corporate Benefit Rules—Limitation on Enforcement of the Guarantee**

The grant of a guarantee by a French Guarantor for the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes must be for
the corporate benefit of such French Guarantor. Under Articles L.242-6 and L.244-1 of the French commercial
code, directors and managers of a company incorporated as a société par actions simplifiée (simplified jointstock company) such as the French Guarantors, may be prosecuted for misappropriation of corporate funds and/
or credit if they are determined to have, in bad faith, used the company’s property or credit in a manner which
they knew to be contrary to the company’s interests for personal ends or for the benefit of another company in
which they have a direct or indirect interest.

Furthermore, under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and
void, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the
payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French Guarantor did not receive some real and
adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee as a whole. Existence of
corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are
commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear
guidance.

However, based on current case law certain inter-group transactions (including up-stream guarantees) can be
in the corporate interest of the relevant company, in particular, where the following four criteria are fulfilled:

   - existence of a genuine group of companies to which the guarantor and the person whose obligations are
being guaranteed belong operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective and the
guarantee, and the transaction to which they relate, must be entered into in furtherance of the common
economic interest of the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate
with such group benefit;

   - the risk assumed by a French Guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;

   - the French Guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee which is commensurate with the liability which
it takes on under the guarantee; and

   - the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial capability.

However, such criteria being subject to interpretation and depending on factual matters, the prudent
approach prevailing in the French market is to create a strict correlation between the risk assumed and the benefit
received by a French Guarantor without relying on the corporate benefit of the group (intérêt social de groupe)
and applying the conditions listed above and therefore, limiting the amounts of the guarantee to the amounts
on-lent to the French Guarantors as set out below.

Each Guarantee provided by a French Guarantor will apply only insofar as required to:

(i) guarantee the payment obligations under the Indenture and the notes of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
which are or become Issuer or Note Guarantor from time to time under the Indenture and the notes and incurred

A-9


-----

by those subsidiaries as Issuer and Note Guarantors (without double counting). However, where such subsidiary
is itself a Note Guarantor which guarantees the obligations of a member of the Group which is not a subsidiary of
the relevant French Guarantor, the amounts payable by such French Guarantor under this paragraph (i) in respect
of the obligations of this subsidiary as Note Guarantor shall be limited as set out in paragraph (ii) below; and

(ii) guarantee the payment obligations under the Indenture and the notes of each other Issuer or Note
Guarantor which is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of that French Guarantor, provided that in each case such
guarantee shall be limited to the payment obligations of such other Issuer or Note Guarantor under the Indenture
and the notes provided that these shall not exceed an amount equal to the aggregate of all amounts made
available (directly or indirectly) to such other Issuer or Note Guarantor under the Indenture and the notes and
on-lent (directly or indirectly by way of intra-group loans) to such French Guarantor and outstanding from time
to time (such amount being the “French Maximum Guaranteed Amount”).

It being specified that any payment made by such French Guarantor in accordance with paragraph (ii) above
in respect of the obligations of any other Issuer or Note Guarantor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount
of the intercompany loans (if any) due by such French Guarantor to that Issuer or Note Guarantor under the
intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by a French
Guarantor in respect of the payment obligations of an Issuer or a Note Guarantor referred to in paragraph
(ii) above shall reduce the French Maximum Guaranteed Amount.

No French Guarantor will secure liabilities under the Indenture and the notes which would result in such
French Guarantor not complying with French financial assistance rules as set out in Article L. 225-216 of the
French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the
meaning of Article L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) or any other law
or regulations having the same effect, as interpreted by French courts.

No French Guarantor will be acting jointly and severally with the Issuer and/or the other Note Guarantors
and no French Guarantor shall be deemed to be a “co-débiteur solidaire” as to its obligations arising under or in
connection with any such guarantee given in accordance with the Indenture and the notes. By virtue of this
limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations under the Note Guarantees could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the notes or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the
Note Guarantee should the balance of the portion of the proceeds of the notes made available to a French
Guarantor directly or indirectly be equal to or reduced to zero.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is
less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arms’
length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arms’ length
transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

The rights of the holders of the notes under the Note Guarantee are also subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Note Guarantee is also contractually adjusted so that such guarantee (together with the guarantee
granted under the Credit Facilities) does not result in interest payments not being deductible for corporate income
tax purposes when compared to the position that would have been applicable in the absence of such guarantee
and indemnity obligations. By virtue of this limitation, a Note Guarantor’s obligations under the Note Guarantee
may be less than the amount that a noteholder could have claimed in the absence of such limitation.

**Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_

A-10


-----

Agreement, except for Article L.626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code which states that, in the context of
safeguard proceedings (applicable in judicial reorganization proceedings), the safeguard plan which is put to the
vote of the creditors’ committees takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination
agreements between creditors which were entered into prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings.
As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this offering memorandum, has
received no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain
provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

**Fraudulent Conveyance**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of
insolvency proceedings, called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an
agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees
to provide or provides security for any of such person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional
agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in
or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by, as the case may be, the creditors’ representative or
the trustee in charge of overseeing the implementation of the restructuring plan (commissaire à l’exécution du
_plan) of the relevant debtor, or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the_
act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the
person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the
debtor’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the
act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or
should have known that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their
means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance.
If a court found that the issuance of the notes, the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that
did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the notes, the granting of such
guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor
that lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, the noteholders
may not enjoy the benefit of the notes, the guarantees and the value of any consideration that the noteholders
received with respect to the notes, the guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the noteholders and,
possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, the noteholders might be held
liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Note Guarantors as a result of the
fraudulent conveyance.

**Germany**

**Insolvency**

Several of the Note Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany and have their registered office in
Germany. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the
European Union Regulation No 1346/2000 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered
office is situated. Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to such Note Guarantors (together, the
“German Guarantors”), is likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the German Guarantors were held to have its
centre of main interest within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such
proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including,
inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of
the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of the recovery of payments due on the notes to an
extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency

A-11


-----

Regulation, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is
found to be in a Member State other than Germany. This issue is to be determined at the time when the
competent court decides on the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite
the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency
proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant
entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings
(if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies
in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. A draft act to
facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von
_Konzerninsolvenzen) is currently under discussion in Germany. However, according to this draft act it is mainly_
intended to provide for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies.
The draft act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group
companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst
the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in
order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each
group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all
group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency
administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator”
(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). It is currently
unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified form, this bill might be adopted by the German
parliament.

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or if the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung),
a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values),
unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (positive
_Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due_
and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close
the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to
wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law
stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder_
becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its
shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the
latest within three weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason (i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness)
occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as
sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid
insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments
obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis
period. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of
insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity of the debtor.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take

A-12


-----

preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s moveable assets during these preliminary proceedings. In
addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an_
insolvency proceeding in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the
debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). The order for opening an insolvency
proceeding as debtor-in-possession proceeding requires that (i) it has been requested by the debtor and (ii) no
circumstances are known which lead to the expectation that the order will place the creditors at a disadvantage. If
the debtor’s request for debtor-in-possession proceeding does not manifestly lack the prospect of success, the
court shall in the opening proceedings refrain from (i) imposing on the debtor a general prohibition on making
dispositions or (ii) ordering that all of the debtor’s dispositions are effective only with the consent of a
preliminary insolvency administrator. In this case, instead of a preliminary insolvency administrator, a
preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) shall be appointed who shall supervise the management of the
debtor in the preliminary insolvency proceeding (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung).

If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason
other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such
process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove (by way of a certification provided by a tax advisor,
accountant or lawyer with experience in insolvency matters) that a restructuring of its business is not obviously
futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court shall, upon the request of the debtor, set a deadline of up to three
months for submission of an insolvency plan (Schutzschirm). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce
security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency
court has to appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is
entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the
insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously
not competent or impartial).

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and several other circumstances, the insolvency
court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary
creditors’ committee will be asked for their view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of
the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by
the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such
suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not
impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies,
it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small
creditors as well as one for the employees.

The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the
debtor’s assets (which, depending on the circumstances, includes the continuation of the business carried out by
the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be
sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are
sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the
debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if
third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)
(usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by
the insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In case the court orders
for a debtor-in-possession status, the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the

A-13


-----

debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the
debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being
entitled to request the change of the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first
creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes
cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the
new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual be eligible as officeholder (i.e., sufficiently
qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial
indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the
insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are
preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency
creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency
claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the notes, among others, some important consequences of such
opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries
that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

   - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the insolvent entity would generally pass to the
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless the
court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung);

   - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such insolvent
entity, disposals effected by the management of such insolvent entity, after the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

   - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor
in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in
part of such insolvent entity’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such
security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings;

   - claims against such insolvent entity may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

   - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the
claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to
assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency
proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest
outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain
preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to
enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it
should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in
his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets
(Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims
that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the case of creditors secured by
pledges over shares or company interests forming part of the insolvency estate it is, in the absence of
authoritative case law, uncertain whether the creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect

A-14


-----

of the pledged shares on their own or whether the insolvency administrator has the right to realize the pledges on
behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors.

In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less
certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and
(ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross
enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant
collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the
insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the
costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the
opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—
_Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to_
the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the
preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full.

The preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) of a creditor may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must,
however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law, while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the
opening of insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured
creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are
satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims)
have been fully satisfied.

The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other unsubordinated claims of
insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts if ranking with equal status:
(i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the
insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the
proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal
consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s
gratuitous performance of a consideration; (v) claims for the restitution of shareholder loans
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a
loan; and (vi) claims which the creditor and the debtor agreed to be subordinated in insolvency proceedings.

Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the
relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the
insolvent entity. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such insolvent entity, the claims
against that entity would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in
accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the
rules of the treatment of shareholder loans will itself be exposed inter alia to a claw back risk with respect to
repayments that have been made within the period of one year prior to the request to open insolvency
proceedings or subsequent to such request (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code). Subordinated
insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (or in
any transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing
these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases
governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from the transaction security was a
subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents could result in
holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings aiming at the liquidation of the relevant insolvent debtor, the
value of the insolvent entity’s assets may be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of

A-15


-----

the entity’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be
taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of each class of
creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of
dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—be crammed down). The insolvent entity
itself may only oppose the proposed plan if the plan is detrimental to the insolvent company (in comparison to an
ordinary insolvency proceeding) or if any creditor will receive a higher economic value than the amount of its
claim. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the
debtor can be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to
creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). In this case, the adoption of the insolvency plan generally also requires
the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can—under certain
circumstances—also be crammed down.

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession
proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency
proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are
successfully voided by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged
transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate plus accrued interest. The
administrator’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having
occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of
insolvency proceedings with respect to any insolvent entity based on and governed by the insolvency laws of
Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit
support for the benefit of the notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an
insolvency administrator under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the holders of the notes
may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the notes or the Collateral and may participate in the
insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only. If payments have already been made under the notes or
Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid (plus accrued
interest) to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders of the notes may only have a general
unsecured claim under the notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the
granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the
debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the
filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing);

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if
(i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month
prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the

A-16


-----

other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental
effect);

   - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such
transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction
knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction;

   - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a
third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was
effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

   - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of
prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the
act knew of such intention at the time of such act. Such intention of the debtor and the respective
knowledge of the beneficiary shall be presumed if the debtor and the beneficiary knew of the debtor’s
imminent insolvency, and that the transaction constituted a disadvantage for the creditors;

   - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates
to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years
prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no
knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was
concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain
limitations, members of the management board or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders
owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable
positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other
persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

   - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment
of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place
during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year
prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition; or

   - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security
or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or provider of surety (Bürge) (in which case not the third party but
the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to
prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s
intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the
transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory
presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction”
(Bargeschäft). In case of such “cash transaction”, the avoidance risk can—under certain circumstances—
substantially be reduced.

-----

The German legislature is currently discussing a draft amendment concerning the statutory avoidance
provisions in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Amendments are envisaged with regards to,
among others, the provisions for avoidance claims in connection with willful disadvantage of the creditors, for
cash transactions (Bargeschäfte) and the interest rates on avoidance claims. It is currently unclear if and when,
and whether in its current or modified form, this bill might be adopted by the German parliament.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security
right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings.
The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated
from the date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

**Security**

Under German law it is unclear whether all of the security interests in the collateral give a collateral agent a
right to prevent other creditors of a guarantor or security provider from foreclosing into and realizing the
collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority
(according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization, but not an intervention right
(Drittwiderspruchsrecht). Accordingly, the collateral agent and the holders of the interests in the notes may not
be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors into the collateral, even if they consider such foreclosure untimely.
Moreover, enforcement of the collateral through the German courts may become time-barred or subject to
defenses of setoff or counterclaim.

**Global Assignments**

Under German law, in particular the basic principle of priority (Prioritätsgrundsatz), receivables can only be
validly assigned if, at the time the assignment is made, the assignor has unencumbered title to such receivable or
is authorized by the holder of the receivable to assign such receivable to the relevant assignee. In general,
German law does neither recognize any bona fide acquisition (gutgläubiger Erwerb) of receivables nor can a
pledge of receivables be validly granted solely on a bona fide basis.

If the creditor and the debtor of a receivable have contractually restricted the assignment of such receivable
it cannot be validly assigned unless it is a commercial monetary claim (i.e., claim for the payment of money)
governed by German law and the underlying agreement giving rise to such claim constitutes a commercial
transaction (Handelsgeschäft) or the debtor under such claim is a public law entity (juristische Person des
_öffentlichen Rechts) or public special fund (öffentlich-rechtliches Sondervermögen)._

Under German law, a debtor may

   - invoke against an assignee all defenses it possesses against the assignor at the time of the assignment of
the claim; and

   - under certain circumstances, set-off against the assignee an existing claim which the debtor has against
the assignor.

An assignee must give credit for any payment or other act of performance by the debtor in favor of the
assignor after the assignment unless the debtor knew of the assignment at the time of performance. In addition,
any legal transaction entered into after the assignment between a debtor (being unaware of the assignment) and
the assignor in respect of the debt will have effect against the assignee. If, in any court action between the debtor
and the assignor subsequent to the assignment, a final judgment has been delivered, the assignee is bound by that
judgment, unless the debtor knew of the assignment at the date when the action was first commenced.

A-18


-----

Receivables which are subject to or result from a current account relationship (Kontokorrentverhältnis)
come into in rem existence and can validly be assigned only

   - on each balance date (Abrechnungsstichtag), (but until such current account relationship is terminated
such claims are subject to the continuing current account relationship); and

   - upon termination of the current account relationship (whether by notice or by the initiation of insolvency
proceedings in relation to any party or otherwise in relation to such current account relationship).

An assignment of rights and claims may only be effective if the rights and claims to be assigned are
identifiable (bestimmbar) at the time of the assignment or transfer.

Finally, in case of an assignment of receivables where the underlying supply is subject to value added tax,
such as trade receivables, the assignor and the assignee will be jointly liable for the payment of such value added
tax.

**Pledges**

The same limitations as set out above apply to pledges as a receivable may not validly be pledged if the
transfer of such receivable is restricted. Also, under German law, a pledge may only be validly created in favor of
the creditor(s) of the secured claims and the pledgor will need to notify the relevant debtor of a pledged claim of
such pledge in order to create a valid pledge. Due to the accessory nature of the pledges, the security interests
granted as pledges have been created in favor of the collateral agent acting in its capacity as creditor of a parallel
debt. See “—Accessory Security Interests / Parallel Debt” below.

Since German law does not generally permit for an appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the
occurrence of an enforcement event, an enforcement of a share pledge governed by German law usually requires
the sale of the relevant collateral through a formal disposal process involving a public auction. Certain waiting
periods and notice requirements may apply for such disposal process.

**Accessory Security Interests/Parallel Debt**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict
accessory nature and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require that the security holder and the
creditor of the secured claim be identical. Therefore, pledges may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be
secured by the accessory security interest and other accessory interests. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee who does not itself
hold the secured claim and (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or
novated and (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in
case the relevant secured claim is assigned.

The accessory security interests will be granted to the collateral agent. The collateral agent is however not a
creditor under the notes. The holders of the notes on the other hand are creditors under the notes and the Note
Guarantees but the holders of the interests in the notes from time to time will not be parties to the Collateral
Documents. In order to permit the holders of the notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the
collateral agent under German law the Collateral Documents provide for the creation of a so called “parallel
debt” obligation created under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the collateral agent rather than
secure the claims of holders of the notes directly. The pledges governed by German law will directly secure, in
particular, the parallel debt.

Pursuant to the parallel debt, the collateral agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount
payable by an obligor under, in particular, the notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture, and any payment in
respect of the principal obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of

A-19


-----

the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding principal obligations. Although the collateral agent will have,
pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the debtors under the notes and the Note Guarantors for the full
principal amount due under the notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the
parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt. Therefore, it
cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts and hence there is no certainty
that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the collateral agent to enforce the
collateral may be restricted.

Moreover, the collateral agent does not hold the pledges or the parallel debt in trust. This means that in the
case of an insolvency of the collateral agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the
collateral agent may successfully claim that there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders
with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the
accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) collateral agent.

**Standard Business Terms**

The Collateral Documents may qualify as standard business terms (Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen).
Standard business terms are subject to certain mandatory legal requirements, inter alia, they must be readily
understandable (transparent) and not unduly burdensome to the average addressee. If any such requirements are
not complied with, the relevant standard business terms would be void and replaced by applicable statutory law.

**Excessive Collateral**

According to the case law of the German Federal Court, collateral, and the agreements granting such
collateral, can be void if an initial over-collateralization (anfängliche Übersicherung) is constituted which is so
excessive that it must be considered as being “against good ethics” (gegen die guten Sitten). If, at the time of
entering into a security agreement, it is already certain that the realizable value of the collateral is significantly
out of proportion to the claim secured, the entire German collateral could be regarded as an initially excessive
collateralization. Although no specific case law exists, a decision by the German Federal Court indicates that the
loan-to-collateral ratio would be beyond the threshold applied to subsequent excessive collateralization if the
value of the collateral is more than 150 percent of the amount of the secured obligations. Any valuation,
however, will be based on the realizable value taking into account any possible discount on the current market
value, arising, e.g. from a sale in the then current situation. In addition, the over-collateralization, in order to be
regarded as initially excessive, must be based on a creditor’s reprobate attitude (verwerfliche Gesinnung), which
is assumed if a creditor, out of self-interest, displays an ethically unbearable recklessness against a debtor. In
exceptional circumstances, an excessive loan-to-collateral ratio can, itself, justify the assumption of a reprobate
attitude.

If the realizable value of the collateral at any date after having been granted not only temporarily exceeds
the amount of the secured claims by more than 10 percent, the subsequently excessively secured (nachträglich
_übersichert) creditor is, according to the case law of the German Federal Court, regularly obliged to release_
collateral back to the debtor insofar as the estimated realizable value of collateral, which depends on the risks of
realization of the collateral and on the market situation, exceeds the secured amount by more than such
10 percent. In order to determine the realizable value of the collateral granted, the German Federal Court allows
for a reduction of the face value of the collateral, thus, permitting that the face value of the collateral is up to
150 percent of the amounts secured from time to time. In case and to the extent that the realizable value of the
aggregate collateral exceeds 110 percent of the secured obligations, the secured creditor would, on demand by
the collateral provider, have to release excess collateral.

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests**

Each of the German Guarantors guaranteeing and providing collateral is established in the form of a German
limited liability company (“GmbH”) (each a “German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor”). Consequently, the

A-20


-----

granting of a Note Guarantee or Collateral by such German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor is subject to certain
provisions relating to preservation of the statutory capital under the German Limited Liability Company Act
(Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”). These provisions would also apply
to any future guarantor incorporated in the form of a GmbH or established as a limited partnership with a limited
liability company as general partner (“GmbH & Co. KG”; the German GmbH Subsidiary Guarantor, any future
subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated as a GmbH or established as a GmbH & Co. KG are hereinafter jointly
referred to as a “German Subsidiary Guarantors” and each a “German Subsidiary Guarantor”).

The enforcement of the Note Guarantee and of the Collateral granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor to
secure the Issuer’s debt will be limited if, and to the extent, payments under the Note Guarantee or the
enforcement of the Collateral would cause the amount of such German Subsidiary Guarantor’s (or in the case the
German Subsidiary Guarantor is a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets (i.e., total assets less
liabilities and liability reserves) in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB)) to fall below the
amount of its stated share capital.

As a general rule, the provisions of the GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its
shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbHs net assets would fall below the amount of its stated
share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative amount of its net assets would further be reduced and
prohibit payments to shareholders which render the German Subsidiary Guarantor unable to pay its debts as they
fall due. Guarantees or security interests granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of liabilities or
payments of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as payments under any arrangements that are not
at arm’s length terms are considered disbursements under the provisions of the GmbHG.

In order to enable German Subsidiary Guarantors to grant Guarantees and to provide Collateral to secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating the provisions of the
GmbHG and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit
agreements, indentures, guarantees and collateral documents to contain so called “limitation language” in relation
to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG.

Pursuant to such “limitation language,” the secured parties contractually agree, subject to certain
exemptions, to enforce the security interests and the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to enforce the
guarantees against a German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG (or to release the proceeds of an
enforcement, as applicable) only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s—
or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net asset falling below the amount of its stated share
capital or increasing such shortfall in order to avoid a violation of the applicable provisions of the German
GmbHG.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the documentation with respect to the Collateral and the
Note Guarantee, to the extent provided by a German Subsidiary Guarantor, contains or will contain such
contractual limitation language. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Note Guarantee or
Collateral granted by such German Subsidiary Guarantor cannot be enforced at all and the holders of the notes
will lose the benefit of the Note Guarantee or Collateral, respectively.

The German capital maintenance rules and the other provisions referred to above are subject to evolving
case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets
of German Subsidiary Guarantors, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the
notes or of a German Subsidiary Guarantors to make payments on the Note Guarantee or negatively affect the
ability to enforce the Collateral.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so called “destructive interference” (existenzvemichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation where a shareholder deprives a German Subsidiary Guarantor of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its

A-21


-----

own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Note Guarantee or any
Collateral granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an
enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if
a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be
able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that
German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Note Guarantee and/or Collateral by a
German Subsidiary Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated
share capital of the respective German Subsidiary Guarantor of the Note Guarantee or Collateral could become
personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally
influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores
(Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that a German Subsidiary Guarantor when granting the Note Guarantee and/or the
Collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German subsidiary of the Issuer based on and
governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (or in the event
debtor-in-possession status has been granted, the preliminary trustee (Sachwalter) may possibly challenge
(anfechten) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German insolvency code (Insolvenzordnung) (i) a
guarantee granted by that entity, (ii) payments that have been made (under the Note Guarantee or in relation to
any collateral), if such payments have already been made or (iii) any other collateral granted by that entity. For
details of such voidance rights, see “—Insolvency.”

**Creditor Liability**

The beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the
guarantee or security could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to
act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of
the legal principle of contra bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of
the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or security has been
close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Under such
circumstances, the Note Guarantees or other collateral may also be invalid.

**Hungary**

The notes will be guaranteed by VALEANT PHARMA Hungary LLC, a limited liability company
incorporated under the laws of Hungary, or the “Hungarian Guarantor”.

**Limitation on Enforceability**

In general, a Hungarian court will apply Hungarian private international law regime when determining
choice of law issues in respect of private law claims. Accordingly, the enforceability of U.S. federal securities
laws or judgments of U.S. courts (e.g., stay orders in moratorium) may be decided on a case by case basis.

A judgment in relation to any Note Guarantee obtained against the Hungarian Guarantor from a New York
Court will not be directly recognized by the Hungarian courts in the absence of relevant reciprocity arrangement,
bilateral or multilateral international agreements for the mutual enforcement of civil law judgments or local law

A-22


-----

(at present none of them are available). However, separate legal proceedings may be commenced in the
Hungarian courts for an amount due under a judgment given by the New York Courts and that judgment may be
deemed by the Hungarian courts in separate proceedings to be conclusive (as evidence or otherwise) in Hungary
as between the parties as to all relevant issues upon which it adjudicates. The Hungarian courts have wide
discretion, but recognition may be generally granted unless the judgment can be impeached pursuant to
Hungarian mandatory rules (e.g., the recognition and/or enforcement of the judgment would be contrary to the
public policy of Hungary, the relevant court in the U.S. had no jurisdiction or generally accepted international
procedural principals have not been complied with).

The express choice of the laws of the State of New York is subject to mandatory provisions of Hungarian
law that in exceptional circumstances (e.g., breach of public policy, the choice results in illegality or the choice is
not bona fide) competent Hungarian courts may change, invalidate or supplement (e.g., new terms of contract)
certain provisions of the transaction documents and/or related rights and/or obligations of the contracting parties.

The enforceability of obligations assumed by the Hungarian Guarantor are subject to Hungarian corporate,
bankruptcy and insolvency law that under exceptional circumstances protecting the interest of the creditors and/
or minority owners may allow for a challenge of certain obligations that may eventually lead to the nullification
of agreements or certain provisions (e.g., agreement to obtain security interest or receive pre-payments in a
pre-petition period with the intention to defraud or mislead other creditors, with liquidation challenge look back
periods of 5 years, 2 years, 90 days and 60 days). The successful challenge may even result in the termination of
registered pledges or repayment obligations or in setting aside various contractual terms.

**Hungarian Insolvency Considerations**

Hungarian insolvency proceedings, including bankruptcy, liquidation and winding up (voluntary
liquidation) proceedings, are non-contentious proceedings and extend to all assets of the Hungarian Guarantor
existing on the commencement date.

**Bankruptcy**

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to make arrangements for the settlement of creditors’ claims
against a debtor. As part of bankruptcy proceedings, a debt moratorium lasting between 120-360 days could be
ordered by the competent bankruptcy court and consequently any enforcement actions and most of the ordinary
distributions would be suspended against the Hungarian Guarantor until negotiations are underway. This would
prevent the holders of the notes from enforcing their security rights. If there is no agreement reached with the
relevant majority by the creditors classes, the court will order the commencement of liquidation proceedings. The
Hungarian bankruptcy regime does not support the parties reaching agreement in this phase and, in practice, the
vast majority of Hungarian bankruptcy proceedings eventually turn into liquidation proceedings.

**Liquidation**

The purpose of liquidation proceedings is to satisfy the claims of creditors of an insolvent debtor in the
course of terminating a debtor without a legal successor. Subsequent to the commencement date of the
liquidation, the ownership rights related to the Hungarian Guarantor would fall away, the liquidator would legally
and effectively take over the management of the assets and activities of the company, any monetary or
enforcement related claims against the Hungarian Guarantor could only be enforced as part of the liquidation
proceedings and all debt of the Hungarian Guarantor would become due and payable.

Following a period of 40 days subsequent to the publication of the liquidation order, the creditors and the
debtor may, at any time, enter into a composition agreement with an aim to settle and/or restructure their debt,
before the submission date of the closing liquidation balance-sheet. Upon the debtor’s request, the court shall
hold a composition negotiation within 60 days following receipt of the petition. The debtor must prepare a
schedule and an appropriate proposal for the purpose of restoring its solvency.

A-23


-----

During the negotiation, the debtor and the creditors may agree on:

(i) the order of satisfying the debts,

(ii) the modification of the deadline for the debt payments;

(iii) the ratio and manner of the satisfaction of the debts; and

(iv) all issues which are considered necessary by the parties for the purpose of restoring the solvency of the
debtor, in particular, measures increasing the revenues of the debtor.

The agreement may only be implemented if at least half of the creditors representing the various classes of
creditor claims consent and the total amount of claims of such creditors reaches two thirds of the aggregate
creditor claims.

In the absence of a restructuring agreement, the assets of the debtor shall be publicly disposed (generally by
a public auction) by the liquidator at the highest price that can be obtained on the market. Under Hungarian
insolvency law the sale proceeds of the Hungarian Guarantor’s assets would be distributed in accordance with the
following order of priority (the list that follows is non-exhaustive):

(i) costs of the liquidation;

(ii) claims secured by pledge or mortgage before the initial date of liquidation;

(iii) alimonies, life-annuity payments, compensation allowance, mining salary supplements payable by
economic organizations, furthermore, monetary contributions granted to members of agricultural cooperatives
instead of household land or crops of which the beneficiary is entitled to receive for a lifetime;

(iv) with the exception of claims based on bonds, other claims of private individuals not originating from
economic activities (in particular claims resulting from insufficient performance or compensation for damages,
also including the amount of the guarantee and warrantee obligations ordinarily expected in the given trade, as
calculated by the liquidator), claims of small and micro companies and of agricultural primary producers and
certain claims of the Common Capital Maintenance Funds of Credit Cooperatives;

(v) debts of social insurance and private pension fund membership fees, taxes—with the exception of tax
debts that are classified as cost of liquidation—and public debts collectable as taxes, repayable state aids and
water and sewage fees;

(vi) other claims; and

(vii) irrespective of the time and grounds of its occurrence, default interests and late charges, and debts of
fines and bonuses.

The costs of liquidation are as follows:

(i) wages and other similar benefits payable by the debtor—including severance pay due at the termination
of employment if the wages and other similar benefits became due prior to the initial date of liquidation were
paid after the initial date of liquidation, as well as the connected tax and contribution obligations (including
social security contributions and private pension fund membership fees);

(ii) costs in connection with the rational completion of the economic activities of the debtor following the
initial date of liquidation, and furthermore, the costs connected to the protection and maintenance of the debtor’s

A-24


-----

assets, including the costs of settling environmental damages and burdens, and those credit debts, tax and
contribution payment (including social security contributions and private pension fund membership fees) and
compensation obligations of the debtor that are originated from economic activities after the initial date of
liquidation, with the exception of the taxes to be paid from the profits;

(iii) verified costs connected to the sale of the assets and the enforcement of claims;

(iv) aids received from the wage guarantee fund of Labour Market Fund and debited to the debtor;

(v) costs incurred during the court and official proceedings in connection with liquidation, payable by the
debtor;

(vi) costs in connection with the arrangement, placement and safeguarding of the debtor’s documents;

(vii) liquidator’s fees; and

(viii) certain costs and expenses related to funds advanced by the state to mitigate or manage environmental
and other risks.

**Simplified Liquidation**

If the assets of the Hungarian Guarantor would not be sufficient even to cover the expected costs of
liquidation, or the proceedings are technically non-executable due to inadequate books and records of the
Hungarian Guarantor, upon the request of the liquidator, the court could order the direct distribution of the assets
and uncollected claims of the debtor to the creditors in the above priority order prescribed by Hungarian
insolvency law. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that any holder of the notes could obtain monetary
compensation under such circumstances.

**Suspect Transactions**

The liquidator has wide powers to challenge certain declarations and agreements if they are deemed to be
detrimental to the creditors of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate and made prior and subsequent to the filing of
insolvency petition.

a) In particular, the liquidator may challenge any agreements or declarations made in a five-year period
prior to the petition filing if the debtor conspired with the intention to mislead its creditors and as a result the
value of the debtor’s assets decreased.

b) Certain transactions related to free disposal of assets, assumption of obligations without consideration or
with conditions that are obviously not at arm’s length can be challenged if entered into in a two-year period prior
to the filing of the petition.

c) If the debtor provides preferential treatment by declaration or an agreement to any of its creditors in the
last 90 days leading up to the petition, including an amendment of contract with favourable terms to a creditor or
provision of collateral to an unsecured creditor, the liquidator may challenge such contract or declaration.

d) The pre-petition look back period is 60 days; if the liquidator finds that certain services or voluntary
prepayments were made to a creditor and such conduct cannot be considered to be carried out in the ordinary
course of business, the liquidator may reclaim these services or payments.

If agreements are entered into between companies that are connected through direct or indirect ownership,
the Hungarian insolvency law operates under a legal assumption that such agreements were entered into in bad
faith and without consideration.

A-25


-----

If a challenge is successful the relevant agreements or declarations could be avoided or held unenforceable
and other legal consequences of nullity would become applicable. If the provision of the guarantee or Hungarian
law governed collateral by the Hungarian Guarantor would be challenged successfully, any related rights of the
holders of the notes could be terminated and payment made in the suspect periods would need to be repaid.

**Capital Maintenance Laws**

Current capital maintenance laws limit the rights of the Hungarian Guarantor to make a distribution to its
owners and basically require that such distribution be specifically authorized by law and in general cannot lead or
contribute to an insolvency situation. The interaction of relevant capital maintenance and corporate benefit
doctrines of the new Hungarian Civil Code have not been tested yet. Therefore, the possibility that a future
judicial practice specifically addresses the collateral obligations assumed by a guarantor for the benefit of its
direct or indirect parents and requires that such an obligation be limited statutorily or contractually to a level that
does not endanger the liquidity of the grantor, thus effectively nullifying certain obligations hitherto assumed by
the Hungarian Guarantor, cannot be excluded.

**Collateral Agent**

The direct recognition and enforceability of foreign law security trust or security agency concepts in
enforcement against assets held in Hungary is not possible. In order to mitigate the risk, each agent (on the basis
of the authorizations of the secured parties) must be authorized and appointed as Hungarian collateral agent
(zálogjogosulti bizományos) pursuant to Article 5:96. § of Act V of 2013 on the new Hungarian Civil Code
(“New Hungarian Civil Code”), in respect of the Hungarian pledges.

**Ireland**

**Enforceability**

Certain guarantors of the notes are companies incorporated under the laws of Ireland (any such guarantor, an
“Irish Guarantor”).

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against any Irish Guarantor
in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is
some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts
obtained against an Irish Guarantor or its directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S.
federal or state securities laws or hear actions against an Irish Guarantor or those persons based on those laws.

**Center of Main Interest**

Each Irish Guarantor has its registered office in Ireland and, as a result, there is a rebuttable presumption
that its center of main interest is in Ireland and consequently that any main insolvency proceedings applicable to
it would be governed by Irish law. If the center of main interest of an Irish Guarantor is not located in Ireland,
and is held to be in a different jurisdiction within the European Union, main insolvency proceedings may not be
opened in Ireland. Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial or secondary proceedings may be commenced
in other Member States of the European Union (except Denmark) even if the center of main interests is in
Ireland; provided that the company has an establishment in that other Member State. The effects of these
secondary proceedings would be restricted to the assets of the relevant company situated in that other Member
State.

**Insolvency**

Irish insolvency law may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United States or other
jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that an Irish Guarantor experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

A-26


-----

Any insolvency proceedings applicable to an Irish Guarantor will be likely to be governed by Irish
insolvency laws so long as the center of main interest of the Irish Guarantor is in Ireland. Irish insolvency laws
and other limitations could limit the enforceability of any guarantee granted, or security interest created, by an
Irish Guarantor, irrespective of the governing law or jurisdiction of such guarantee or security interest. Where a
guarantee or security interest is granted by an Irish Guarantor that is governed by the laws of another country, the
Irish court should apply that foreign law to the guarantee or security interest notwithstanding that the Irish
Guarantor has entered insolvency proceedings governed by Irish insolvency law.

Certain aspects of Irish insolvency law relating to limitations on a guarantee or security interest provided by
a company (such as an Irish Guarantor) could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under
such guarantee or security and/or other security in respect of the notes and, therefore, may affect the validity or
enforceability of such guarantee or security and limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of
the provider of such guarantee or security (such as an Irish Guarantor).

**Liquidation**

Liquidation is a procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator
to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Irish Companies Act (see “—Priorities of Claims
on Liquidation”). A company can itself resolve to put itself into liquidation (a ‘voluntary’ liquidation, being
either a members’ voluntary liquidation if the company is solvent or a creditors’ voluntary liquidation if
insolvent) or a court can be petitioned by creditors or contributors of a company to put the company into
liquidation, being a court liquidation. At the end of the liquidation process the company is dissolved.

In a liquidation, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against the company
except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose (although security enforcement is
not affected).

**_Priority of Claims on Liquidation_**

Under Irish insolvency law, the liabilities of a company such as an Irish Guarantor would be paid only after
certain of its other debts which are entitled to priority under Irish law, as set out below.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

   - _First-ranking claims: remuneration, costs and expenses of an examiner where a company goes into_
liquidation after a failed examinership process that are approved by a court (see “—Examinership”);

   - _Second-ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in_
assets of the debtor company;

   - _Third-ranking claims: expenses certified by the examiner under section 529 of the Irish Companies Act_
being liabilities incurred by the company during the protection period which the examiner deems
necessary to allow the company to continue to operate through the protection period, which certification
may be reviewed by the court;

   - _Fourth-ranking claims: costs and expenses of the winding up of the company;_

   - _Fifth-ranking claims: liquidator’s fees;_

   - _Sixth-ranking claims: any sum which would have been deducted from the remuneration of an employee_
in respect of an employment contribution (as defined in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 of
Ireland) for a period of employment before a winding-up had that remuneration been paid before the
winding-up;

   - _Seventh-ranking claims: preferential creditors. Preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts_
owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) certain pension entitlements; (ii) wages and salaries of

A-27


-----

employees for work done in a defined period before the insolvency date, up to a maximum per person;
and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination
takes place before or after the insolvency date. As between one another, preferential debts rank equally;

   - _Eighth-ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security,_
such as the floating charges included in the security purported to be provided by an Irish Guarantor in
support of guarantees in respect of the New notes granted by the Irish Guarantor (see “—Challenges to
Guarantees and Security—Floating Charges”);

   - _Ninth-ranking claims: unsecured creditors;_

   - _Tenth-ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any_
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

**Receivership**

A receiver is a person appointed by a security holder to realize the assets secured by a security document in
discharge or part discharge of a debtor’s liability to a security holder. The receiver’s function is to take
possession of the secured assets and discharge any unpaid indebtedness from the proceeds. The powers conferred
on a receiver, and the circumstances of a receiver’s appointment, depend to a large extent on the provisions of the
particular security document and are also set forth in the Irish Companies Act, which gives a receiver a wide
range of statutory powers in addition to any powers contained in the security document. The terms of the security
document may provide for the appointment of a receiver-manager, in which case the receiver can continue to
operate the business during the course of the receivership with a view to maximizing the value of the charged
assets. The terms of the security governed by Irish law which is granted in respect of the notes provide broad
powers in favor of any receiver appointed pursuant to the terms thereof.

**Examinership**

Examinership is a court procedure available under the Irish Companies Act to facilitate the survival of Irish
companies in financial difficulty. Examinership is a rescue mechanism which can be used by a company in
financial difficulty where that company has a reasonable prospect of survival, if restructured. It allows a
company a period of protection from its creditors within which time the examiner will endeavor to put together a
survival plan. During this period of protection no holders of guarantees or security may take any steps to enforce
such guarantees or security against the company. There are four primary pre-requisites to the appointment of an
examiner: (i) that the company is, or is likely to be, unable to pay its debts; (ii) that no resolution subsists for the
winding up of the company; (iii) that no order has been made for the winding up of the company; and (iv) that
there is a reasonable prospect of survival of the company as a going concern.

In examinership, the scheme of arrangement can be approved involving the writing down of the level of
debts due from the company to the holders of guarantees and security, including fixed and floating charges. A
compromise or scheme of arrangement under an examinership may be implemented with the support of a
majority in number (also representing a majority by value) of just one class of creditors subject to confirmation
by the Irish High Court that the compromise or scheme is not unfair or inequitable or unfairly prejudicial to
nonconsenting classes of creditors. That said, the court will only in exceptional circumstances approve a scheme
of arrangement where the holders of a fixed or floating charge would get less under the scheme of arrangement
than they would obtain in realizing the assets the subject of the fixed or floating charges.

The primary risks to the holders of the notes if an examiner were appointed to an Irish Guarantor are as
follows:

   - the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved involving the writing down or
rescheduling of any debt due by an Irish Guarantor;

A-28


-----

   - the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative pledge in the documents pertaining to the
notes prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by an Irish Guarantor to enable
the examiner to borrow to fund an Irish Guarantor during the protection period; and

   - in the event that a scheme of arrangement is not approved and an Irish Guarantor subsequently goes into
liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings incurred by the
examiner on behalf of an Irish Guarantor and approved by the Irish High Court) will take priority over
the monies and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by an Irish
Guarantor to, ultimately, the holders of the notes.

**Challenges to Guarantees and Security**

There are circumstances under Irish insolvency law in which transactions, including the granting by an Irish
company of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if a liquidator is
appointed to the company within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if
during the specified period a liquidator is appointed to a company, the liquidator may challenge the validity of
the security or guarantee given by such company. We cannot be certain that, in the event of the onset of the
insolvency of a provider of a guarantee or security (such as an Irish Guarantor) if the main insolvency
proceedings applicable to the provider would be governed by Irish insolvency law that is within any of the
requisite time periods set forth below, the grant of any guarantee or security will not be challenged or that a court
would uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Fraudulent Preference_**

Under Irish insolvency law, a liquidator of a company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a
security interest or a guarantee granted or a payment made by such company (or give other relief) on the grounds
such security interest or such guarantee or payment constituted an unfair preference. The grant of a security
interest or guarantee or making of a payment is an unfair preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a
surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than
if the security interest or guarantee or payment had not been granted or made. For a challenge to be made, the
decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the commencement of the
liquidation if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee or payment is not a “connected person”. The
look back period is two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. In addition, the company must have been
insolvent at the time it gave the preference or become unable to pay its debts as a result. A court will not make an
order in respect of an unfair preference of a person unless it is satisfied that the dominant intention of the
transaction was to prefer one creditor over other creditors. If the court determines that the transaction was an
unfair preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been
if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting
aside the security interests or guarantees). There is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction
and acted in good faith and for value.

**_Improper Transfer / Transaction Having the Effect of a Fraud on Creditors_**

Irish insolvency law provides that when a company is insolvent or near insolvency its assets are held for the
benefit of its creditors. Pursuant to the Irish Companies Act, if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator,
creditor or contributory of a company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the Irish High Court, that
any property of that company was disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or
mortgage) and the effect of such a disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on the company, its creditors or members,
the Irish High Court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have “use,
control or possession” of the property concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development of that property,
to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit.
There are also circumstances where a creditor or receiver could invoke this provision of Irish law where a
winding-up has not taken place due to the lack of assets to fund a liquidation.

A-29


-----

There is relatively little case law on the interpretation of these sections of the Irish Companies Act.
However, it is clear that the Irish High Court can apply a very wide interpretation to the provision so as to allow
virtually any kind of transaction to come within its scope. It is also clear that the Irish High Court will not require
the liquidator or creditor challenging a transaction to prove intent to defraud creditors, rather they will only have
to show that the effect of the transaction was to perpetrate a fraud on creditors.

Notwithstanding the lack of judicial guidance, it is considered likely that the Irish High Court would not
regard a transaction as having the effect of a fraud upon creditors if the transaction was concluded on market
terms and not at an undervalue so that, in effect, the balance sheet of the company concerned was not
immediately adversely impacted following the completion of the transaction.

Finally, it should be noted that in order for these provisions of the Irish Companies Act to have any effect on
the entry into of, or any payment under, any guarantee of the notes by the Irish Guarantor, there must first be an
insolvency of the Irish Guarantor (whether by virtue of liquidation, receivership or an examinership).

**_Floating Charges_**

Floating charges, such as those which are included in the security purported to be provided by each Irish
Guarantor in support of guarantees granted by each Irish Guarantor in respect of the notes, are a form of security
which allow a company to manage assets subject to the charge in the ordinary course of its business, meaning
that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to
the assets free of the floating charge prior to such time as the floating charge crystallizes and fixes over the
assets. Events that crystallize the floating security will be set out in the security document establishing such
charge together with certain crystalizing events that occur by operation of law. The floating security would
include any charge that was stated to be or purported to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but
which, on a proper interpretation, is rendered or deemed a floating charge.

Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security. Under Irish law, a court has
discretion to recharacterize as floating charges any security interests expressed to be created as fixed charges
where the charge does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the
relevant assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice.

Under Irish insolvency law, if a company is shown to have been insolvent at the time of (or as a result of)
granting a floating charge then such floating charge can be avoided on the action of a liquidator if it was granted
in the period of one year ending with the commencement of the insolvency process (or two years if grant was to a
connection person).

**_Dispositions in Winding-up_**

Under the Irish Companies Act, any dispositions of a company’s property made after the date of liquidation
are void, unless the court orders otherwise.

**_Asset Swelling on Insolvency_**

Where there is a shortfall of available assets, the Irish Companies Act provides that on the application of the
liquidator or any creditor or contributory of a company that is being wound up, the court, if it is satisfied that it is
just and equitable to do so, may order that a company that is or has been related to the company being wound up
shall pay to the liquidator of that company an amount equivalent to the whole or part of all or any of the debts
provable in that winding up. Any such order may be made on such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit.

The Irish Companies Act provides that, where two or more related companies are being wound up under
Irish insolvency law, and if the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to do so, both companies may be
wound up together as if they were one company (a “pooling order”). A pooling order does not affect the rights of
any secured creditor of any companies which are subject to it.

A-30


-----

**Limitation on Enforcement**

The grant of a guarantee or security by an Irish incorporated company in respect of the obligations of
another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements including corporate benefit. A director of an Irish
incorporated company must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the
success of an Irish incorporated company, as the case may be, for the benefit of its members as a whole. If a
company enters into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, the transaction could be
challenged as unenforceable. Furthermore, the directors of the company may be found as abusing their powers as
directors.

**Luxembourg**

**Registration in Luxembourg**

If any of the notes, security interest agreements, indentures, guarantees, transaction documents (and any
document in connection therewith) is (i) voluntarily registered in Luxembourg or (ii) attached to a public deed or
to any other document that requires mandatory registration in Luxembourg, a registration fee (droit
d’enregistrement) will be due, the amount of which will depend on the nature of the document(s) to be registered.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the notes, the security
interest agreements, the indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in
connection therewith) and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

**Insolvency Proceedings**

The notes will be guaranteed by Valeant International Luxembourg S.à r.l., Valeant Pharmaceuticals
Luxembourg S.à r.l., Valeant Holdings Luxembourg S.à r.l., Valeant Finance Luxembourg S.à r.l., Biovail
International S.à r.l. and Bausch & Lomb Luxembourg S.à r.l., which are all incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg (each a “Luxembourg Guarantor” and together, the “Luxembourg Guarantors”)

Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open main insolvency
proceedings with respect to the Luxembourg Guarantors, as entity having its registered office and central
administration (administration centrale) and centre of main interest (“COMI”), as used in Regulation (EU)
2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU
Insolvency Regulation”), in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg
insolvency laws. According to the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company
has its COMI in the jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office. As a result, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the COMI of the Luxembourg Guarantors is in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and
consequently that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) would be
opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law.

However, the determination of where each of the Luxembourg Guarantors has its COMI is a question of
fact, which may change from time to time. EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should
correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which
is ascertainable by third parties.

Certain privileges, such as the privileges of the Luxembourg tax authorities or social security institutions
over certain specific assets, may take precedence over any security or privileges of other creditors of the
Luxembourg Guarantors.

The obligations of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be limited by general principles of bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, reconstruction or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights
generally and, in particular:

   - during a gestion contrôlée (controlled management) procedure under the Grand-Ducal Decree dated
May 24, 1935 on the procedure of gestion contrôlée, the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a
final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management;

   - the obligations of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected and, after their performance, subject to
annulment by a court on the basis of Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the
documents entered into by the Luxembourg Guarantors have been entered into during the hardening
period (période suspecte) (which is the period starting on the date determined by the bankruptcy court as
being the date on which the debtor is unable to pay its due and payable liabilities (the “Cessation of
Payments”) which cannot be earlier than 6 months before the date of the bankruptcy judgment, and
ending on the date of the bankruptcy judgment) or ten days before. Such documents may come under
Article 445 if they constitute or contain, or the performance of such obligations thereunder would
constitute (a) a contract for the transfer of movable or immovable property done without consideration,
or a contract or transaction done with notably insufficient consideration for the insolvent party, or (b) a
payment, whether in cash or by transfer, assignment, sale, set-off or otherwise for debts not yet due, or a
payment other than in cash or bills of exchange for debts due, or (c) a contractual or judiciary mortgage,
pledge, or charge on the debtor’s assets for previously contracted debts. Article 445 of the Luxembourg
Code of Commerce is not applicable to valid financial collateral agreements subject to the law of
5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements (as amended) (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”);

   - the obligations of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected and after their performance, subject to
annulment by a bankruptcy court on the basis of Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if
the transaction constitute or contain, or the performance of such obligations thereunder would constitute
a payment for due debts or an onerous act done by the Luxembourg Guarantors after the Cessation of
Payments (such date as determined by the bankruptcy court) and prior to the judgment opening
insolvency proceedings, if the counter-party that has received from or dealt with the Luxembourg
Guarantors had knowledge of the Cessation of Payments. Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of
Commerce is not applicable to valid financial collateral agreements subject to the Luxembourg
Collateral Law;

   - regardless of the date of execution and performance, the documents entered into by the Luxembourg
Guarantors may be declared null and void in relation to the Luxembourg Guarantors, if they have been
entered into or issued with the fraudulent intent of the parties thereto to deprive other creditors of the
insolvent party of their rights (Article 448 of the Code of Commerce);

   - however the annulment of the documents entered into by the Luxembourg Guarantors on the basis of
articles 445, 446 or 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce may not be pronounced, according to
the EU Insolvency Regulation, if the person who benefited from an act detrimental to all the creditors
provides proof that (a) the said act is subject to the law of a European Union Member State other than
that of Luxembourg, and (b) that law does not allow any means of challenging that act in the relevant
case;

   - under Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, certain creditors of the insolvent party have rights to
preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances,
supersede the rights to payment of secured creditors, and most of which are preferences arising by
operation of law. This includes in particular the rights relating to the fees and costs of the court
appointed insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of
salary, the rights of the tax administration and certain assimilated parties (such as the social security
organisms), as well as certain other rights, which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of
the insolvent party;

A-32


-----

   - the obligations of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected or limited by the rights of the receiver,
liquidator or other court official appointed in the insolvency proceedings to selectively perform
contracts profitable to the insolvent party’s estate and renounce to the performance of contracts which
are not profitable to the insolvent party’s estate (“cherry-picking”), where such contracts have not been
terminated automatically by the opening of the insolvency proceedings on the basis of an express
contractual provision, or by operation of law; the counterparty to that agreement (a) may enter a claim
for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim shall rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured
creditors and/or (b) seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved; it will, however, no longer
be possible to seek injunctive relief or to require specific performance.

**Continuance of On-Going Contracts**

The bankruptcy receiver (curateur) decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts
(i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business
of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does
not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

   - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an
early termination or acceleration event; and

   - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment
since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to
continue to perform under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be
performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the
bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim
will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant
contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.

**Fraudulent Conveyance**

Third parties (including, without limitation, any commissaire, juge-commissaire, liquidateur or curateur or
similar official) are also admitted to challenge certain acts of disposal viewed as preferential transactions made
by the Luxembourg Guarantors if, among other things, they can show that the Luxembourg Guarantors have
given “preference” to any person by defrauding their rights (the rights of creditors generally), under the action
_paulienne (action pauliana), and Luxembourg courts have the power to void the preferential transaction._

Finally, any international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management and composition
proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation.

**Security Interests**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be subject
to validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render such security
interests invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities (e.g. judicial
or non-judicial consent) and may be time consuming in the event that the foreclosure takes place under judicial
control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or
guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the
security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by
conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or
mandatory legal provisions. Case law on security interests over intellectual property rights is very limited.

Luxembourg courts would have in principle jurisdiction for any conservatory or provisional action in
connection with assets located in Luxembourg and such action would most likely be governed by Luxembourg
law.

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration,
notification and acceptance requirements:

   - A share pledge agreement must be acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the
shares.

   - A pledge over receivables becomes enforceable against the debtor of the receivables and third parties
from the moment when the agreement pursuant to which the pledge was created is entered into between
the pledgor and the pledgee. However, a debtor may validly fulfil and extinguish its obligation to pay its
debt by making a payment to its creditor (being the pledgor), as long as such debtor does not have
knowledge of the creation of pledge over the claim, including in case of enforcement of the security
interest created by a collateral agreements subject the Luxembourg Collateral Law.

   - A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank. In addition, the
account bank has to waive any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant
account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional
notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such registrations, notifications and
acceptances occur, the pledge agreements are not effective and perfected against the debtors, the
account banks and other third parties.

The Luxembourg Collateral Law sets out the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence
of an enforcement event:

   - appropriation of the pledged assets at a price determined, before or after their appropriation, by the
agreed upon valuation method;

   - assignment of the pledged assets by private sale in a commercially reasonable manner, by sale over a
stock exchange or by public auction;

   - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; and

   - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the
method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to
involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security
interests might be substantially delayed.

**Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees**

Any judgment awarded in the courts of Luxembourg may be expressed in a currency other than the euro or
the euro equivalent at the time of judgment or payment. However, any obligation to pay a sum or money in any
currency other than the euro will be enforceable in Luxembourg in terms of the euro only.

The granting of cross- or up-stream security interests and guarantees by a Luxembourg company in order to
secure the obligations of other entities may raise some corporate benefit issues, in particular in relation to the
corporate interest of the Luxembourg company having to provide such security interests/guarantees. The
Luxembourg company law does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to
guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A Luxembourg company must act for its own
benefit (spécialité légale) and in its own corporate interest.

A-34


-----

Whether an action is in the corporate interest of a company is a matter of fact not a legal issue. The
managers of a company are those who are able to assess whether such company has a corporate benefit and
interest in granting cross- or up-stream security interests or guarantees.

Under Luxembourg law, a company may give a guarantee/security interest provided the giving of the
guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate objects and in the best interest of the company. The test
regarding the guarantor’s corporate interest is whether the company that provides the guarantee/ security interest
receives some consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is
proportionate to the burden of the assistance. A guarantee/security interest that exceeds the guarantor company’s
ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other creditors would expose its
managers to personal liability. It cannot ultimately be excluded that granting of security interest/guarantee, which
would be considered by a Luxembourg court as made in the absence of corporate interest, be declared void.

The Note Guarantee granted by the Luxembourg Guarantors may be limited to a certain percentage of,
among other things, the company’s own funds (capitaux propres) and intra-group indebtedness.

Finally, each of the Luxembourg Guarantors has been incorporated in the form of a private limited liability
company (société à responsabilité limitée). Enforcement on these entities will depend on their financial situation
and will only be limited to their assets. Shareholders of a private limited liability company cannot in principle be
held liable for debts contracted by the private limited liability company.
