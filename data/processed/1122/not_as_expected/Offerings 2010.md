ending on or prior to the transaction date. In addition, the “Total Leverage Ratio” will be calculated in a manner consistent with the
definition of “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” to give effect to the transactions that would require pro forma adjustments to such
ratio.

“Transactions” means the “Transactions” as defined in the section of the Offering Circular under the heading “Summary.”

“Treasury Rate” means the rate per annum equal to the yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury
securities with a constant maturity most nearly equal to the period from such date of redemption to October 1, 2014 (in the case of
the 2017 Securities) or October 1, 2015 (in the case of the 2020 Securities); provided, however, that if the period from such date of
redemption to October 1, 2014 (in the case of the 2017 Securities) or October 1, 2015 (in the case of the 2020 Securities) is not
equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate
shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United
States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such date of redemption to October 1,
2014 (in the case of the 2017 Securities) or October 1, 2015 (in the case of the 2020 Securities) is less than one year, the weekly
average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

officers, respectively, or to whom any corporate trust matter is referred because of such person’s knowledge of and familiarity with
the particular subject and who shall have direct responsibility for the administration of this Indenture.

“Unrestricted Subsidiary” means any Subsidiary (other than the Company) of Parent that is designated by the Board of
Directors of Parent as an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to a Board Resolution, but only to the extent that such Subsidiary:

(1) has no Indebtedness other than Non-Recourse Debt;

(2) is not party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding with Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent
unless the terms of any such agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding are no less favorable to Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, taken as a whole, than those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not
Affiliates of Parent;

(3) is a Person with respect to which neither Parent nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect obligation
(a) to subscribe for additional Equity Interests or

Trustee a certified copy of the Board Resolution giving effect to such designation and an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such
designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 4.8 hereof. If, at any time, any Unrestricted
Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a
Restricted Subsidiary of Parent as of such date, and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under
Section 4.9 hereof, Parent will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of Parent may at any time designate any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.9 hereof, calculated on a pro forma basis
as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation.

“Vice President” when used with respect the Company or the Trustee, means any vice president, whether or not designated by
a number or a word or words added before or after the title “vice president.”

maturity or other required payments of principal, including payment at final maturity, in respect of the Indebtedness, by (b) the
number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth) that will elapse between such date and the making of such payment; by

THE SECURITIES

Section 2.1 Form and Dating. The Securities and the Trustee’s certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form set
forth in Exhibit A, which is incorporated in and made part of this Indenture. The Securities of each series may have notations,
legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage. The Company shall provide any such notations, legends or
endorsements to the Trustee in writing. The Securities shall be in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The Securities are being offered and sold by
the Company in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

-24

-----

(a) Restricted Global Securities. All of the Securities are initially being offered and sold to (i) qualified institutional buyers as
defined in Rule 144A (collectively, “QIBs” or individually, each a “QIB”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act or
(ii) outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act, and shall
be issued initially in the form of one or more Restricted Global Securities, which shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers
of the Securities represented thereby with the Trustee, as custodian for the depositary, The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”)
(such depositary, or any successor thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the “Depositary”), and registered in the name of its
nominee, Cede & Co., duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate
principal amount of the Restricted Global Securities may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on
the records of the Securities Custodian as hereinafter provided, subject in each case to compliance with the Applicable
Procedures.

(b) Form of Securities. Global Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 (in the case of the 2017 Securities)
and Exhibit A-2 (in the case of the 2020 Securities) attached hereto (including the Global Security Legend thereon and the
“Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Security” attached thereto). Definitive Securities shall be substantially in the
form of Exhibit A-1 (in the case of the 2017 Securities) and Exhibit A-2 (in the case of the 2020 Securities) attached hereto (but
without the Global Security Legend thereon and without the “Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Security”
attached thereto). Each Global Security shall represent such of the outstanding Securities as shall be specified therein and each
shall provide that it shall represent the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon
and that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or
increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges and redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount of
any increase or decrease in the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the
Trustee or the Securities Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, in accordance with instructions given by the Holder thereof
as required by Section 2.12 hereof and shall be made on the records of the Trustee and the Depositary.

Members of, or participants in, the Depositary (“Agent Members”) shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to
any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary or under the Global Security, and the Depositary (including, for this
purpose, its nominee) may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute
owner and Holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
(A) prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification,
proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or (B) impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the
operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Security.

(c) Additional Securities. Subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 4.9 hereof, the Company may issue
Additional Securities in an unlimited amount under this Indenture.

(d) Regulation S Global Securities. Securities offered and sold in reliance on Regulation S shall be issued in the form of the
Regulation S Global Security, which shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the Securities represented thereby with the
Trustee, as custodian for the Depositary, and registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary for the
accounts of designated agents holding on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,

-25

-----

duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Securities may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the
Trustee and the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, in connection with transfers of interest as hereinafter provided.

(e) Book Entry Provisions. The Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section 2.1(e),
authenticate and deliver initially one or more Global Securities of each series that (i) shall be registered in the name of the
Depositary or its nominee, (ii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary’s instructions
and (iii) shall bear legends substantially in the form of the first paragraph of Exhibit A-1 (in the case of the 2017 Securities)
attached hereto or the first paragraph of Exhibit A-2 (in the case of the 2020 Securities) attached hereto.

Section 2.2 Execution and Authentication. An Officer of the Company shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or
facsimile signature. Typographic and other minor errors or defects in any such facsimile signature shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any Security which has been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.

If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the
Security shall be valid nevertheless.

A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the
Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.

The Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery the 2017 Securities for original issue in an initial aggregate
principal amount of $500,000,000 and the 2020 Securities for original issue in an initial aggregate principal amount of
$700,000,000, in each case, upon receipt of a written order or orders of the Company signed by an Officer of the Company (a
“Company Order”). The Company Order shall specify the amount of Securities to be authenticated and shall provide that all such
Securities will be represented by a Restricted Global Security and the date on which each original issue of Securities is to be
authenticated. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the 2017 Securities and the 2020 Securities shall constitute a separate series
hereunder. The aggregate principal amount of each series of Securities outstanding at any time may not exceed the applicable
amounts in the foregoing sentence, except as provided in Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(d) and 2.7 hereof.

The Trustee shall act as the initial authenticating agent. Thereafter, the Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable
to the Company to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so.
Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent
shall have the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company.

The Securities shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in minimum denominations of $2,000
principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Section 2.3 Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain one or more offices or agencies where Securities may be
presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (each, a “Registrar”), one or more offices or agencies where Securities may
be presented for payment (each, a “Paying Agent”) and one or more offices or agencies where notices and demands to or upon the
Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company will at all times maintain a Paying Agent,
Registrar and an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the

-26

-----

Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. The
Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange.

The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement
shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and
address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service
of notices and demands in any place required by this Indenture, or fail to give the foregoing notice, the Trustee shall act as such.
The Company or any Affiliate of the Company may act as Paying Agent (except for the purposes of Section 4.1 and Article 8).

The Company hereby initially designates the Trustee as Paying Agent, Registrar and Securities Custodian, and the office or
agency of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (which shall initially be the office located at 101
Barclay Street — 8W, New York, NY 10286) as one such office or agency of the Company for each of the aforesaid purposes.

Section 2.4 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust. Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on each due date of the principal of
or interest on any Securities, the Company shall deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest, if
any, so becoming due. A Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by the
Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest, on the Securities, and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the
Company (or any other obligor on the Securities) in making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company
acts as Paying Agent, the Company or such Affiliate shall, before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on each due date of the
principal of or interest on any Securities, segregate the money and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may
require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee, and the Trustee may at any time during the continuance of any
Default, upon written request to a Paying Agent, require such Paying Agent to pay forthwith to the Trustee all sums so held in trust
by such Paying Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent (other than the Company) shall have no further liability for the money.

Section 2.5 Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list
available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the
Trustee on or before each interest payment date, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form
and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders.

Section 2.6 Transfer and Exchange.

(a) Subject to compliance with any applicable additional requirements contained in Section 2.12 hereof, when a Security is
presented to a Registrar with a request to register a transfer thereof or to exchange such Security for an equal principal amount of
Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested; provided,
_however, that every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or_
accompanied by an assignment form and, if applicable, a transfer certificate in the form(s) included in Exhibit A and Exhibit C, as
applicable, and in form satisfactory to the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing.
To permit registration of transfers and exchanges, upon surrender of any Security for registration of transfer or exchange at an
office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities
of a like aggregate principal amount at the Registrar’s request. Any exchange or transfer shall be without charge, except that the
Company or the Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to

-27

-----

cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto, and provided, that this sentence shall not apply
to any exchange pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.12(a), 3.6, 3.11 or 9.5 hereof.

Neither the Company, any Registrar nor the Trustee shall be required to exchange or register a transfer of any Securities or
portions thereof in respect of which a Change of Control Purchase Notice or a notice in connection with an Asset Sale Offer has
been delivered and not withdrawn by the Holder thereof (except, in the case of the purchase of a Security in part, the portion
thereof not to be purchased).

All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the
same debt and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

(b) Any Registrar appointed pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof shall provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee may
reasonably require in connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Securities upon transfer or exchange of Securities.

(c) Each Holder of a Security agrees to indemnify the Company and the Trustee against any liability that may result from the
transfer, exchange or assignment of such Holder’s Security in violation of any provision of this Indenture and/or applicable United
States federal, state, Canadian federal, provincial or territorial securities law.

Section 2.7 Replacement Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Company, a Registrar or the Trustee, or the
Company, a Registrar and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and
there is delivered to the Company, the applicable Registrar and the Trustee such security or indemnity as will be required by them
to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company, such Registrar or the Trustee that such Security has
been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute, and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like
tenor and principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to
be purchased by the Company pursuant to Article 3, the Company in their discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay or
purchase such Security, as the case may be.

Upon the issuance of any new Securities under this Section 2.7, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including
the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee or the Registrar) in connection therewith.

Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute
an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall
be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any
and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 2.7 are (to the extent lawful) exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights
and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

-28

-----

Section 2.8 Outstanding Securities. Securities of a series outstanding at any time are all Securities of such series authenticated
by the Trustee, except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation or surrendered for transfer or exchange and
those described in this Section 2.8 as not outstanding.

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Company receives proof
satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.

If a Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on a Redemption Date, Change of Control
Purchase Date or the Final Maturity Date money sufficient to pay the principal of (including premium, if any) and interest on
Securities (or portions thereof) payable on that date, then on and after such Redemption Date, Change of Control Purchase Date or
the Final Maturity Date, as the case may be, such Securities (or portions thereof, as the case may be) shall cease to be outstanding
and interest on them shall cease to accrue.

Subject to the restrictions contained in Section 2.9 hereof, a Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or
an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.

Section 2.9 Treasury Securities. In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities of a series
have concurred in any notice, direction, waiver or consent, Securities of such series owned by the Company or any other obligor
on the Securities or by any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor shall be disregarded, except that, for purposes of
determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such notice, direction, waiver or consent, only Securities of
such series which a Trust Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which
have been pledged in good faith shall not be disregarded if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee’s
right so to act with respect to the Securities and that the pledgee is neither the Company nor any other obligor on the Securities or
any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor.

Section 2.10 Temporary Securities. Until Definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and execute,
and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall
be substantially in the form of Definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company with the consent of the Trustee
considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities.

Section 2.11 Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and
the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee or its agent any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange, payment or
conversion. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel, in accordance with its standard procedures, all Securities surrendered for
transfer, exchange, payment, conversion or cancellation and shall deliver the canceled Securities to the Company. All Securities
which are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Final Maturity Date may be
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or resold. The Company may not hold or resell such Securities or issue any new Securities
to replace any Securities delivered for cancellation

Section 2.12 Legend; Additional Transfer and Exchange Requirements.

(a) If Securities are issued upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of Securities subject to restrictions on transfer and
bearing the legends set forth on the form of Securities attached hereto as Exhibit A (collectively, the “Legend”), or if a request is
made to remove the Legend on a Security, the

-29

-----

Securities so issued shall bear the Legend, or the Legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to the
Company such satisfactory evidence, which shall include an opinion of counsel if requested by the Company, as may be
reasonably required by the Company, that neither the Legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure
that transfers thereof comply with the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or that such Securities are not “restricted”
within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act; provided that no such evidence need be supplied in connection with the
sale of such Security pursuant to a registration statement that is effective at the time of such sale. Upon (i) provision of satisfactory
evidence if requested, or (ii) notification by the Company to the Trustee and Registrar of the sale of such Security pursuant to a
registration statement that is effective at the time of such sale, the Trustee, at the written direction of the Company, shall
authenticate and deliver a Security that does not bear the Legend. If the Legend is removed from the face of a Security and the
Security is subsequently held by an Affiliate of the Company, the Legend shall be reinstated.

(b) A Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any Person other than the Depositary or a nominee or any
successor thereof, and no such transfer to any such other Person may be registered; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit
any transfer of a Security that is issued in exchange for a Global Security but is not itself a Global Security; provided further that in
no event shall a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Security be transferred to a U.S. Person prior to the receipt by the
Registrar of any certificates required pursuant to Regulation S, as determined by the Company. No transfer of a Security to any
Person shall be effective under this Indenture or the Securities unless and until such Security has been registered in the name of
such Person. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, transfers of a Global Security, in whole or in
part, shall be made only in accordance with this section 2.12.

(c) Subject to the succeeding paragraph, every Security shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in the Legend.
Whenever any Restricted Security is presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange for a Security registered
in a name other than that of the Holder, such Security must be accompanied by a certificate in substantially the form set forth in
Exhibit A, dated the date of such surrender and signed by the Holder of such Security, as to compliance with such restrictions on
transfer. The Registrar shall not be required to accept for such registration of transfer or exchange any Security not so accompanied
by a properly completed certificate.

(d) The restrictions imposed by the Legend upon the transferability of any Security shall cease and terminate when such
Security has been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or transferred in compliance with
Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto) or, if earlier, upon the expiration of the holding period
applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(d)(1)(ii) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision). Any Security as to which
such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon a surrender of
such Security for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.12 (accompanied, in the event that
such restrictions on transfer have terminated by reason of a transfer in compliance with Rule 144 or any successor provision, by, if
requested by the Company or the Registrar, an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company and addressed to the
Company to the effect that the transfer of such Security has been made in compliance with Rule 144 or such successor provision),
be exchanged for a new Security, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the restrictive Legend. The
Company shall inform the Trustee of the effective date of any registration statement registering the Securities under the Securities
Act. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
aforementioned opinion of counsel or registration statement.

(e) As used in this Section 2.12, the term “transfer” encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer, hypothecation or other disposition
of any Security.

(f) The provisions of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) below shall apply only to Global Securities:

(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, a Global Security shall not be exchanged in
whole or in part for a Security registered in the name of any Person other than the Depositary or one or more nominees thereof,
_provided that a Global Security of a series may be exchanged for Securities of that series registered in the names of any person_
designated by the Depositary in the event that (A) the Depositary (x) has notified the obligors that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (y) such Depositary has ceased to be a “clearing agency” registered under the
Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not appointed by the obligors within 90 days after receipt of such
notice or the Company becomes aware of such failure of registration or (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
with respect to the Securities of that series. Any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (A) above shall be so exchanged
in whole and not in part, and any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (B) may be exchanged in whole or from time to
time in part as directed by the Depositary. Any Security issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be
a Global Security; provided that any such Security so issued that is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary
or a nominee thereof shall not be a Global Security.

(ii) Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be issued in definitive, fully registered
form, without interest coupons, shall have an aggregate principal amount equal to that of such Global Security or portion thereof
to be so exchanged, shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary shall designate
and shall bear the applicable legends provided for herein. Any Global Security to be exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by
the Depositary to the Trustee, as Registrar. With regard to any Global Security to be exchanged in part, either such Global
Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with
respect to such Global Security, the principal amount thereof shall be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so
exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee. Upon any such surrender or adjustment,
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Security issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an
authorized representative thereof.

(iii) Subject to the provisions of clause (v) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any
Person, including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a
Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.

(iv) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (i) above, the obligors will promptly make
available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Definitive Securities of the applicable series in definitive, fully registered form,
without interest coupons.

(v) Neither Agent members nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this
Indenture with respect to any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any
such Global Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and
any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the
Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such
nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any

-31

-----

other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the
exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.

(vi) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on
transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security
(including any transfers between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners in any Global Security) other than to require
delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so as and when
expressly required by, the terms or this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with
the express requirements hereof.

(g) Euroclear and Clearstream Procedures Applicable. The provisions of the “Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System”
and “Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear” and the equivalent procedures of Clearstream shall be applicable to
transfers of beneficial interests in Global Securities that are held by Participants through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Section 2.13 CUSIP and ISIN Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use one or more “CUSIP” and “ISIN”
numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use “CUSIP” and “ISIN” numbers in notices of purchase as a
convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such
numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a purchase and that reliance may be placed only on the
other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such purchase shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of
such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the “CUSIP” and “ISIN” numbers.

ARTICLE 3

REDEMPTION AND PURCHASES

Section 3.1 Right to Redeem. The Company, at its option, may redeem the Securities in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.7 hereof.

The Company may not redeem the Securities of a series if it has failed to pay any interest or premium on the Securities of such
series and such failure to pay is continuing.

If the Company elects to redeem the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date (unless a
shorter notice period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) of the Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities
and the series of such Securities to be redeemed and the Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Securities are being
redeemed.

Section 3.2 Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed. If less than all the outstanding Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the
Trustee shall select the Securities of that series for redemption as follows:

(1) if such Securities are listed on any securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities
exchange on which such Securities are listed; or

(2) if such Securities are not listed on any securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee
shall deem fair and appropriate.

-32

-----

In the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Securities to be redeemed will be selected, unless otherwise provided
herein, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee from the outstanding Securities of the
applicable series not previously called for redemption.

The Trustee will promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any
Security selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Securities and portions of Securities selected
will be in amounts of $2,000 or whole multiples of $1,000 except that if all of the Securities of a Holder are to be redeemed, the
entire outstanding amount of Securities held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to
portions of Securities called for redemption.

Section 3.3 Notice of Redemption. At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date, the Company shall
mail, or shall cause to be mailed, a notice of redemption by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Trustee and to each Holder of
Securities to be redeemed.

The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:

**•** the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed;

**•** the Redemption Date (which shall be a Business Day);

**•** the redemption price;

**•** the name and address of the Paying Agent;

**•** that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;

**•** if fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the certificate numbers, if any, and principal amounts of the

particular Securities to be redeemed;

**•** that, unless the Company defaults in the deposit of the redemption price, interest on Securities called for redemption will

cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date;

**•** the Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Securities are being redeemed; and

**•** the CUSIP numbers of the Securities.

At the Company’s request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company’s name and at the Company’s expense,
_provided that the Company makes such request at least three Business Days prior to the date by which such notice of redemption_
must be given to Holders in accordance with this Section 3.3. Concurrently with the mailing of any such notice of redemption, the
Company shall issue a press release announcing such redemption, the form and content of which shall be determined by the
Company. A notice of redemption may not be conditional. Redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a
Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Securities pursuant to Sections 8.3 or 8.4 or a
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Section 8.1.

Section 3.4 Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is given, Securities called for redemption become due
and payable on the Redemption Date and at the redemption price stated

-33

-----

in the notice. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice. If the
Redemption Date falls during a period starting after the close of business on an interest payment record date and ending on the
opening of business on the first Business Day after the next interest payment date, or if this interest payment date is not a Business
Day, the second Business Day after the interest payment date; then the interest payment will be payable to the Holders who present
the Securities for redemption.

On and after the Redemption Date, unless the Company defaults in the deposit of the redemption price, interest will cease to
accrue on the Securities or any portion of the Securities called for redemption, and all other rights of the Holder will terminate
other than the right to receive the redemption price, without interest from the Redemption Date, on surrender of the Securities.

Section 3.5 Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Redemption Date, the Company
shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price on all Securities to be redeemed
on that date.

Section 3.6 Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, without service charge, a new Security in an authorized denomination
equal in principal amount to, and in exchange for, the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

Holder promptly following the later of (a) the Change of Control Purchase Date with respect to such Security (provided the
conditions in Section 3.8(c) hereof have been satisfied) and (b) the time of delivery of such Security to a Paying Agent by the
Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 3.8(c) hereof.

of such Change of Control Purchase Date. The manner in which the deposit required by this Section 3.10 is made by the Company
shall be at the option of the Company, provided that such deposit shall be made in a manner such that the Trustee or a Paying
Agent shall have immediately available funds on the Change of Control Purchase Date.

If a Paying Agent holds, in accordance with the terms hereof, money sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price of
any Security for which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with this

Securities as to which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with this

a Paying Agent, and promptly after the Change of Control Purchase Date the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall

and in the manner specified therein. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change
of Control provisions of this Article 3, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not
be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Article 3 by virtue of such conflict.

Section 3.13 Repayment to the Company. To the extent that the aggregate amount of cash deposited by the Company pursuant
to Section 3.10 hereof exceeds the aggregate Change of Control Purchase Price (including interest thereon) of the Securities or
portions thereof that the Company is obligated to purchase, then promptly after the Change of Control Purchase Date, and upon
request, the Trustee or a Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall return any such excess cash to the Company.

Section 3.14 Offer to Purchase by Application of Excess Proceeds. In the event that, pursuant to Section 4.14 hereof, the
Company is required to commence an offer to all Holders to purchase Securities (“Asset Sale Offer”), it shall follow the
procedures specified below.

The Asset Sale Offer shall be made to all Holders of Securities and all holders of other indebtedness that is pari passu with the

**Date”), the Company shall apply a portion of the Excess Proceeds as calculated pursuant to Section 4.14 hereof (the “Offer**
**Amount”) to the purchase of Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness (on a pro rata basis, if applicable) or, if less than the**
Offer Amount has been tendered, all Securities and other Parity Indebtedness tendered in response to the Asset Sale Offer.
Payment for any Securities so purchased shall be made in the same manner as interest payments are made.

Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company shall send, by first-class mail, a notice to the Trustee and each of
the Holders. The notice will contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Securities pursuant to
the Asset Sale Offer. The notice, which will govern the terms of the Asset Sale Offer, will state:

Asset Sale Offer will remain open;

(2) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;

(3) that any Security not tendered or accepted for payment will continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless the Company defaults in making such payment, any Security accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale
Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Purchase Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have a Security purchased pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer may elect to have Securities purchased
in integral multiples of $1,000 only;

(6) that Holders electing to have a Security purchased pursuant to any Asset Sale Offer shall be required to surrender the
Security, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of the Security completed, or transfer by
book-entry transfer, to the Company, a Depositary, if appointed by the Company, or a Paying Agent at the address specified in
the notice at least three days before the Purchase Date;

(7) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives,
not later than the expiration of the Offer Period, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the
principal amount of the Security the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election
to have such Security purchased;

(8) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Securities and other Parity Indebtedness surrendered in connection with the
Asset Sale offer exceeds the Offer Amount, the Company

-39

-----

shall select the Securities and other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of
Securities of each series and such other Parity Indebtedness surrendered (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate
by the Company so that only Securities in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, will be purchased); and

(9) that Holders whose Securities of a particular series were purchased only in part will be issued new Securities of such
series equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities of such series surrendered (or transferred by bookentry transfer).

On or before the Purchase Date, the Company shall, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent
necessary, the Offer Amount of Securities or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the Offer
Amount has been tendered, all Securities tendered, and shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that such
Securities or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.14. The
Company, the Depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (but in any case not later than five days after the
Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Securities tendered by such
Holder and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company shall promptly issue a new Security of the applicable series,
and the Trustee, upon written request from the Company, shall authenticate and mail or deliver such new Security of the applicable
series to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Security of such series surrendered. Any
Security not so accepted shall be promptly mailed or delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof. The Company shall publicly
announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Purchase Date.

Other than as specifically provided in this Section 3.14, any purchase pursuant to this Section 3.14 shall be made pursuant to the
provisions of Sections 3.1 through 3.6 hereof.

funds in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and
private debts. Payments to any Holder holding an aggregate principal amount of Securities in excess of $1,000,000 shall be made
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account maintained by such Holder in the United States, if such Holder has
provided wire transfer instructions to the Company at least 10 Business Days prior to the payment date. Any wire transfer
instructions received by the Trustee will remain in effect until revoked by the Holder.

Section 4.2 Maintenance of Office or Agency.

(a) The Company shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency (which may be an
office of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee, Registrar or co registrar) where Securities may be surrendered for payment,
registration of transfer or for exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and
this Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the
location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail
to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.

(b) The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be
presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that
no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of
any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

(c) The Company hereby designates the office of the Trustee set forth in Section 2.3 hereof as one such office or agency of the
Company.

Section 4.3 Reports.

(a) Whether or not required by the SEC’s rules and regulations, so long as any Securities are outstanding, Parent shall furnish
(to the extent not publicly available on the SEC’s EDGAR system) to the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and post on
Parent’s website (in a format that is accessible to Holders of Securities as well as prospective Holders of Securities), within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations:

(i) all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if Parent were
required to file such reports; and

(ii) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if Parent were required to file such
reports.

All such reports shall be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and regulations applicable to such
reports (other than consolidating financial information required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X or any comparable provision so
long as Parent complies with Section 4.3(d)). Each annual report on Form 10-K shall include a report on Parent’s consolidated
financial statements by Parent’s certified independent accountants. In addition, Parent shall file a copy of each of the reports
referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above with the SEC for public availability within the time periods

-41

-----

specified in the rules and regulations applicable to such reports (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing) and make such
information available to securities analysts and prospective investors upon request. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent will be
required to provide the information described above regardless of whether it continues to file reports with the SEC.

(b) If, at any time, Parent is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any reason, Parent
shall nevertheless continue filing with the SEC and posting on its website the reports specified in Section 4.3(a) hereof with the
SEC within the time periods specified above unless the SEC will not accept such a filing. Parent agrees that it shall not take any
action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept any such filings. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept
the Parent’s filings for any reason, Parent shall post the reports referred to in Section 4.3(a) hereof on its website (and deliver them
to the Trustee) within the time periods that would apply if Parent were required to file those reports with the SEC.

(c) Parent further agrees that, for so long as any Securities remain outstanding, at any time it is not required to file the reports
required by Section 4.3(a) or (b) hereof with the SEC, it shall furnish to the Holders and to the Trustee and to securities analysts
and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act.

(d) The quarterly and annual financial information required by Sections 4.3(a), (b) and (c) hereof shall include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements, in the footnotes of the financial statements or in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations that discloses the total assets, liabilities, revenues and
income from operations of Subsidiaries of Parent (other than the Company) that do not Guarantee the Securities. The Trustee shall
not be responsible for determining whether clause 4.3(d) has been satisfied, nor shall it have any liability in connection therewith.

(e) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s
receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information
contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to
rely exclusively on Officers’ Certificates).

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent fails to comply with its obligation to file or provide
such information, documents and reports as required by this Section 4.3, Parent will be deemed to have cured such Default with
respect to a series of Securities for purposes of Section 6.1(d) upon the filing or provision of all such information, documents and
reports required hereunder prior to the expiration of 60 days after written notice to Parent of such failure from the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of such Securities.

Section 4.4 Compliance Certificates. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year
of the Company (beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010), an Officers’ Certificate as to the signer’s knowledge
of the Company’s compliance with all conditions and covenants on their part contained in this Indenture and stating whether or not
the signer knows of any Default or Event of Default. If such signer knows of such a Default or Event of Default, the Officers’
Certificate shall describe the Default or Event of Default and the efforts to remedy the same. For the purposes of this Section 4.4,
compliance shall be determined without regard to any grace period or requirement of notice provided pursuant to the terms of this
Indenture.

Section 4.5 Further Instruments and Acts. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company will execute and deliver such further
instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this
Indenture.

Section 4.6 Maintenance of Corporate Existence. Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Company will do or cause to be done all things
necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and the corporate existence of each Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve the corporate existence of any Restricted
Subsidiary if (a) the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the
conduct of the business of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse
in any material respect to the Holders of the Securities or (b) if a Subsidiary is to be dissolved, such Subsidiary has no assets.

Section 4.7 Changes in Covenants When Securities Rated Investment Grade. In the event of the occurrence of a Fall Away
Event (and notwithstanding the failure of Parent subsequently to maintain an Investment Grade Rating), the provisions of
Sections 4.8, 4.9, 4.12, 4.13 and 4.14 hereof and clause (iv) of Section 5.1(a) hereof will no longer be applicable to the Securities.

Section 4.8 Restricted Payments.

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(i) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of Parent’s or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation
involving Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Parent’s or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other
than Disqualified Stock) of Parent or to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent);

(ii) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger or

other acquisition or retirement of any such Indebtedness made in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal
installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such purchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement; or

(iv) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above being collectively referred to as “Restricted
**Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:**

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted
Payment;

(2) Parent would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted
Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in Section 4.9(a) hereof; and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by Parent and its

(xii) of Section 4.8(b)), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

(A) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of Parent (or prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company on a combined
basis) for the period (taken as one accounting period) from July 1, 2010 to the end of Parent’s most recently ended fiscal
quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated
Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit), plus

(B) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by Parent since the Issue Date as a contribution to its common
equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of Parent (other than Disqualified Stock) or from the issue or sale of
convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of Parent that have been
converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities)
sold to a Subsidiary of Parent), plus

(C) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is sold for cash or otherwise liquidated
or repaid for cash, the lesser of (i) the cash return of capital with respect to such Restricted Investment (less the cost of
disposition, if any) or (ii) the initial amount of such Restricted Investment, plus

(D) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Parent is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date,
the lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of Parent’s Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation or
(ii) such Fair Market Value as of the date on which such Subsidiary was originally designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

(b) The preceding provisions shall not prohibit:

(i) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend, if at the date of declaration the
dividend payment would have complied with the provisions of this Indenture (it being understood that the amount of any such
dividend shall be included in the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments determined in Section 4.8(a)(3) only once and not as
separate Restricted Payments made at both declaration and payment);

(ii) the redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition of any subordinated Indebtedness of the Company
or any Note Guarantor or of any Equity Interests of Parent in exchange for, or in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of the
substantially concurrent sale (other than to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent) of, Equity Interests of Parent (other than
Disqualified Stock) or other subordinated Indebtedness incurred under Section 4.9; provided, that (i) an amount equal to such
net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition will be
excluded from clause

-----

(3)(B) of Section 4.8(a) hereof and (ii) any such subordinated Indebtedness shall be Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;

employee, director, officer or consultant of, or service provider to, Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any
management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any principal and interest payable on any notes issued by Parent in connection with any such
repurchase, retirement or other acquisition), or any stock subscription or shareholder agreement, including any Equity Interest
rolled over by management of Parent in connection with the Transactions; provided that the aggregate amount of Restricted
Payments made under this clause (v) shall not exceed in any calendar year $25.0 million (with unused amounts for any year
being carried over to the next succeeding year, but not to any subsequent year, with the permitted amount for each year being
used prior to any amount carried over from the previous year); provided further that such amount in any calendar year may be
increased by an amount not to exceed:

Date; less

(ii) the amount of any Restricted Payments previously made with the cash proceeds described in subclause (i) of this
clause (v);

(vi) payments to holders of Equity Interests (or to the holders of Indebtedness that is convertible into or exchangeable for
Equity Interests upon such conversion or exchange) in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares;

(vii) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, cash settlement of the aggregate principal
amount (plus accrued interest and premium, if any) of the 4.0% Convertible Notes on or after the first optional redemption date
thereof upon conversion by the holders thereof; provided, however, that, in lieu of cash settling all or a portion of the 4.0%
Convertible Notes, Parent may repurchase shares of Parent’s common stock within six months of the first optional redemption
date for the 4.0% Convertible Notes, for aggregate consideration not to exceed the aggregate principal amount (plus accrued
interest and premium, if any) of the 4.0% Convertible Notes, in connection with the settlement of all or a portion of the 4.0%
Convertible Notes with Parent common stock;

(viii) any Restricted Payment made in connection with the consummation of the Transactions as described in the Offering
Circular (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Restricted Payments made to satisfy appraisal rights in connection with the
Merger) and the Post-Merger Special Dividend;

-45

-----

(ix) repurchases of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options or warrants if such Equity Interests
represent a portion of the exercise price of such options or warrants;

(x) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any subordinated Indebtedness pursuant to
provisions similar to those described under Section 3.8; provided that, prior thereto, all notes tendered by Holders in connection
with a Change of Control Offer have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value;

(xi) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration and payment of dividends to
holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries issued in accordance with Section 4.9;

that if the Total Leverage Ratio as of the date of any Restricted Payment to be made pursuant to this clause (xii) is greater than
or equal to 1.75 to 1.0, such Restricted Payment shall be permitted to be made pursuant to this clause (xii) only if the amount of
such Restricted Payment, when taken together with the amount of all other Restricted Payments previously made pursuant to
this clause (xii), does not exceed $400.0 million in the aggregate.

(c) The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the Fair Market Value (determined, for purposes of this
covenant, by Parent or, in the case of any asset(s) valued in excess of $40.0 million, by the Board of Directors of Parent, in each
case evidenced by an Officers’ Certificate delivered to the Trustee) on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or
securities proposed to be transferred or issued by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the
Restricted Payment. The Board of Directors’ determination shall be based upon an opinion or appraisal issued by an accounting,
appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing if the Fair Market Value of such non-cash assets exceeds $100.0 million.

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume,
guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise (collectively, “incur”), with respect to any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and Parent shall not issue any Disqualified Stock and shall not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock; provided, however, that Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue
preferred stock if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Parent’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a
pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock
or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

(b) Subsection (a) of this Section 4.9 shall not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(i) the incurrence by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding under this clause

Total Assets at any time outstanding;

or this clause (vi) or, solely to the extent of the excess (if any) of the amount of Indebtedness incurred and outstanding under
clause (i) of this Section 4.9(b) prior to the applicable refinancing over the maximum aggregate amount permitted to be incurred

(vii) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among Parent
and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:

(A) if the Company or a Note Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly
subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the Securities; and

(B) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person
other than Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person
that is not either Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such
Indebtedness by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that is not permitted by this clause (vii);

(viii) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are incurred in the ordinary
course of business and not for speculative purposes;

Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in
the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or
an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included
in Fixed Charges of Parent as accrued;

(xi) Obligations in respect of performance and surety bonds and completion guarantees provided by Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $100.0 million;

(xiii) the incurrence by any Foreign Subsidiary of Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding,
including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to
this clause (xiii), not to exceed the greater of (x) $250.0 million or (y) 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets;

Capital Stock of, or merger or consolidation with, any Person owning such assets); provided, however, on the date of such

2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would be greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such incurrence;

compensation claims, death, disability or other employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance, or
other Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement-type obligations regarding workers’ compensation claims; provided, however,
that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such obligations are reimbursed within
30 days following such drawing or incurrence;

Facilities, in a principal amount not in excess of the stated amount of such letter of credit;

(ii) take-or-pay obligations contained in supply arrangements, in each case, incurred in the ordinary course of business; and

(xix) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal
amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to

$250.0 million and (y) 2.5% of Consolidated Total Assets.

(c) Parent and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, incur any Indebtedness (including
Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of Parent, the Company or the
Subsidiary Guarantors unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Securities on
substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness of Parent, the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors shall
be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of Parent, the Company or any
Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or having a junior lien priority.

(d) For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.9, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (i) through (xix) of Section 4.9(b) hereof, or is
entitled to be incurred pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 4.9, Parent shall be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness
on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify from time to time all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that
complies with this Section 4.9. Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.9 need not be permitted solely by reference to one clause
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such clause and in part by one or more other clauses of this
Section 4.9 permitting such Indebtedness. Indebtedness under Credit Facilities outstanding on the date on which Securities are first
issued and authenticated under this Indenture will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception
provided by clause (i) of Section 4.9(b) hereof.

Section 4.10 [Reserved].

Section 4.11 Liens.

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any Lien of any kind on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, except Permitted Liens, unless
contemporaneously therewith:

provision is made to secure the Securities or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, equally and ratably with or prior to such
obligation with a Lien on the same assets of Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be; and

(ii) in the case of any Lien securing an obligation that is subordinated in right of payment to the Securities or a Note
Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Securities or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, with a Lien on the
same assets of Parent or

such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that is prior to the Lien securing such subordinated obligation.

Section 4.12 Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Company) to, directly or indirectly,

amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those
agreements, provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings are not more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment
restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the date of this Indenture;

(ii) this Indenture, the Securities and the Note Guarantees;

(iii) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Credit Facilities incurred under clause (i) of Section 4.9(b) hereof;

Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred, or such Capital
Stock was issued, in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not
applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person,
so acquired, provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred under Section 4.9 hereof;

advances by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(x) Permitted Liens securing Indebtedness that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(xi) customary provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements,

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any
transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an
“Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $10.0 million, unless:

(i) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary with
an unrelated Person; and

(ii) Parent delivers to the Trustee, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
involving aggregate consideration in excess of $50.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company set forth in
an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this Section 4.13(a) and that such Affiliate
Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Parent.

(b) The following items shall be deemed not to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of
Section 4.13(a) hereof:

(i) any employment agreement or benefit plan entered into by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with the past practice of Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary;

(viii) advances to employees in the ordinary course of business not to exceed $5.0 million in the aggregate at any one time
outstanding;

(ix) transactions with a Permitted Joint Venture in which Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary holds or acquires an ownership

and

(x) transactions in which Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the trustee a letter from an

Section 4.13(a)(i).

Section 4.14 Asset Sales.

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(i) Parent (or its Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal
to the Fair Market Value (determined, for purposes of this clause (i), by Parent or, in the case of any asset(s) valued in excess of
$75.0 million, by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case evidenced by an Officers’ Certificate delivered to the
Trustee) of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(ii) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash
or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(A) any liabilities, as shown on Parent’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Securities and the Note Guarantees)

-52

-----

that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to an agreement that releases Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary from further liability;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by Parent or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee
that are converted by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days after the consummation of the applicable
Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and

(C) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with all other
Designated Noncash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does not exceed at the time of the receipt of
such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of $100.0 million
or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets.

(b) Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary
may apply those Net Proceeds:

(i) to repay Indebtedness and other Obligations under (A) a Credit Facility and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit
Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, (B) other secured Indebtedness or (C) other
Indebtedness of a Subsidiary (other than the Company) that does not Guarantee the Securities, so long as the relevant assets
were assets of such Subsidiary (provided, in the case of (B), that such Indebtedness is not subordinated in right of payment to
the Securities);

(ii) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted Business;

(iii) to make payments with respect to the acquisition or license of intellectual property rights that are used in a Permitted
Business;

(iv) to make a capital expenditure in or that is useful in a Permitted Business;

(v) to retire Securities pursuant to privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases or otherwise; or

(vi) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets (for the avoidance of doubt, including acquisitions of inprocess research and development) under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business.

Notwithstanding Sections 4.14(a) and 4.14(b), Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply an amount
equal to any Net Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Proceeds from all Asset
Sales which are not applied in accordance with this covenant exceed the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total
Assets at the time of receipt of such Net Proceeds. Pending application of an amount equal to Net Proceeds pursuant to this
Section 4.14, Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net
Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture.

(c) Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.14(b) hereof shall constitute
“Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess

-53

-----

Proceeds exceeds the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, the Company shall make an offer (an “Asset
**Sale Offer”) to all Holders of Securities and all holders of Parity Indebtedness to purchase the maximum principal amount of**
Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in
any Asset Sale Offer shall be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and shall
be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of Securities and other Parity Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select the Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis.
Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

(d) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Securities
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale
provisions of this Indenture, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed
to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Section 4.15 Additional Subsidiary Guarantees. If any one of Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than the Company) that is not a
Subsidiary Guarantor Guarantees any Indebtedness of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, that Subsidiary shall (i) execute and
deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and, if such Subsidiary of Parent is a
Canadian Note Guarantor, a Canadian Note Guarantee, pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall unconditionally Guarantee, on a
senior unsecured (unless the Securities are secured pursuant to Section 4.11) basis, all of the Company’s obligations under the
Securities and this Indenture on the terms set forth in this Indenture and, if applicable, the Canadian Note Guarantee, and (ii)
deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
such Subsidiary and constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of such Subsidiary. Thereafter, such Subsidiary
shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes hereof until such Subsidiary Guarantee is released in accordance herewith.

Section 4.16 Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Parent’s Board of Directors may designate any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than the Company) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. Any
designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be a designation of each of such entity’s Subsidiaries
as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market
Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount
available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.8 hereof or under one or more of the clauses of the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” as determined by Parent. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time
and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Parent’s Board of Directors may
redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default and the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for Parent would be greater than immediately prior to such redesignation.

Section 4.17 Business Activities. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any
business other than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as would not be material to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

-54

-----

Section 4.18 Payments for Consent. Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of a series of Securities for or as an
inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture relating to such series of
Securities or such Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the Securities of such
series that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent,
waiver or agreement.

Section 4.19 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not
at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury
law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect
the covenants or the performance of this Indenture, and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives
all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenant that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the
execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no
such law had been enacted.

Section 4.20 [Reserved].

Section 4.21 Notice of Default. In the event that any Default or Event of Default under Section 6.1 hereof shall occur, the
Company shall give prompt written notice of such Default or Event of Default to the Trustee.

Section 4.22 Payment of Additional Amounts.

(a) All payments made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee by Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor organized other than
in the United States (each such person, a “Payor”) will be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for or on account
of any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature (collectively, “Tax”) imposed or levied
by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which such Payor is organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or through
which such Payor makes any payment on its Note Guarantee or any department or political subdivision of any of the foregoing
(each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless such Payor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. For the avoidance of
doubt, a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction shall not include the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia. If a Payor is
required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any
payment made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee, the Payor, subject to the exceptions listed below, will pay additional
amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Holder or beneficial owner
of the Securities after such withholding or deduction (including withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts
payable hereunder) will not be less than the amount the Holder or Beneficial Owner would have received if such Taxes had not
been withheld or deducted.

(b) A Payor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or Beneficial Owner of Securities:

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member or
shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial owner is an estate,
trust, partnership or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any

-55

-----

connection resulting from the acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of Securities, the receipt of payments thereunder or
under any Note Guarantee and/or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Securities or any Note Guarantee);

(ii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the failure of the
Holder or Beneficial Owner of Securities, following the Company’s or the Payor’s written request addressed to the Holder, to
the extent such Holder or Beneficial Owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes
imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or Beneficial Owner is
not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(iii) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales or any similar Taxes;

(iv) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the presentation by
the Holder or beneficial owner of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the
date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs
later;

(v) with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be
made pursuant to the European Council Directive on the taxation of savings income which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council
on June 3, 2003 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive (the “EU
**Savings Tax Directive”) or is required to be made pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss**
Confederation dated October 26, 2004 providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the EU Savings Tax Directive
(the “EU-Swiss Savings Tax Agreement”) or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or complying with, or
introduced in order to conform to, such agreement; or

(vi) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

(c) A Payor will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will make reasonable efforts to obtain certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes. The Payor will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld are due pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy or tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such
tax receipts are not reasonably available to the Payor, such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment
by the Payor.

(d) Prior to the date on which the payment of any Additional Amounts are due, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee such
Additional Amounts payable together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable on the
applicable payment date, and setting forth the Additional Amounts so payable and will also set forth such other information
necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the applicable payment date. Any such Officers’
Certificate will be delivered to the Trustee at least 5 Business Days in advance of when the payments in question are required to be
made (unless a shorter period of time is acceptable to the Trustee in its

-56

-----

reasonable discretion). The Payor will promptly publish a notice in accordance with Section 11.2 hereof stating that such
Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

(e) The Payors, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Holders of Securities, upon written request of such Holder of Securities
and certified proof of payment for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by
such Holder in connection with payments made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed
with respect to any reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such Holder
after such reimbursement will not be less than the net amount such Holder would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the
reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification obligation
provided for in this Section 4.22(e) shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the Holder of the Securities would not have been
eligible to receive payment of Additional Amounts hereunder by virtue of clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 4.22(b) hereof, or to
the extent such Holder received Additional Amounts with respect to such payments.

(f) In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges and
duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect of
the execution, issuance, registration or delivery of any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder
and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a result of, or in connection with,
(i) any payments made pursuant to the Securities, any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to
thereunder and/or (ii) the enforcement of any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder.

(g) The obligations described under this Section 4.22 will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and
will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to any Payor and to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia) in which such successor is organized, doing business or is otherwise resident for Tax purposes
or any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) from or through which payment is
made by such successor or its respective agents.

(h) Whenever this Indenture refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount
payable under or with respect to any Security or under any Note Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional
Amounts or other payments that would be payable pursuant to this Section 4.22, if applicable.

beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in Section 4.9(a) hereof or (b) Parent or the Person formed by or surviving any such

Guaranteed by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after
the date of this Indenture, if that default:

-59

-----

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal when due on such Indebtedness within any applicable grace period provided in such
Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

hereof with respect to Parent or the Company) with respect to any series of Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, by
notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then
outstanding may, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, declare all unpaid principal to the date of acceleration on the
Securities of such series then outstanding (if not then due and payable) to be due and payable upon any such declaration, and the
same shall become and be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in clause (h) or (i) of Section 6.1 hereof
with respect to Parent or the Company occurs, all unpaid principal (including, without limitation, any premium, if any), and
accrued interest, if any, on the Securities of such series then outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the applicable series of Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its
consequences with respect to that series if (a) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of the
applicable series of Securities which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived; (b) to
the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest at a rate of 1% per annum over the amount of interest otherwise payable
on such Securities on overdue installments of interest and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such
declaration of acceleration, has been paid; (c) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction; and (d) all payments due to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 7.7 hereof have been
made. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereto.

Section 6.3 Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to,
pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of the principal of or interest on the
Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of such Securities or this Indenture.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the
proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of
Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is
exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.4 Waiver of Defaults and Events of Default. Subject to Sections 6.7 and 9.2 hereof, the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a series then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or
Event of Default and its consequences with respect to such series of Securities, except a Default or Event of Default in the payment
of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Securities of such series when due or any Default or Event of Default in
respect of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities of such series which, under Section 9.2 hereof, cannot be modified or
amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security of such series affected. When a Default or Event of Default is waived,
it is cured and ceases.

Section 6.5 Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of each affected series of Securities
then outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy or power
available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it with respect to such series of Securities. However, the
Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly
prejudicial to the rights of another Holder of Securities of that series or the Trustee, or that may involve the Trustee in personal
liability unless the Trustee is offered indemnity satisfactory to it; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action
deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

Section 6.6 Limitations on Suits. A Holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or a series of Securities
(except actions for payment of overdue principal, premium, if any, or interest) unless:

(a) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;

(b) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of the applicable series make
a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(c) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable indemnity to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and

(e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of the applicable series.

A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or
priority over such other Securityholder.

Section 6.7 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any
Holder of a Security to receive payment of the principal of, or interest on the Security, on or after the respective due dates
expressed in the Security and this Indenture and to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective
dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.

Section 6.8 Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default in the payment of principal or interest specified in clause (a) or
(b) of Section 6.1 hereof occurs and is continuing with respect to any Securities, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or another obligor on the Securities for the whole amount of principal
and accrued interest remaining unpaid, together with, to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue
principal and overdue installments of interest, in each case at a rate equal to the interest rate then in effect on such Security plus
1% per annum and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

Section 6.9 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may
be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the

-62

Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor
on the Securities), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any money or other
property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is
hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the
making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 7.7 hereof, and to the extent that such payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances in
any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of,
any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other property which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such
proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained
shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to, or, on behalf of any Holder, to authorize, accept or adopt any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to
authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

Section 6.10 Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following
order:

_First, to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.7 hereof;_

_Second, to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest ratably, without preference or_
priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest respectively; and

_Third, the balance, if any, to the Company._

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.

Section 6.11 Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit
against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party
litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good
faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit made by the Trustee, a suit by a
Holder pursuant to Section 6.7 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a
series then outstanding.

resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.

Section 7.3 Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee
of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company with the same rights it would have if it

-----

Section 7.4 Trustee’s Disclaimer. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the
Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company’s use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for
any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication.

Section 7.5 Notice of Default or Events of Default. If a default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is
known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it
is known by the Trustee. However, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good
faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of Securityholders, except in the case of a Default or an Event of Default
in payment of the principal (including premium, if any) of or interest on any Security.

beginning with the May 15 following the date of this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder a brief report dated as of such
May 15 that complies with TIA Section 313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA Sections 313(b)(2) and (c).

A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the SEC and each

listed on any stock exchange or listed or admitted to trading on any quotation system and any changes in the stock exchanges or
quotation systems on which the Securities are listed or admitted to trading and of any delisting thereof.

Section 7.7 Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation (as

(other than taxes based upon, measured by or determined by the income of the Trustee), (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture or any action or
failure to act as authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon the Trustee hereunder including the
reasonable costs and expenses of the Trustee and its counsel in defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the

are hereby made subordinate on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except such money or property held in trust
to pay the principal of and interest on the Securities. The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.7 shall survive the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or the resignation or removal of the Trustee.

-66

-----

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) of Section 6.1
hereof occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any
Bankruptcy Law to the extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture.

Section 7.8 Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and may, with
the Company’s written consent, appoint a successor Trustee. The Company may remove the Trustee if:

(a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;

(b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent;

(c) a Custodian or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or

(d) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of the Trustee for any reason, the Company shall
promptly appoint a successor Trustee. The resignation or removal of a Trustee shall not be effective until a successor Trustee shall
have delivered the written acceptance of its appointment as described below.

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 45 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee,
the Company or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee at the expense of the Company.

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof, any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company.
Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee and be released
from its obligations (exclusive of any liabilities that the retiring Trustee may have incurred while acting as Trustee) hereunder, the
resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and
duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to each Holder.

A retiring Trustee shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any successor Trustee after its succession.

Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Company’s obligations under Section 7.7 hereof
shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

Section 7.9 Successor Trustee by Merger, Etc. If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or
substantially all of its corporate trust assets (including the administration of this Indenture) to, another corporation, the resulting,
surviving or transferee corporation, without any further act, shall be the successor Trustee, provided such transferee corporation
shall qualify and be eligible under Section 7.10 hereof. Such successor Trustee shall promptly mail notice of its succession to the
Company and each Holder.

excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to

such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable);

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series of Securities on the date of the
deposit or will occur as a result of the deposit and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of or constitute a default

the other parties thereto are senior to those of the Holders;

(c) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder with respect to such series of Securities by
the Company; and

-68

-----

(d) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all
conditions precedent herein relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series of Securities
have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under
Section 7.7 hereof shall survive and, if cash, non-callable U.S. government securities or a combination thereof shall have been
deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (ii) of clause (a) of this Section, the provisions of Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7,

this Indenture shall no longer be in effect with respect to a series of Securities (“Legal Defeasance”), and the Trustee, at the
expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same, except for the following provisions, which

(a) the Company shall have irrevocably deposited with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of such series of
Securities, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as shall be sufficient, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest and premium, if
any, on the outstanding Securities of such series on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable Redemption Date, as the case may
be, and the Company must specify whether the Securities are being defeased to their Stated Maturity or to a particular
Redemption Date;

(b) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (based on a ruling published by the United States

acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the Holders of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(c) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to such series of Securities either:
(i) on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or an Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to
such deposit) or (ii) insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at the time in the period
ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit;

Restricted Subsidiary is bound;

(e) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company

(f) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all
conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance have been complied with.

After any such irrevocable deposit, the Trustee upon request shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company’s
obligations under the applicable series of Securities and this Indenture except for those surviving obligations in the immediately
preceding paragraph.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by Section 8.2(b) hereof with respect to a Legal Defeasance
need not be delivered if all Securities of the applicable series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (1) have
become due and payable or (2) shall become due and payable upon maturity or redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

breach of clauses (c), (d), (e), or (f), or with respect to Significant Subsidiaries only, clauses (h) or (i) under Section 6.1 hereof
shall be deemed not to be an Event of Default with respect to such series (“Covenant Defeasance”), if in each case with respect to
such series of the outstanding Securities:

(a) the Company shall have irrevocably deposited with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of such series of
Securities, cash in U.S. dollars, Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as shall be sufficient, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest and premium, if
any, on the outstanding Securities of such series on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable Redemption Date, as the case may
be, and the Company must specify whether the Securities are being defeased to their Stated Maturity or to a particular
Redemption Date;

(b) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to
such Trustee confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the Covenant Defeasance had not
occurred;

(c) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to such series of Securities either:
(i) on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to
such deposit) or (ii) insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at the time in the period

-----

(d) the Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement
or instrument (other than this Indenture with respect to such series of Securities) to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;

(e) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company
with the intent of preferring the Holders of Securities over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and

(f) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all
conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance have been complied with.

If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the
applicable series of Securities when due, then the obligations of the Company and the Note Guarantors under this Indenture will be
revived and no such defeasance will be deemed to have occurred.

Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Defeasance, the Trustee shall send written notice of such Covenant Defeasance to the
Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by Section 8.3(b) hereof with respect to a Covenant
Defeasance need not be delivered if all Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (1) have become due and
payable or (2) shall become due and payable upon maturity or redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

Section 8.4 Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.5 hereof, the Trustee or a Paying Agent shall
hold in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of a particular series of Securities, all money deposited with it pursuant to Section 8.1,
8.2 or 8.3 hereof and shall apply the deposited money in accordance with this Indenture and the applicable series of Securities to
the payment of the principal of and interest on such series of Securities.

Section 8.5 Repayment to the Company. The Trustee and each Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company upon request
any excess money (i) deposited with them pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 hereof and (ii) held by them at any time.

The Trustee and each Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of
principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years after a right to such money has matured; provided, however, that the
Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such payment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be
mailed to each Holder entitled to such money notice that such money remains unclaimed and that after a date specified therein,
which shall be at least 30 days from the date of such mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid
to the Company. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled to money must look to the Company for payment as general
creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.

Section 8.6 Reinstatement. If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 8.5
hereof by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting such

-71

-----

application, then the Company’s obligations under this Indenture and the applicable series of Securities shall be revived and
reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 hereof until such time as the Trustee or such
Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.5 hereof; provided,
_however, that if the Company has made any payment of the principal of or interest on any Securities because of the reinstatement_
of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive any such payment
from the money or Government Securities held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent.

(c) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities of such series;

does not adversely affect the legal rights under this Indenture of any such Holder;

(e) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;

(f) to conform the text of this Indenture or the Securities to any provision of the section of the Offering Circular dated

recitation of a provision of this Indenture or the Securities;

(g) to provide for the issuance of Additional Securities in accordance with the limitations set forth in this Indenture as of the
date hereof;

(h) to add additional Note Guarantees with respect to the Securities of such series or to confirm and evidence the release,

of the Securities of such series then outstanding may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision

-72

-----

notice to any Holder. However, notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 9.4 hereof, without the written consent of each
Holder of Securities of a series affected hereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver, including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.4
hereof, may not:

(a) reduce the principal amount of such Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(b) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any such Security or alter the provisions with respect to the
redemption of such Securities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, provisions relating to Sections 3.8, 3.14 and 4.14);

(c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any such Security;

(d) make any such Security payable in money other than U.S. dollars;

(e) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of such

by Sections 3.8, 3.14 and 4.14);

(g) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Securities;

(h) modify the Note Guarantees with respect to such Securities in any manner adverse to the Holders of such Securities; or

(i) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions with respect to such series of Securities.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under Section 9.1 or this Section 9.2 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to
the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail
such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement
or waiver.

Section 9.3 [Reserved].

Section 9.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by
a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences
the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such
Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the notice of
revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.

-73

-----

After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder of the applicable series, unless it
makes a change described in any of clauses (a) through (i) of Section 9.2 hereof. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver
shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security
that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Security.

Section 9.5 Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the
Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the
Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the
Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.

Section 9.6 Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc. The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplemental indenture authorized
pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplemental indenture does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, in its sole discretion, but need not sign it. In signing or refusing to sign such
amendment or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject to Section 7.1 hereof, shall be fully
protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted
by this Indenture and all conditions precedent in this Indenture to such execution have been complied with. The Company may not
sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until its Board of Directors approves it.

Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all
purposes; and every Holder of Securities of the applicable series theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder
shall be bound thereby.

NOTE GUARANTEES

Section 10.1 Note Guarantees.

(a) Each of the Note Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally Guarantees to each Holder of a Security
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and
enforceability of this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder that: (i) the due and
punctual payment of principal, premium and interest on the Securities shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity,
by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, (ii) the due and punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal of and interest on
the Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture or any
Security shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, and (iii) in case of any
extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that same shall be promptly paid in full
when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so
guaranteed for whatever reason, the Note Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each
Note Guarantor shall agree that this is a Guarantee of payment and not a Guarantee of collection.

-74

-----

(b) Each of the Note Guarantors hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to its Guarantee shall be joint and several,
unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this
Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor
with respect to this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the Securities, any action to
enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense of a Note Guarantor. Each Note Guarantor further, to the extent permitted by law, shall waive and
relinquish all claims, rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors and shall agree not to assert or take advantage
of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (i) any right to require any of the Trustee, the Holders or the
Company (each a “Benefited Party”), as a condition of payment or performance by such Note Guarantor, to (A) proceed against
the Company, any other guarantor (including any other Note Guarantor) of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or any other
person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Company, any such other guarantor or any other person,
(C) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Benefited Party in favor of
the Company or any other person, or (D) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Benefited Party whatsoever; (ii) any defense
arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of the Company including any defense based
on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or any agreement or
instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of the Company from any cause other than payment in full
of the obligations under the Note Guarantees; (iii) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the
obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (iv) any
defense based upon any Benefited Party’s errors or omissions in the administration of the obligations under the Note Guarantees,
except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (v) (A) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might
be in conflict with the terms of the Note Guarantees and any legal or equitable discharge of such Note Guarantor’s obligations
hereunder and under its Note Guarantee, (B) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Note Guarantor’s liability
hereunder and under its Note Guarantee or the enforcement hereof and thereof, (C) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and
counterclaims and (D) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Benefited Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any
security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (vi) notices, demands, presentations, protests, notices of protest, notices of
dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of the Note Guarantees, notices of default under the Securities
or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the obligations under the Note
Guarantees or any agreement related thereto, and notices of any extension of credit to the Company and any right to consent to any
thereof; (vii) to the extent permitted under applicable law, the benefits of any “One Action” rule; and (viii) any defenses or benefits
that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict
with the terms of the Note Guarantees. Except as set forth in Section 10.5, each Note Guarantor shall covenant that its Note
Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in its Note Guarantee and this
Indenture.

(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or
any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Note Guarantors, any
amount paid to either the Trustee or such Holder, any Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full
force and effect.

(d) Each Note Guarantor shall agree that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect
of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Note Guarantor shall further
agree that, as between the Note Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of
the

-75

-----

obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 hereof for the purposes of any Guarantee,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed
hereby and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 6.2 hereof, such
obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Note Guarantors for the purpose of
any such Guarantee. The Note Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so
long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the applicable Guarantee.

Section 10.2 Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantees. To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.1 hereof, each Note
Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto shall be endorsed by
an officer of such Note Guarantor on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be
executed on behalf of such Note Guarantor by any of its Officers. Each of the Note Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby agrees
that its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.1 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on
each Security a notation of such Note Guarantee. If an officer or Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Note
Guarantee of a Note Guarantor no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security on which the Note
Guarantee of such Note Guarantor is endorsed, the Note Guarantee of such Note Guarantor shall be valid nevertheless. The
delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Note
Guarantees set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Note Guarantors.

Section 10.3 Limitation on Note Guarantor Liability. Each Note Guarantor shall confirm, and by its acceptance of Securities,
each Holder hereby confirms, that it is the intention of all such parties that any Guarantee of such Note Guarantor not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar applicable law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing
intention, the Trustee and the Holders irrevocably agree, and the Note Guarantors shall irrevocably agree, that the obligations of
such Note Guarantor under this Article 10 shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum
amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Note Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving
effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Note Guarantor in
respect of the obligations of such other Note Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Section 10.4 Merger and Consolidation of Note Guarantors.

(a) In case of any sale or other disposition, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor
person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note
Guarantee endorsed upon the Securities and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this
Indenture to be performed by the Note Guarantor, such successor person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Note Guarantor
with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Note Guarantor. Such successor person thereupon may cause to be signed
any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Securities available hereunder which theretofore shall not have
been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same
legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of
this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

-76

-----

(b) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clause (a) of this Section 10.4, nothing contained in this
Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Note Guarantor with or into the Company or
another Note Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Note Guarantor as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety to the Company or another Note Guarantor.

Section 10.5 Release.

(a) In the event (i) of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of
merger, amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transactions) a Subsidiary of Parent, so
long as the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.14 hereof, (ii) of a designation by Parent of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the definition thereof, (iii) upon the release or discharge of
any Note Guarantee in respect of any Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the Issue Date of the Note Guarantee by such
Subsidiary Guarantor or (iv) the Company discharges this Indenture under Section 8.1 or exercises its legal or covenant defeasance
options under Section 8.2 or 8.3, respectively, such Subsidiary Guarantor or, in the case of a sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Person acquiring such property, shall be released and relieved of
any obligations under its Guarantee without any further action being required by the Trustee or any Holder. If the Company
discharges this Indenture under Section 8.1 or exercises its legal or covenant defeasance options under Section 8.2 or 8.3,
respectively, Parent shall be released and relieved of any obligations under its Note Guarantee without any further action being
required by the Trustee or any Holder.

(b) Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including without
limitation Section 4.8 hereof, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any
Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee.

(c) Any Note Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of
principal of and interest on the Securities and for the other obligations of any Note Guarantor under this Indenture as provided in
this Article 10.

Trustee for the benefit of the Holders.

against any loss incurred by such party as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company, Parent or
any Subsidiary Guarantor for any U.S. dollar amount due under this Indenture and such judgment or order being expressed and
paid in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than U.S. dollars and as a result of any variation as between (i) the rate of
exchange at which the U.S. dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and
(ii) the spot rate of exchange in The City of New York at which such party on the date of payment of such judgment or order is

denominated in a foreign currency will be the Dollar Equivalent calculated on the date the Indebtedness was incurred or other
transaction was entered into; provided that if any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than U.S.
dollars is incurred to refinance Indebtedness denominated in the same currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness shall be deemed not to exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Indenture, no restriction or amount will be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies.

4. INDENTURE, LIMITATIONS

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 6.75% Senior Notes due 2017 (the
“Notes”), issued under an Indenture dated as of September 28, 2010 (together with any supplemental indentures thereto, the
“Indenture”), among Parent, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of this Note include those stated
in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, as in effect on
the date of the Indenture. This Note is subject to all such terms, and the Holder of this Note is referred to the Indenture and said
Act for a statement of them. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the meanings assigned to such terms in the
Indenture.

The Company shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Indenture.

5. OPTIONAL REDEMPTION; PURCHASE OF NOTES AT OPTION OF HOLDER.

(a) Optional Redemption. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at the prices, and upon the terms and
conditions, set forth in Section 3.7 of the Indenture.

(b) Repurchase at Option of Holder. If there is a Change of Control, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a
“Change of Control Offer”) to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of
each Holder’s Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the
Company shall mail a notice to each Holder setting forth the procedures governing the Change of Control Offer as required by the
Indenture.

If after Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary consummates any Asset Sale, the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the
greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, the Company shall commence an offer to all Holders of Notes and
all holders of other Parity Indebtedness to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other Parity
Indebtedness that may be purchased (or repaid, prepaid or redeemed) equal to the aggregate Excess Proceeds (an “Asset Sale
**Offer”) pursuant to Section 4.14 of the Indenture to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and other Parity**
Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such
offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other
Parity Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, Parent (or such Restricted
Subsidiary) may use such deficiency for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount
of Notes and other Parity Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof

exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select the Notes and other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a
_pro rata basis. Holders of Notes that are the subject of an offer to purchase will receive an Asset Sale Offer from the Company_

to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of the Notes.

(d) Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the
redemption date to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations larger than
$2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be
redeemed. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

6. DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE, CANCELLATION

The Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof. A Holder may register the transfer of or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a
Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes or other
governmental charges that may be imposed in relation thereto by law or permitted by the Indenture.

All Notes surrendered for payment, registration of transfer or exchange or conversion will, if surrendered to the Company or
any of its other Agents with respect to the Notes, be delivered to the Trustee. The Trustee will promptly cancel all Notes delivered
to it. No Notes will be authenticated in exchange for any Notes cancelled, except as provided in the Indenture.

7. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS

The Holder of a Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

8. UNCLAIMED MONEY

If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay the
money back to the Company at its written request, subject to applicable unclaimed property law. After that, Holders entitled to
money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates
another person.

9. AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture (with respect to the Notes) or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and an existing default or
Event of Default and its consequence or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived in a particular
instance with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Without the
consent of or notice to any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture (with respect to the
Notes) or the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or make any other change that does not
adversely affect the rights of any Holder.

Under the Indenture, an Event of Default includes: (i) default in payment of any principal (including, without limitation, any
premium) on the Notes when due; (ii) default for 30 days in payment of interest on any Notes; (iii) failure by Parent or any of its

principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare all unpaid principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, to
the date of acceleration on the Notes then outstanding to be due and payable immediately, all as and to the extent provided in the
Indenture. If an Event of Default occurs as a result of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Parent or the
Company, unpaid principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the Notes then outstanding shall become due and
payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, all as and to the extent provided
in the Indenture. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require
indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee
may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines
that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company is required to file periodic reports with the Trustee as to the absence of
default.

The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity,
may make loans to, accept deposits from and perform services for the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and may otherwise
deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company as if it were not the Trustee.

A director, officer, employee or shareowner, as such, of the Company or any Note Guarantor shall not have any liability for any
obligations of the Company or any Note Guarantor under the Notes or the Indenture nor for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. The Holder of this Note by accepting this Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of this Note.

in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, as in effect on
the date of the Indenture. This Note is subject to all such terms, and the Holder of this Note is referred to the Indenture and said

The Company shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Indenture.

(a) Optional Redemption. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at the prices, and upon the terms and
conditions, set forth in Section 3.7 of the Indenture.

(b) Repurchase at Option of Holder. If there is a Change of Control, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a
“Change of Control Offer”) to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of

redemption date to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations larger than

money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates
another person.

consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and an existing default or
Event of Default and its consequence or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived in a particular
instance with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Without the

principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare all unpaid principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, to

payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, all as and to the extent provided
in the Indenture. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require
indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee
may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines
that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company is required to file periodic reports with the Trustee as to the absence of
default.

obligations of the Company thereunder that: (i) the due and punctual payment of principal, premium and interest on the
Securities shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, (ii) the due

-----

(b) Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to its Canadian Note Guarantee shall be unconditional, irrespective of

the validity or enforceability of the Securities or the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, the absence of any action
to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor with respect to the Indenture, the
Securities or the obligations of the Company under the Indenture or the Securities, any action to enforce the same or any other
circumstances (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of
a guarantor. Guarantor further, to the extent permitted by applicable law, hereby waives and relinquishes all claims, rights and
remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors and shall agree not to assert or take advantage of any such claims, rights or
remedies, including but not limited to: (i) any right to require any Beneficiary, as a condition of payment or performance by
Guarantor, to (A) proceed against the Company, any other guarantor (including any other Note Guarantor) of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any other person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Company, any such other guarantor
or any other person, (C) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any
Beneficiary in favour of the Company or any other person, or (D) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Beneficiary
whatsoever; (ii) any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of the
Company including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of the Company from
any cause other than payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law
which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than
that of the principal; (iv) any defense based upon any Beneficiary’s errors or omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed
Obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (v) (A) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise,
which are or might be in conflict with the terms of this Canadian Note Guarantee and any legal or equitable discharge of
Guarantor’s obligations hereunder and under this Canadian Note Guarantee, (B) the benefit of any statute of limitations
affecting Guarantor’s liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (C) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims

or lien or any property subject thereto; (vi) notices, demands, presentations, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and
notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of this Canadian Note Guarantee, notices of default under the Securities
or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any agreement related thereto, and notices of any extension of credit to the Company and any right to consent
to any thereof; and (vii) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or
exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of this Canadian Note Guarantee.

(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, any Note Guarantor or any

custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or any Note Guarantor, any
amount paid to either the Trustee or such Holder, this Canadian Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
reinstated in full force and effect.

(d) Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations

guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor further agrees that, as between Guarantor, on
the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations may be
accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 of the Indenture for the purposes of this Canadian Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any
stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) in the event
of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 6.2 of the Indenture, such obligations (whether or
not due

D-3


-----

and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by Guarantor for the purpose of this Canadian Note Guarantee. Guarantor

shall not exercise any right to seek contribution from any non-paying Note Guarantor if the exercise of such right impairs the
rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantees.

**2.2. Merger and Consolidation of Guarantors**

(a) In case of any sale or other disposition, consolidation, merger, amalgamation or conveyance and upon the assumption by the

successor person on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Trustee of the obligations of Guarantor under this Canadian Note
Guarantee, and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be performed by
Guarantor, such successor person shall succeed to and be substituted for Guarantor under this Canadian Note Guarantee with
the same effect as if it had been named herein as Guarantor.

(b) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 of the Indenture, and notwithstanding clause (a) of this Section 2.2, nothing contained in

the Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation, merger or amalgamation of a Note Guarantor with or
into the Company or another Note Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Note Guarantor as
an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Note Guarantor.

**2.3. Release**

(a) In the event (i) of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Guarantor, by way of merger,

amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all the Equity Interests of any Guarantor, in each
case to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transactions) a Subsidiary of Parent, so long as the Net
Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including
without limitation Section 4.14 thereof, (ii) of a designation by Parent of Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the definition thereof, (iii) upon the release or discharge of this Canadian Note Guarantee in respect of any
Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the Issue Date of this Canadian Note Guarantee by Guarantor or (iv) the
Company discharges the Indenture under Section 8.1 thereof or exercises its legal or covenant defeasance options under
Section 8.2 or 8.3 thereof, respectively, Guarantor or, in the case of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of Guarantor, the Person acquiring such property, shall be released and relieved of any obligations under this Canadian
Note Guarantee without any further action being required by the Trustee or any Holder.

(b) Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale

or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, including without
limitation Section 4.8 thereof, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of
Guarantor from its obligations under this Canadian Note Guarantee.

**Section 3.**

**MISCELLANEOUS**

**3.1. Limitations Act, 2002 (Ontario)**

Any and all limitation periods provided for in the Limitations Act, 2002 (Ontario), as amended from time to time, or any other
applicable law limiting the time for which an action may be commenced shall be

D-4


-----

excluded from application to the obligations of Guarantor hereunder to fullest extent permitted by such Act or applicable law.

**3.2. Usury Savings Clause**

If any provision of this Canadian Note Guarantee, the Indenture or any Security would obligate any Canadian Note Guarantor to
make any payment of or on account of interest or other amount in an amount or calculated at a rate which would result in a receipt
by any Holder of interest at a criminal rate (as such term is construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then notwithstanding
such provisions, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate
of interest, as the case may be, as would not so result in a receipt by such Holder of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to
be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1) firstly, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such
Holder, and (2) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to such Holder
which would constitute “interest” for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada).

**3.3. Interest Act (Canada)**

For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or
fees provided for in this Canadian Note Guarantee, the Indenture or the Securities (and stated herein or therein, as applicable, to be
computed on the basis of a 360 day year or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent are the rates so
provided for multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 360 or the actual number of
days in such other period of time, respectively.

**3.4. Counterparts; Execution**

This Canadian Note Guarantee may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts,
each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute but one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Canadian Note Guarantee facsimile or other
similar method of electronic transmission (including by way of email attachment) shall be equally as effective as delivery of an
original executed counterpart of this Canadian Note Guarantee.

**3.5. Severability**

If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Canadian Note Guarantee or its application to any party or circumstance is restricted,
prohibited or unenforceable, such provision shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such restriction,
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Canadian Note Guarantee and without
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or without affecting its application to other parties
or circumstances.

**3.6. Notices**

All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, sent, or delivered in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture.

**3.7. Successors**

This Canadian Note Guarantee shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and shall inure to the benefit of the successors
of the Beneficiaries.

D-5


-----

**3.8. Judgment Currency**

Guarantor shall indemnify each Holder and each Person, if any, who controls any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any loss incurred by such party as a result of any judgment or order being
given or made against Guarantor for any U.S. dollar amount due under this Canadian Note Guarantee and such judgment or order
being expressed and paid in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than U.S. dollars and as a result of any variation as
between (i) the rate of exchange at which the U.S. dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such
judgment or order and (ii) the spot rate of exchange in The City of New York at which such party on the date of payment of such
judgment or order is able to purchase U.S. dollars with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such party if
such party had utilized such amount of Judgment Currency to purchase U.S. dollars upon such party’s receipt thereof. Any amount
due from Guarantor under this Section 3.8 shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by such judgment or order as
aforesaid. The term “spot rate of exchange” shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the
purchase of, or conversion into, U.S. dollars.

**3.9. Payment of Additional Amounts**

(a) All payments made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee by Guarantor will be made free and clear of any

withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of
whatever nature (collectively, “Tax”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of Canada or any department or political subdivision
thereof (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless Guarantor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If
Guarantor is required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
from any payment made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee, Guarantor, subject to the exceptions listed
below, will pay additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by
each Holder or beneficial owner of the Securities after such withholding or deduction (including withholding or deduction
attributable to Additional Amounts payable hereunder) will not be less than the amount the Holder or beneficial owner would
have received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted.

(b) Guarantor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or Beneficial Owner of Securities:

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the existence of any

present or former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member
or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any connection resulting from the
acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of Securities, the receipt of payments thereunder or under this Canadian
Note Guarantee and/or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Securities or this Canadian Note Guarantee);

(ii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the failure of the

Holder or Beneficial Owner of Securities, following Guarantor’s written request addressed to the Holder, to the extent such
Holder or Beneficial Owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification, information or
other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed
by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a

D-6


-----

certification that the Holder or Beneficial Owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(iii) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales or any similar Taxes;

(iv) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the presentation by

the Holder or beneficial owner of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days
after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for,
whichever occurs later;

(v) with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be made

pursuant to the European Council Directive on the taxation of savings income which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council
on June 3, 2003 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive (the “EU
**Savings Tax Directive”) or is required to be made pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and the**
Swiss Confederation dated October 26, 2004 providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the EU Savings Tax
Directive (the “EU-Swiss Savings Tax Agreement”) or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or
complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such agreement; or

(vi) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

(c) Guarantor will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted

or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. Guarantor will make reasonable efforts to
obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. Guarantor will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld are due pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy or tax receipts
evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts are not reasonably available to Guarantor, such other documentation that
provides reasonable evidence of such payment by Guarantor.

(d) Prior to the date on which the payment of any Additional Amounts are due, Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee such

Additional Amounts payable together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable on
the applicable payment date, and setting forth the Additional Amounts so payable and will also set forth such other
information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the applicable payment date. Any
such Officers’ Certificate will be delivered to the Trustee at least 5 Business Days in advance of when the payments in
question are required to be made (unless a shorter period of time is acceptable to the Trustee in its reasonable discretion).
Guarantor will promptly publish a notice in accordance with Section 11.2 of the Indenture stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

(e) Guarantor will reimburse the Holders of Securities, upon written request of such Holder of Securities and certified proof of

payment for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such Holder in
connection with payments made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed
with respect to any reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such
Holder after such reimbursement will not be less than the net amount such Holder would have received if the Taxes giving rise
to the reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification

D-7


-----

obligation provided for in this Section 3.9(e) shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the Holder of the Securities would

not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional Amounts hereunder by virtue of clauses (i) through (vi) of
Section 3.9(b) hereof, or to the extent such Holder received Additional Amounts with respect to such payments.

(f) In addition, Guarantor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges and

duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect
of the execution, issuance, registration or delivery of this Canadian Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument
referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a
result of, or in connection with, (i) any payments made pursuant to the Securities, any Guarantee or any other such document
or instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the enforcement of this Canadian Note Guarantee or any other such document
or instrument referred to thereunder.

(g) The obligations described under this Section 3.9 will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and

will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to Guarantor and to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia) in which such successor is organized, doing business or is otherwise resident for Tax
purposes or any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) from or through which
payment is made by such successor or its respective agents.

(h) Whenever this Canadian Note Guarantee refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any

other amount payable under or with respect to any Security or under this Canadian Note Guarantee, such reference includes
the payment of Additional Amounts or other payments that would be payable pursuant to this Section 3.9, if applicable.
