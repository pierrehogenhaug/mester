(2) is not party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding with the Company or any Restricted

the time from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Company;

(3) is a Person with respect to which neither the Company nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has any direct or

Officers’ Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 4.8
hereof. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it

Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such
Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.9 hereof, calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the

THE SECURITIES

Section 2.1 Form and Dating. The Securities and the Trustee’s certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form

set forth in Exhibit A, which is incorporated in and made part of this Indenture. The Securities may have notations, legends or
endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage. The Company shall provide any such notations, legends or
endorsements to the Trustee in writing. The Securities shall be in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The Securities are being offered and sold by
the Company in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

(a) Restricted Global Securities. All of the Securities are initially being offered and sold to (i) qualified institutional

buyers as defined in Rule 144A (collectively, “QIBs” or individually, each a “QIB”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act or (ii) outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the
Securities Act, and shall be issued initially in the form of one or more Restricted Global Securities, which shall be deposited
on behalf of the purchasers of the Securities represented thereby with the Trustee, as custodian for the depositary, The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) (such depositary, or any successor thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
“Depositary”), and registered in the name of its nominee, Cede & Co., duly executed by the Company and authenticated by
the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate principal amount of the Restricted Global Securities may from time to time
be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Securities Custodian as hereinafter provided, subject in
each case to compliance with the Applicable Procedures.

(b) Form of Securities. Global Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (including the

Global Security Legend thereon and the “Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Security” attached thereto).
Definitive Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (but without the Global Security Legend
thereon and without the “Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global Security” attached thereto). Each Global Security
shall represent such of the outstanding Securities as shall be specified therein and each shall provide that it shall represent the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate principal
amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or

-24

-----

of any increase or decrease in the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by
the Trustee or the Securities Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, in accordance with instructions given by the Holder
thereof as required by Section 2.12 hereof and shall be made on the records of the Trustee and the Depositary.

Members of, or participants in, the Depositary (“Agent Members”) shall have no rights under this Indenture with

respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary or under the Global Security, and the Depositary
(including, for this purpose, its nominee) may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the
Trustee as the absolute owner and Holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall (A) prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving
effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or (B) impair, as between the
Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of
any Security.

(c) Additional Securities. Subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 4.9 hereof, the Company may issue

Additional Securities in an unlimited amount under this Indenture.

(d) Regulation S Global Securities. Securities offered and sold in reliance on Regulation S shall be issued in the form of

the Regulation S Global Security, which shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the Securities represented thereby
with the Trustee, as custodian for the Depositary, and registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of the
Depositary for the accounts of designated agents holding on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, duly executed by the
Company and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate principal amount of the Regulation S
Global Securities may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the
Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, in connection with transfers of interest as hereinafter provided.

(e) Book Entry Provisions. The Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section 2.1(e),

authenticate and deliver initially one or more Global Securities that (i) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its
nominee, (ii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary’s instructions and (iii) shall
bear legends substantially in the form of the first paragraph of Exhibit A attached hereto.

Section 2.2 Execution and Authentication. An Officer of the Company shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual

or facsimile signature. Typographic and other minor errors or defects in any such facsimile signature shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any Security which has been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.

If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the

Security shall be valid nevertheless.

A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on

the Security. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.

-25

-----

amount of $900,000,000 upon receipt of a written order of the Company signed by an Officer of the Company (a “Company
**Order”). The Company Order shall specify the amount of Securities to be authenticated and shall provide that all such Securities**
will be represented by a Restricted Global Security and the date on which each original issue of Securities is to be authenticated.
The aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding at any time may not exceed the applicable amounts in the foregoing
sentence, except as provided in Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(d) and 2.7 hereof.

The Trustee shall act as the initial authenticating agent. Thereafter, the Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent

acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee
may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An
authenticating agent shall have the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company.

The Securities shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in minimum denominations of $2,000

principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Section 2.3 Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain one or more offices or agencies where Securities may

be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (each, a “Registrar”), one or more offices or agencies where Securities
may be presented for payment (each, a “Paying Agent”) and one or more offices or agencies where notices and demands to or
upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company will at all times maintain a Paying
Agent, Registrar and an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this
Indenture may be served in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities
and of their transfer and exchange.

The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture. The agreement

shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and
address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar, Paying Agent or agent for service
of notices and demands in any place required by this Indenture, or fail to give the foregoing notice, the Trustee shall act as such.
The Company or any Affiliate of the Company may act as Paying Agent (except for the purposes of Section 4.1 and Article 8).

The Company hereby initially designates the Trustee as Paying Agent, Registrar and Securities Custodian, and the office or

agency of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (which shall initially be the office located at 101
Barclay Street - 8W, New York, NY 10286) as one such office or agency of the Company for each of the aforesaid purposes.

Section 2.4 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust. Prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on each due date of the principal

of or interest on any Securities, the Company shall deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest, if
any, so becoming due. A Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by the
Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest, on the Securities, and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the
Company (or any other obligor on the Securities) in making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company
acts as Paying Agent, the Company or such Affiliate shall, before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on each due date of the
principal of or interest on any Securities, segregate the money and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may
require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee, and the Trustee may at any time during the continuance of any
Default, upon written request to a Paying Agent, require such Paying Agent to pay forthwith to the

-26

-----

further liability for the money.

Section 2.5 Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent

list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to
the Trustee on or before each interest payment date, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such
form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders.

Section 2.6 Transfer and Exchange.

(a) Subject to compliance with any applicable additional requirements contained in Section 2.12 hereof, when a Security is

presented to a Registrar with a request to register a transfer thereof or to exchange such Security for an equal principal amount of
Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested; provided,
_however, that every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed or_
accompanied by an assignment form and, if applicable, a transfer certificate in the form(s) included in Exhibit A and Exhibit C, as
applicable, and in form satisfactory to the Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing.
To permit registration of transfers and exchanges, upon surrender of any Security for registration of transfer or exchange at an
office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities
of a like aggregate principal amount at the Registrar’s request. Any exchange or transfer shall be without charge, except that the
Company or the Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in relation thereto, and provided, that this sentence shall not apply to any exchange pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.12(a), 3.6,
3.11 or 9.5 hereof.

Neither the Company, any Registrar nor the Trustee shall be required to exchange or register a transfer of any Securities or

portions thereof in respect of which a Change of Control Purchase Notice or a notice in connection with an Asset Sale Offer has
been delivered and not withdrawn by the Holder thereof (except, in the case of the purchase of a Security in part, the portion
thereof not to be purchased).

All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the

same debt and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

(b) Any Registrar appointed pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof shall provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee may

reasonably require in connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Securities upon transfer or exchange of Securities.

(c) Each Holder of a Security agrees to indemnify the Company and the Trustee against any liability that may result from the

transfer, exchange or assignment of such Holder’s Security in violation of any provision of this Indenture and/or applicable United
States federal, state, Canadian federal, provincial or territorial securities law.

Section 2.7 Replacement Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Company, a Registrar or the Trustee, or

the Company, a Registrar and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and
there is delivered to the Company, the applicable Registrar and the Trustee such security or indemnity as will be required by them
to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company, such Registrar or the Trustee that such Security has
been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute, and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or

-27

-----

contemporaneously outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about

to be purchased by the Company pursuant to Article 3, the Company in their discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay
or purchase such Security, as the case may be.

Upon the issuance of any new Securities under this Section 2.7, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to

cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including
the reasonable fees and expenses of the Trustee or the Registrar) in connection therewith.

Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall

constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 2.7 are (to the extent lawful) exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights

and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Section 2.8 Outstanding Securities. Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee, except

for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation or surrendered for transfer or exchange and those described in this
Section 2.8 as not outstanding.

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Company receives proof

satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.

If a Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds on a Redemption Date, Change of Control

Purchase Date or the Final Maturity Date money sufficient to pay the principal of (including premium, if any) and interest on
Securities (or portions thereof) payable on that date, then on and after such Redemption Date, Change of Control Purchase Date or
the Final Maturity Date, as the case may be, such Securities (or portions thereof, as the case may be) shall cease to be outstanding
and interest on them shall cease to accrue.

Subject to the restrictions contained in Section 2.9 hereof, a Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company

or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.

Section 2.9 Treasury Securities. In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have

concurred in any notice, direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities or
by any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor shall be disregarded, except that, for purposes of determining whether the
Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such notice, direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which a Trust Officer of the
Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith shall not
be disregarded if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee’s right so to act with respect to the Securities
and that the pledgee is neither the Company nor any other obligor on the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or of such
other obligor.

-28

-----

and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall
be substantially in the form of Definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company with the consent of the Trustee
considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver Definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities.

Section 2.11 Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and

the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee or its agent any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange, payment or
conversion. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel, in accordance with its standard procedures, all Securities surrendered for
transfer, exchange, payment, conversion or cancellation and shall deliver the canceled Securities to the Company. All Securities
which are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Final Maturity Date may be
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or resold. The Company may not hold or resell such Securities or issue any new Securities
to replace any Securities delivered for cancellation

Section 2.12 Legend; Additional Transfer and Exchange Requirements.

(a) If Securities are issued upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of Securities subject to restrictions on transfer and

bearing the legends set forth on the form of Securities attached hereto as Exhibit A (collectively, the “Legend”), or if a request is
made to remove the Legend on a Security, the Securities so issued shall bear the Legend, or the Legend shall not be removed, as
the case may be, unless there is delivered to the Company such satisfactory evidence, which shall include an opinion of counsel if
requested by the Company, as may be reasonably required by the Company, that neither the Legend nor the restrictions on transfer
set forth therein are required to ensure that transfers thereof comply with the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
that such Securities are not “restricted” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act; provided that no such evidence
need be supplied in connection with the sale of such Security pursuant to a registration statement that is effective at the time of
such sale. Upon (i) provision of satisfactory evidence if requested, or (ii) notification by the Company to the Trustee and Registrar
of the sale of such Security pursuant to a registration statement that is effective at the time of such sale, the Trustee, at the written
direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver a Security that does not bear the Legend. If the Legend is removed from
the face of a Security and the Security is subsequently held by an Affiliate of the Company, the Legend shall be reinstated.

(b) A Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any Person other than the Depositary or a nominee or any

successor thereof, and no such transfer to any such other Person may be registered; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit
any transfer of a Security that is issued in exchange for a Global Security but is not itself a Global Security; provided further that in
no event shall a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Security be transferred to a U.S. Person prior to the receipt by the
Registrar of any certificates required pursuant to Regulation S, as determined by the Company. No transfer of a Security to any
Person shall be effective under this Indenture or the Securities unless and until such Security has been registered in the name of
such Person. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, transfers of a Global Security, in whole or in
part, shall be made only in accordance with this section 2.12.

(c) Subject to the succeeding paragraph, every Security shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in the Legend.

Whenever any Restricted Security is presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange for a Security registered
in a name other than that of the Holder, such Security must be accompanied by a certificate in substantially the form set forth in
Exhibit A, dated the date of such surrender and signed by the Holder of such Security, as to compliance with such

-29

-----

so accompanied by a properly completed certificate.

(d) The restrictions imposed by the Legend upon the transferability of any Security shall cease and terminate when such

Security has been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or transferred in compliance with
Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto) or, if earlier, upon the expiration of the holding period
applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(d)(1)(ii) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision). Any Security as to which
such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon a surrender of
such Security for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.12 (accompanied, in the event that
such restrictions on transfer have terminated by reason of a transfer in compliance with Rule 144 or any successor provision, by, if
requested by the Company or the Registrar, an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company and addressed to the
Company to the effect that the transfer of such Security has been made in compliance with Rule 144 or such successor provision),
be exchanged for a new Security, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the restrictive Legend. The
Company shall inform the Trustee of the effective date of any registration statement registering the Securities under the Securities
Act. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
aforementioned opinion of counsel or registration statement.

(e) As used in this Section 2.12, the term “transfer” encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer, hypothecation or other disposition

of any Security.

(f) The provisions of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) below shall apply only to Global Securities:

(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, a Global Security shall not be exchanged in

whole or in part for a Security registered in the name of any Person other than the Depositary or one or more nominees
thereof, provided that a Global Security may be exchanged for Securities registered in the names of any person designated by
the Depositary in the event that (A) the Depositary (x) has notified the obligors that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
Depositary for such Global Security or (y) such Depositary has ceased to be a “clearing agency” registered under the
Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not appointed by the obligors within 90 days after receipt of such
notice or the Company becomes aware of such failure of registration or (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing with respect to the Securities. Any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (A) above shall be so exchanged
in whole and not in part, and any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (B) may be exchanged in whole or from time
to time in part as directed by the Depositary. Any Security issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof
shall be a Global Security; provided that any such Security so issued that is registered in the name of a Person other than the
Depositary or a nominee thereof shall not be a Global Security.

(ii) Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be issued in definitive, fully

registered form, without interest coupons, shall have an aggregate principal amount equal to that of such Global Security or
portion thereof to be so exchanged, shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the
Depositary shall designate and shall bear the applicable legends provided for herein. Any Global Security to be exchanged in
whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee, as Registrar. With regard to any Global Security to be exchanged
in part, either such Global Security shall be so surrendered for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the
Depositary or its nominee with respect to such Global Security, the principal amount thereof shall be reduced, by an amount
equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment

-30

-----

Security issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof.

(iii) Subject to the provisions of clause (v) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any

Person, including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a
Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.

(iv) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (i) above, the obligors will promptly make

available to the Trustee a reasonable supply of Definitive Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest
coupons.

(v) Neither Agent members nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under

this Indenture with respect to any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under
any such Global Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the
Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all
purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of
the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the
Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other
Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons governing the
exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.

(vi) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions

on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security
(including any transfers between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners in any Global Security) other than to require
delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so as and when

Section 2.13 CUSIP and ISIN Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use one or more “CUSIP” and “ISIN”

REDEMPTION AND PURCHASES

Section 3.1 Right to Redeem. The Company, at its option, may redeem the Securities in accordance with the provisions of

Section 3.7 hereof.

The Company may not redeem the Securities if it has failed to pay any interest or premium on the Securities and such failure

to pay is continuing.

If the Company elects to redeem the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date

(unless a shorter notice period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) of the Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of the
Securities to be redeemed and the Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Securities are being redeemed.

Section 3.2 Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed. If less than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee

shall select the Securities for redemption as follows:

(1) if such Securities are listed on any securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal

securities exchange on which such Securities are listed or pursuant to the applicable procedures of DTC; or

(2) if such Securities are not listed on any securities exchange, by lot or pursuant to the applicable procedures of DTC.

In the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Securities to be redeemed will be selected, unless otherwise provided

herein, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee from the outstanding Securities not
previously called for redemption.

The Trustee will promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any

Security selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Securities and portions of Securities selected
will be in amounts of $2,000 or whole multiples of $1,000 except that if all of the Securities of a Holder are to be redeemed, the
entire outstanding amount of Securities held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed. Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to
portions of Securities called for redemption.

Section 3.3 Notice of Redemption. At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date, the Company shall

mail, or shall cause to be mailed, a notice of redemption by first-class mail, postage prepaid, (or otherwise transmit in accordance
with applicable procedures of DTC) to the Trustee and to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed.

The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:

   - the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed;

   - the Redemption Date (which shall be a Business Day);

   - the redemption price;

   - the name and address of the Paying Agent;

-32

-----

   - if fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the certificate numbers, if any, and principal amounts of

the particular Securities to be redeemed;

   - that, unless the Company defaults in the deposit of the redemption price, interest on Securities called for redemption will

cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date;

   - the Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Securities are being redeemed; and

   - the CUSIP numbers of the Securities.

At the Company’s request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company’s name and at the Company’s expense,
_provided that the Company makes such request at least three Business Days prior to the date by which such notice of redemption_
must be given to Holders in accordance with this Section 3.3. Concurrently with the mailing of any such notice of redemption, the
Company shall issue a press release announcing such redemption, the form and content of which shall be determined by the
Company. A notice of redemption may not be conditional. Redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a
Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Securities pursuant to Sections 8.3 or 8.4 or a
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Section 8.1.

Section 3.4 Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is given, Securities called for redemption become due

and payable on the Redemption Date and at the redemption price stated in the notice. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such
Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice. If the Redemption Date falls during a period starting after the
close of business on an interest payment record date and ending on the opening of business on the first Business Day after the next
interest payment date, or if this interest payment date is not a Business Day, the second Business Day after the interest payment
date; then the interest payment will be payable to the Holders who present the Securities for redemption.

On and after the Redemption Date, unless the Company defaults in the deposit of the redemption price, interest will cease to

accrue on the Securities or any portion of the Securities called for redemption, and all other rights of the Holder will terminate
other than the right to receive the redemption price, without interest from the Redemption Date, on surrender of the Securities.

Section 3.5 Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Redemption Date, the Company

shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price on all Securities to be redeemed
on that date.

Section 3.6 Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute

and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, without service charge, a new Security in an authorized denomination
equal in principal amount to, and in exchange for, the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

Section 3.7 Optional Redemption.

(a) At any time prior to December 1, 2016, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the

Offerings; provided that:

(1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (including the Securities issued after the Issue Date,

if any) issued under this Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding the
Securities held by the Company and its Subsidiaries); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

(b) On or after December 1, 2016, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Securities upon not less than 30 nor more

than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and
unpaid interest on the Securities redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on December 1 of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2016 102.813%

2017 101.406%

2018 and thereafter 100.000%

(c) In addition, at any time prior to December 1, 2016, the Company may redeem the Securities, in whole or in part, at a

redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Securities redeemed plus the Applicable Premium plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of redemption.

(d) In connection with any optional redemption of the Securities, any such redemption may, at the Company’s discretion, be

subject to one or more conditions precedent.

(e) If the Company or any Note Guarantor becomes obligated to pay, on the next date on which any amount will be payable

with respect to the Securities, any Additional Amounts as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in Section 4.22 herein), which amendment or change is publicly announced and
becomes effective after the date hereof (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on
a date after the date hereof, after such later date) or (ii) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or
application of such laws or regulations (including by virtue of a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction) which amendment or
change is publicly announced and becomes effective after the date hereof (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the date hereof, after such later date) (each of the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), a “Change in Tax Law”) and the Company or applicable Note Guarantor cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking
reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a paying agent located in another jurisdiction, but not
including the substitution of an obligor if the Company would be required to pay Additional Amounts), the Company may, at its
option, redeem the Securities then outstanding, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), provided however that if such right to redeem is
triggered by the obligation of a Note Guarantor to pay Additional Amounts, such right to redeem will apply only if the payment
giving rise to such obligation cannot be made by the Company or another Note Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts. Notice of the Company’s intent to redeem the Securities shall not be given until the Company delivers to the Trustee an
opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the

entitle the Company to redeem the Securities hereunder and an Officers’ Certificate to the effect that the Company or applicable
Note Guarantor cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it. The
foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to the Company or applicable Note Guarantor, after
such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law that is publicly announced and
becomes effective after such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture.

(f) The Company will give not less than 30 days’ nor more than 60 days’ notice of any redemption; provided that the notice

pursuant to the previous paragraph shall not be provided (i) earlier than 90 days before the next date on which the Company or
applicable Note Guarantor would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts and (ii) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, selection of the
Securities for redemption will be made:

(i) in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are

listed, or

(ii) if the Securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, by lot or pursuant to applicable depositary

procedures.

(g) Any redemption pursuant to this Section 3.7 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.1 through 3.6 hereof.

(h) In connection with any Redemption under this Section 3.7, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers’

“Change of Control Purchase Notice”) to any Paying Agent at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day next
preceding the Change of Control Purchase Date.

The delivery of such Security to any Paying Agent (together with all necessary endorsements) at the office of such Paying

(e) The Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the

Purchase Notice specified in Section 3.8(c) hereof, the Holder of the Security in respect of which such change of Control Purchase
Notice was given shall (unless such Change of Control Purchase Notice is withdrawn as specified below) thereafter be entitled to
receive the Change of Control Purchase Price with respect to such Security. Such Change of Control Purchase Price shall be paid

conditions in Section 3.8(c) hereof have been satisfied) and (b) the time of delivery of such Security to a Paying Agent by the
Holder thereof in the manner required by Section 3.8(c) hereof.

A Change of Control Purchase Notice may be withdrawn by means of a written notice (which may be delivered by mail,

overnight courier, hand delivery, facsimile transmission or in any other written form and, in the case of Global Securities, may be
delivered electronically or by other means in accordance with the Depositary’s customary procedures) of withdrawal delivered by
the Holder to a Paying Agent at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Change of

Indenture then, on the Change of Control Purchase Date, interest will cease to accrue on such Securities or any portion of the
Securities as to which a Change of Control Purchase Notice has been tendered and not withdrawn in accordance with this

pursuant to Section 3.10 hereof exceeds the aggregate Change of Control Purchase Price (including interest thereon) of the
Securities or portions thereof that the Company is obligated to purchase, then promptly after the Change of Control Purchase Date,
and upon request, the Trustee or a Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall return any such excess cash to the Company.

Section 3.14 Offer to Purchase by Application of Excess Proceeds. In the event that, pursuant to Section 4.14 hereof, the

Company is required to commence an offer to all Holders to purchase Securities (“Asset Sale Offer”), it shall follow the
procedures specified below.

The Asset Sale Offer shall be made to all Holders of Securities and all holders of other indebtedness that is pari passu with

withdrawing his election to have such Security purchased;

(8) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Securities and other Parity Indebtedness surrendered in connection with the

Asset Sale offer exceeds the Offer Amount, the Company shall select the Securities and other Parity Indebtedness to be

COVENANTS

Section 4.1 Payment of Securities. The Company shall promptly make all payments in respect of the Securities on the dates

and in the manner provided in the Securities and this Indenture. An installment of principal or interest shall be considered paid on
the date it is due if the Paying Agent (other than the Company) holds by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that date money,
deposited by the Company or an Affiliate thereof, sufficient to pay the installment. Except in the case of a redemption, a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer, accrued and unpaid interest on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any interest payment date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security is registered at the close of
business on the record date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose. The Company
shall (in immediately available funds), to the fullest extent permitted by law, pay interest on overdue principal (including premium,
if any) and overdue installments of interest from the original due date to the date paid, at the rate applicable to the Security plus
1% per annum, which interest shall be payable on demand.

The Company will make payments in respect of the Securities represented by the Global Securities (including principal,

premium, if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder of the Global
Security. The Company will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Definitive Securities by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Definitive Securities, in the case of a
Holder holding an aggregate principal amount of notes of $1,000,000 or more, or, if no such account is specified or in the case of a
Holder holding an aggregate principal amount of notes of less than $1,000,000, by mailing a check to each such Holder’s
registered address. All payments shall be made in immediately available funds in such coin or currency of the United States of
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments to any Holder holding an
aggregate principal amount of Securities in excess of $1,000,000 shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
an account maintained by such Holder in the United States, if such Holder has provided wire transfer instructions to the Company
at least 10 Business Days prior to the payment date. Any wire transfer instructions received by the Trustee will remain in effect
until revoked by the Holder.

Section 4.2 Maintenance of Office or Agency.

(a) The Company shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency (which may be an

office of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee, Registrar or co

-40

-----

registrar) where Securities may be surrendered for payment, registration of transfer or for exchange and where notices and
demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company
shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.

(b) The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be

presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that
no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the
Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of
any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

(c) The Company hereby designates the office of the Trustee set forth in Section 2.3 hereof as one such office or agency of

the Company.

Section 4.3 Reports.

(a) Whether or not required by the SEC’s rules and regulations, so long as any Securities are outstanding, the Company shall

furnish (to the extent not publicly available on the SEC’s EDGAR system) to the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and post on
the Company’s website (in a format that is accessible to Holders of Securities as well as prospective Holders of Securities), within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations:

(i) all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the

Company were required to file such reports; and

(ii) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Company were required to file

such reports.

All such reports shall be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and regulations applicable to such

reports (other than consolidating financial information required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X or any comparable provision so
long as the Company complies with Section 4.3(d)). Each annual report on Form 10-K shall include a report on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements by the Company’s certified independent accountants. In addition, the Company shall file a copy
of each of the reports referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above with the SEC for public availability within the time periods specified
in the rules and regulations applicable to such reports (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing) and make such information
available to securities analysts and prospective investors upon request. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will be required
to provide the information described above regardless of whether it continues to file reports with the SEC.

(b) If, at any time, the Company is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any

reason, the Company shall nevertheless continue filing with the SEC and posting on its website the reports specified in
Section 4.3(a) hereof with the SEC within the time periods specified above unless the SEC will not accept such a filing. The
Company agrees that it shall not take any action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept any such filings. If,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept the Company’s filings for any reason, the Company shall post the reports
referred to in Section 4.3(a) hereof on its website within the time periods that would apply if the Company were required to file
those reports with the SEC.

(c) The Company further agrees that, for so long as any Securities remain outstanding, at any time it is not required to file the

reports required by Section 4.3(a) or (b) hereof with the SEC, it shall furnish to the Holders and to securities analysts and
prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act.

(d) The quarterly and annual financial information required by Sections 4.3(a), (b) and (c) hereof shall include a reasonably

detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements, in the footnotes of the financial statements or in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations that discloses the total assets, liabilities, revenues and
income from operations of Subsidiaries of the Company that do not Guarantee the Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible
for determining whether clause 4.3(d) has been satisfied, nor shall it have any liability in connection therewith.

(e) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s

receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information
contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to
rely exclusively on Officers’ Certificates).

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the Company fails to comply with its obligation to file or

provide such information, documents and reports as required by this Section 4.3, the Company will be deemed to have cured such
Default for purposes of Section 6.1(d) upon the filing or provision of all such information, documents and reports required
hereunder prior to the expiration of 60 days after written notice to the Company of such failure from the Trustee or the Holders of
at least 25% of the principal amount of such Securities.

Section 4.4 Compliance Certificates. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 90 days after the end of each fiscal

year of the Company (beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013), an Officers’ Certificate as to the signer’s
knowledge of the Company’s compliance with all conditions and covenants on their part contained in this Indenture and stating
whether or not the signer knows of any Default or Event of Default. If such signer knows of such a Default or Event of Default, the
Officers’ Certificate shall describe the Default or Event of Default and the efforts to remedy the same. For the purposes of this
Section 4.4, compliance shall be determined without regard to any grace period or requirement of notice provided pursuant to the
terms of this Indenture.

Section 4.5 Further Instruments and Acts. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company will execute and deliver such further

instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this
Indenture.

Section 4.6 Maintenance of Corporate Existence. Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Company will do or cause to be done all

things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence and the corporate existence of each Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve the corporate existence of any Restricted
Subsidiary if (a) the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the
conduct of the business of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse
in any material respect to the Holders of the Securities or (b) if a Subsidiary is to be dissolved, such Subsidiary has no assets.

Section 4.7 Changes in Covenants When Securities Rated Investment Grade. In the event of the occurrence of a Fall Away

Event (and notwithstanding the failure of the Company subsequently to

maintain an Investment Grade Rating), the provisions of Sections 4.8, 4.9, 4.12, 4.13 and 4.14 hereof and clause (iv) of

represent a portion of the exercise price of such options or warrants;

(x) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any subordinated Indebtedness pursuant to

provisions similar to those described under Section 3.8; provided that, prior thereto, all notes tendered by Holders in
connection with a Change of Control Offer have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value;

(xi) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration and payment of dividends

to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries issued in accordance with
Section 4.9; and

_however, that if the Total Leverage Ratio as of the date of any Restricted Payment to be made pursuant to this clause (xii) is_
greater than or equal to 1.75 to 1.0, such Restricted Payment shall be permitted to be made pursuant to this clause (xii) only if
the amount of such Restricted Payment, when taken together with the amount of all other Restricted Payments previously
made pursuant to this clause (xii), does not exceed $500.0 million in the aggregate.

(c) The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the Fair Market Value (determined, for purposes of this

covenant, by the Company or, in the case of any asset(s) valued in excess of $100.0 million, by the Board of Directors of the
Company, in each case evidenced by an

-----

Officers’ Certificate delivered to the Trustee) on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be
transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The
Board of Directors’ determination shall be based upon an opinion or appraisal issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment
banking firm of national standing if the Fair Market Value of such non-cash assets exceeds $500.0 million.

Section 4.9 Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue,

assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise (collectively, “incur”), with respect
to any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Company shall not issue any Disqualified Stock and shall not permit any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock; provided, however, that the Company or any

may issue preferred stock if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred
or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis
(including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the

(ii) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;

(iii) the incurrence by the Company and the Note Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Securities issued on the

Consolidated Total Assets at any time outstanding;

(v) mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any

part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, in an aggregate principal amount, including all Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (v), not to

exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace, Indebtedness (other than intercompany
Indebtedness) that was permitted by this Indenture to be incurred under Section 4.9(a) hereof or clause (ii), (iii), (xii) or
(xiv) of this Section 4.9(b) or this clause (vi) or, solely to the extent of the excess (if any) of the amount of Indebtedness
incurred and outstanding under clause (i) of this Section 4.9(b) prior to the applicable refinancing over the maximum
aggregate amount permitted to be incurred and outstanding under clause (i) of this Section 4.9(b) at the time of such
refinancing, clause (i) of this Section 4.9(b);

(vii) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or

among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:

(A) if a Note Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated to

the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the Securities; and

(B) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a

Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company shall be deemed, in
each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, that is not permitted by this clause (vii);

(viii) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are incurred in the

ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes;

(ix) the Guarantee by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of Indebtedness of the Company or

Guarantee shall be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;

(x) the accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any

Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock
in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case, that the amount
thereof is included in Fixed Charges of the Company as accrued;

(xi) Obligations in respect of performance and surety bonds and completion guarantees provided by the Company or any

Restricted Subsidiary of the Company in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $100.0 million;

(A) would be at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would be greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such
acquisition;

(xiii) the incurrence by any Foreign Subsidiary of Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount at any time

outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness

Assets;

(xiv) Indebtedness of the Company or any Note Guarantor incurred in connection with or in contemplation of, or to

provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the acquisition by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of property used or useful in a Permitted Business (whether through the direct
purchase of assets or the purchase of Capital Stock of, or merger or consolidation with, any Person owning such assets);
_provided, however, on the date of such incurrence and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, the Fixed Charge_
Coverage Ratio of the Company (A) would be at least 2.0 to 1.0 or (B) would be greater than such Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio immediately prior to such incurrence;

with respect to letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business, including letters of credit in respect of workers’
compensation claims, death, disability or other employee benefits or property, casualty or liability insurance or self-insurance,
or other Indebtedness with respect to reimbursement-type obligations regarding workers’ compensation claims; provided,
_however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such obligations are_
reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing or incurrence;

(xvi) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar

instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business, provided that such Indebtedness is
extinguished within five Business Days of notice of its incurrence;

(xvii) Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries supported by a letter of credit issued pursuant

to the Credit Facilities, in a principal amount not in excess of the stated amount of such letter of credit;

(xviii) Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries consisting of (i) the financing of insurance

premiums or (ii) take-or-pay obligations contained in supply arrangements, in each case, incurred in the ordinary course of
business; and

(xix) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate

that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or the Note Guarantors unless
such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Securities on substantially identical terms;
_provided, however, that no Indebtedness of the Company or the Note Guarantors shall be deemed to be contractually subordinated_
in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any Note Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or having
a junior lien priority.

-48

(d) For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.9, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets

the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (i) through (xix) of Section 4.9(b) hereof, or
is entitled to be incurred pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 4.9, the Company shall be permitted to classify such item of
Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify from time to time all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any
manner that complies with this Section 4.9. Indebtedness permitted by this Section 4.9 need not be permitted solely by reference to
one clause permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such clause and in part by one or more other clauses
of this Section 4.9 permitting such Indebtedness. Indebtedness under Credit Facilities outstanding on the date on which Securities
are first issued and authenticated under this Indenture will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the
exception provided by clause (i) of Section 4.9(b) hereof.

Section 4.10 [Reserved].

Section 4.11 Liens.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,

assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind on any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, except Permitted Liens, unless
contemporaneously therewith:

provision is made to secure the Securities or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, equally and ratably with or prior to
such obligation with a Lien on the same assets of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be; and

(ii) in the case of any Lien securing an obligation that is subordinated in right of payment to the Securities or a Note

Guarantee, effective provision is made to secure the Securities or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, with a Lien on the
same assets of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that is prior to the Lien securing such
subordinated obligation.

Section 4.12 Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to

exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to:

restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in those
agreements on the date of this Indenture;

(iii) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Credit Facilities incurred under clause (i) of Section 4.9(b) hereof;

Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred, or
such Capital Stock was issued, in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction
is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the
Person, so acquired, provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred under
Section 4.9 hereof;

(vi) customary non-assignment provisions in leases, contracts and licenses entered into in the ordinary course of

business and consistent with past practices;

(vii) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions on that

(xi) customary provisions with respect to the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements,

amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate
(each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $10.0 million, unless:

(i) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company or the relevant

Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate

Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $50.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the

time outstanding;

(ix) transactions with a Permitted Joint Venture in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary holds or acquires an

ownership interest (whether by way of Capital Stock or otherwise) so long as the terms of any such transactions are no less
favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary participating in such joint venture than they are to
other joint venture partners; and

(x) transactions in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a letter

from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing stating that such transaction meets the
requirements of Section 4.13(a)(i).

Section 4.14 Asset Sales.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(i) the Company (or its Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at

least equal to the Fair Market Value (determined, for purposes of this clause (i), by the Company or, in the case of any asset(s)
valued in excess of $750.0 million, by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case evidenced by an Officers’
Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(ii) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the

Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the
following will be deemed to be cash:

(A) any liabilities, as shown on the Company’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Company or any

Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the
Securities and the Note Guarantees) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to an agreement that
releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such

transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days after the
consummation of the applicable Asset Sale, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and

(C) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with

all other Designated Noncash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does not exceed at the time of the
receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater
of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets.

(b) Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company or the applicable Restricted

Subsidiary may apply those Net Proceeds:

(i) to repay Indebtedness and other Obligations under (A) a Credit Facility and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving

credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments

-52

-----

with respect thereto, (B) other secured Indebtedness or (C) other Indebtedness of a Subsidiary that does not Guarantee the
Securities, so long as the relevant assets were assets of such Subsidiary (provided, in the case of (B), that such Indebtedness is
not subordinated in right of payment to the Securities);

(ii) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted Business;

(iii) to make payments with respect to the acquisition or license of intellectual property rights that are used in a

Permitted Business;

(iv) to make a capital expenditure in or that is useful in a Permitted Business;

(v) to retire Securities pursuant to privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases or otherwise; or

(vi) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets (for the avoidance of doubt, including acquisitions of

in-process research and development) under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business.

Notwithstanding Sections 4.14(a) and 4.14(b), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply an

amount equal to any Net Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Proceeds from all
Asset Sales which are not applied in accordance with this covenant exceed the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated
Total Assets at the time of receipt of such Net Proceeds. Pending application of an amount equal to Net Proceeds pursuant to this
Section 4.14, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the
Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture.

(c) Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.14(b) hereof shall constitute

“Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of
Consolidated Total Assets, the Company shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of Securities and all holders of
Parity Indebtedness to purchase the maximum principal amount of Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness that may be
purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer shall be equal to 100% of principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and shall be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after
consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds
for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Securities and other Parity
Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select the Securities
and such other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

(d) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws

and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Securities
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale
provisions of this Indenture, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed
to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Section 4.15 Additional Note Guarantees. If any one of the Company’s Subsidiaries that is not a Note Guarantor Guarantees

any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, that Subsidiary shall (i) execute and deliver to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and a notation of Note Guarantee substantially in the form of
Exhibit B hereto or, in the case that such Subsidiary of the Company is a Canadian Note Guarantor, a Canadian Note Guarantee,
pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall unconditionally Guarantee, on a senior unsecured (unless the Securities are secured
pursuant to Section 4.11) basis, all of the Company’s obligations under the Securities and this Indenture on the terms set forth in
this Indenture and, if applicable, the Canadian Note Guarantee, and (ii) deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that such
supplemental indenture and notation of Note Guarantee or, if applicable, Canadian Note Guarantee, has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by such Subsidiary and constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of such Subsidiary.
Thereafter, such Subsidiary shall be a Note Guarantor for all purposes hereof until such Note Guarantee is released in accordance
herewith.

Section 4.16 Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Company’s Board of Directors may designate any

Restricted Subsidiary (other than Valeant) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. Any
designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be a designation of each of such entity’s Subsidiaries
as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market
Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount
available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.8 hereof or under one or more of the clauses of the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that
time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company’s Board of
Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default
and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company would be greater than immediately prior to such redesignation.

Section 4.17 Business Activities. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in

any business other than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as would not be material to the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 4.18 Payments for Consent. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly

or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of Securities for or as an inducement to
any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture relating to such Securities or such consent
unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the Securities that consent, waive or agree to amend in
the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

Section 4.19 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall

not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or
usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on the Securities as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may
affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture, and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly
waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenant that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the
execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no
such law had been enacted.

Section 4.20 [Reserved].

Section 4.21 Notice of Default. In the event that any Default or Event of Default under Section 6.1 hereof shall occur, the

Company shall give prompt written notice of such Default or Event of Default to the Trustee.

Section 4.22 Payment of Additional Amounts.

(a) All payments made by or on behalf of the Company under or with respect to the Securities, or by or on behalf of any Note

Guarantor under or with respect to any Note Guarantee (each such Person, a “Payor”) will be made free and clear of any
withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever
nature (collectively, “Tax”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which such Payor is organized, resident or
doing business for tax purposes or from or through which such Payor makes any payment on its Securities or Note Guarantee or
any department or political subdivision of any of the foregoing (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless an applicable
withholding agent is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If an applicable withholding agent is required by law to withhold
or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with
respect to any Securities or Note Guarantee, the Payor, subject to the exceptions listed below, will pay additional amounts
(“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Holder or beneficial owner of the
Securities after such withholding or deduction (including withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts payable
hereunder) will not be less than the amount the Holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been
withheld or deducted.

(b) A Payor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or beneficial owner of Securities:

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the existence of

any present or former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member
or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any connection resulting solely from
the acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of Securities, the receipt of payments thereunder or under any Note
Guarantee and/or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Securities or any Note Guarantee);

(ii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the failure of

the Holder or beneficial owner of Securities, following the Company’s or the Payor’s written request addressed to the Holder,
to the extent such Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of,
Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial
owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(iii) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales or any similar Taxes;

(iv) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the

presentation by the Holder or beneficial owner of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more
than 30 days after the date on which

-55

-----

payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(v) with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be

made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income which was adopted by the
ECOFIN Council on June 3, 2003 or any law or agreement whether or not solely between Member States of the European
Union implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to or supplement, such directive (the “EU Savings
**Tax Directive”) or is required to be made pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss**
Confederation dated October 26, 2004 providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the EU Savings Tax Directive
or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such
agreement;

(vi) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the Holder or

beneficial owner not dealing at arm’s length, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada), with such Payor;

(vii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for such Holder or

beneficial owner being, or not dealing at arm’s length (within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) with, a “specified
shareholder” of the Company as defined in subsection 18(5) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) for purposes of the thin
capitalization rules in the Income Tax Act (Canada);

(viii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts are United States federal withholding tax imposed

pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended as of the date of hereof (or any
amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current
or future regulations, official interpretations or administrative authority promulgated thereunder and any agreements entered
into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code as in effect on the date hereof (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), and, for the avoidance of doubt, any
intergovernmental agreement (and related legislation, rules or practices) implementing the foregoing (taken together,
“FATCA”), except to the extent that such Taxes result from a failure of any Paying Agent to comply with FATCA; and

(ix) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii).

(c) The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and

(ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor, as the
applicable withholding agent, will make reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor, as the applicable
withholding agent, will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or
withheld are due pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy or tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts
are not reasonably available to the Payor, such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment by the
Payor.

(d) Where Tax is payable pursuant to Regulation 803 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) by a Holder or beneficial owner of the

Securities in respect of any amount payable under the Securities to the Holder (other than by reason of a transfer of the Securities
to a person resident in Canada with whom the

-56

-----

transferor does not deal at arm’s length for the purposes of such Act), but no Additional Amount is paid in respect of such Tax, the
Payor will pay as or on account of interest to the Holder an amount equal to such Tax within 45 days after receiving from the
Holder a notice containing reasonable particulars of the Tax so payable, provided such Holder or beneficial owner would have
been entitled to receive Additional Amounts on account of such Tax (and only to the extent of such Additional Amounts that such
Holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to receive) but for the fact that it is payable otherwise than by deduction or
withholding from payments made under or with respect to the Securities.

(e) Prior to the date on which the payment of any Additional Amounts are due, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee such

Additional Amounts payable together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable on the
applicable payment date, and setting forth the Additional Amounts so payable and will also set forth such other information
necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the applicable payment date. Any such Officers’
Certificate will be delivered to the Trustee at least 2 Business Days in advance of when the payments in question are required to be
made (unless a shorter period of time is acceptable to the Trustee in its reasonable discretion). The Payor will promptly publish a
notice in accordance with Section 11.2 hereof stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation
to pay such amounts.

(f) The Payors, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Holders of Securities, upon written request of such Holder of

Securities and certified proof of payment for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and
payable by such Holder in connection with payments made under or with respect to the Securities or under or with respect to any
Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with respect to any reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this
clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such Holder after such reimbursement will not be less than the net amount such
Holder would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed,
_provided, however, that the indemnification obligation provided for in this Section 4.22(f) shall not extend to Taxes imposed for_
which the Holder of the Securities would not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional Amounts hereunder by virtue of
clauses (i) through (ix) of Section 4.22(b) hereof, or to the extent such Holder received Additional Amounts with respect to such
payments.

(g) In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges

and duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect
of the execution, issuance, registration or delivery of the Securities or any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument
referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a result of,
or in connection with, (i) any payments made pursuant to the Securities, any Note Guarantee or any other such document or
instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the enforcement of the Securities or any Note Guarantee or any other such document
or instrument referred to thereunder.

(h) The obligations described under this Section 4.22 will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture

and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to any Payor and to any jurisdiction in which such successor is organized,
doing business or is otherwise resident for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by such
successor or its respective agents.

(i) Whenever this Indenture refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount

payable under or with respect to any Security or under any Note Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional
Amounts or other payments that would be payable pursuant to this Section 4.22, if applicable.

by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro
_forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-_

ARTICLE 6

DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

Section 6.1 Events of Default. Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

same becomes due and payable (whether at maturity, upon a Redemption Date, Change of Control Purchase Date, Purchase Date
or otherwise);

continues for a period of 30 days;

(c) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries

-59

-----

(ii) to comply with the provisions described in Section 5.1 of this Indenture;

(d) the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries fails to comply with any of the other covenants contained in the

Securities or this Indenture and the Default continues for 60 days after notice to the Company from the Trustee or the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding;

(e) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or

evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is
Guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is
created after the date of this Indenture, if that default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay principal when due on such Indebtedness within any applicable grace period provided in

such Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $75.0
million or more;

(f) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final non-appealable judgments aggregating in excess

of $75.0 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after becoming final;

(g) any Note Guarantee by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect in all material respects (except as

contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Note Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies or disaffirms such Note
Guarantor’s obligations under this Indenture or any Note Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the
notice as specified in this Indenture;

(h) the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken

together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:

(i) commences a voluntary case or proceeding;

(ii) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case or proceeding;

(iii) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property; or

(iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;

(i) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

(i) is for relief against the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted

Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case or proceeding;

-60

-----

(ii) appoints a Custodian of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of

Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the
property of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; or

(iii) orders the liquidation of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of

Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary;

and in each case the order or decree described in this clause (i) remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days.

Any notice given pursuant to Section 6.1(d) hereof must be in writing and must specify the Default, demand that it be

remedied and state that the notice is a “Notice of Default.” When any Default under this Section 6.1 is cured, it ceases.

Section 6.2 Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (h) or (i) of Section 6.1

hereof with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, declare
all unpaid principal to the date of acceleration on the Securities then outstanding (if not then due and payable) to be due and
payable upon any such declaration, and the same shall become and be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default
specified in clause (h) or (i) of Section 6.1 hereof with respect to the Company occurs, all unpaid principal (including, without
limitation, any premium, if any), and accrued interest, if any, on the Securities then outstanding shall ipso facto become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and
its consequences if (a) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of the Securities which has
become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived; (b) to the extent the payment of such interest is
lawful, interest at a rate of 1% per annum over the amount of interest otherwise payable on such Securities on overdue installments
of interest and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid; (c) the
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; and (d) all payments due to the
Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 7.7 hereof have been made. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent
default or impair any right consequent thereto.

Section 6.3 Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to,

pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of the principal of or interest on the
Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of such Securities or this Indenture.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in

the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an
Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy
is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.4 Waiver of Defaults and Events of Default. Subject to Sections 6.7 and 9.2 hereof, the Holders of a majority in

aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of
Default and its consequences, except a

-61

-----

Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Securities when due or any
Default or Event of Default in respect of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities which, under Section 9.2 hereof, cannot
be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. When a Default or Event of Default is
waived, it is cured and ceases.

Section 6.5 Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding

may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy or power available to the Trustee
or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or
this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Holder of Securities or the Trustee, or
that may involve the Trustee in personal liability unless the Trustee is offered indemnity satisfactory to it; provided, however, that
the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

Section 6.6 Limitations on Suits. A Holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities (except

actions for payment of overdue principal, premium, if any, or interest) unless:

(a) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;

(b) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities make a written request

to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(c) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability

or expense;

(d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity;

and

(e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the

Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities.

A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or

priority over such other Securityholder.

Section 6.7 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any

Holder of a Security to receive payment of the principal of, or interest on the Security, on or after the respective due dates
expressed in the Security and this Indenture and to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective
dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.

Section 6.8 Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default in the payment of principal or interest specified in clause (a) or

(b) of Section 6.1 hereof occurs and is continuing with respect to any Securities, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company or another obligor on the Securities for the whole amount of principal
and accrued interest remaining unpaid, together with, to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue
principal and overdue installments of interest, in each case at a rate equal to the interest rate then in effect on such Security plus
1% per annum and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

Section 6.9 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as

may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings
relative to the Company (or any other obligor on the Securities), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to
collect and receive any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any
Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the
event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due
to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7 hereof, and to the extent that such payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien
on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other property which the Holders may be
entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to, or, on behalf of any Holder, to
authorize, accept or adopt any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights
of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

Section 6.10 Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following

order:

_First, to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.7 hereof;_

_Second, to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest ratably, without preference or_

priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest respectively; and

_Third, the balance, if any, to the Company._

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.

Section 6.11 Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit

against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party
litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good
faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit made by the Trustee, a suit by a
Holder pursuant to Section 6.7 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then
outstanding.

Section 7.3 Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee

Section 7.6 [RESERVED]

Section 7.7 Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation (as

jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee at the expense of the Company.

If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof, any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the

removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company.

Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee, upon payment of its charges hereunder, shall transfer all property held by it as Trustee
to the successor Trustee and be released from its obligations (exclusive of any liabilities that the retiring Trustee may have incurred
while acting as Trustee) hereunder, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor
Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its
succession to each Holder.

A retiring Trustee shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any successor Trustee after its succession.

Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Company’s obligations under Section 7.7 hereof

such defeasance will be deemed to have occurred.

Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Defeasance, the Trustee shall send written notice of such Covenant Defeasance to the

Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by Section 8.3(b) hereof with respect to a Covenant

Defeasance need not be delivered if all Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (1) have become due and

on the Securities.

Section 8.5 Repayment to the Company. The Trustee and each Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company upon request

any excess money (i) deposited with them pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 hereof and (ii) held by them at any time.

principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years after a right to such money has matured; provided, however, that the
Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such payment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be
mailed to each Holder entitled to

-71

-----

such money notice that such money remains unclaimed and that after a date specified therein, which shall be at least 30 days from
the date of such mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. After payment to
the Company, Holders entitled to money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable
abandoned property law designates another person.

Section 8.6 Reinstatement. If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 8.5

hereof by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Company’s obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall
be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 hereof until such time as the Trustee
or such Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.5 hereof;
_provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of the principal of or interest on any Securities because of the_
reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive any such
payment from the money or Government Securities held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent.

adversely affect the legal rights under this Indenture of any such Holder;

(f) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the

TIA;

(g) to conform the text of this Indenture or the Securities to any provision of the section of the Offering Circular dated

recitation of a provision of this Indenture or the Securities;

(h) to provide for the issuance of Additional Securities in accordance with the limitations set forth in this Indenture as of

the date hereof;

-72

-----

(i) to add additional Note Guarantees with respect to the Securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or

discharge of any Note Guarantee with respect to such Securities when such release, termination or discharge is permitted
under this Indenture; or

(j) to appoint a successor Trustee.

Section 9.2 With Consent of Holders. The Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture with respect to

the Securities with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then
outstanding. The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may waive
compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities without notice to any
Holder. However, notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 9.4 hereof, without the written consent of each Holder of
Securities affected hereby, an amendment, supplement or waiver, including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof, may not:

(a) reduce the principal amount of such Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(b) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any such Security or alter the provisions with respect to the

redemption of such Securities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, provisions relating to Sections 3.8, 3.14 and 4.14);

(c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any such Security;

(d) make any such Security payable in money other than U.S. dollars;

(e) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of

(h) modify the Note Guarantees with respect to such Securities in any manner adverse to the Holders of such Securities;

or

(i) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions with respect to such Securities.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed

amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under Section 9.1 or this Section 9.2 becomes effective, the Company shall mail

to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to
mail such notice, or any defect

-73

-----

therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.

Section 9.3 [Reserved].

Section 9.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it

by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that
evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However,
any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the
notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described

in any of clauses (a) through (i) of Section 9.2 hereof. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of
a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt
as the consenting Holder’s Security.

Section 9.5 Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security,

the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the
Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the
Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.

Section 9.6 Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc. The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplemental indenture authorized

pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplemental indenture does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may, in its sole discretion, but need not sign it. In signing or refusing to sign such
amendment or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall be provided with and, subject to Section 7.1 hereof, shall be fully
protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers’ Certificate stating that such amendment or supplemental
indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and all conditions precedent in this Indenture to such execution have been
complied with. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until its Board of Directors approves it in
writing.

Section 9.7 Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this

Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all
purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.

ARTICLE 10

NOTE GUARANTEES

Section 10.1 Note Guarantees.

(a) Each of the Note Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally Guarantees to each Holder of a Security

authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and
enforceability of this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder that: (i) the due and
punctual payment of principal, premium and interest on the Securities shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity,
by

-74

-----

acceleration, redemption or otherwise, (ii) the due and punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the
Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture or any
Security shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, and (iii) in case of any
extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that same shall be promptly paid in full
when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration
pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so
guaranteed for whatever reason, the Note Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each
Note Guarantor shall agree that this is a Guarantee of payment and not a Guarantee of collection.

(b) Each of the Note Guarantors hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to its Guarantee shall be joint and several,

unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this
Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor
with respect to this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the Securities, any action to
enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense of a Note Guarantor. Each Note Guarantor further, to the extent permitted by law, shall waive and
relinquish all claims, rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors and shall agree not to assert or take advantage
of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (i) any right to require any of the Trustee, the Holders or the
Company (each a “Benefited Party”), as a condition of payment or performance by such Note Guarantor, to (A) proceed against
the Company, any other guarantor (including any other Note Guarantor) of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or any other
person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Company, any such other guarantor or any other person,
(C) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Benefited Party in favor of
the Company or any other person, or (D) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Benefited Party whatsoever; (ii) any defense
arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of the Company including any defense based
on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or any agreement or
instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of the Company from any cause other than payment in full
of the obligations under the Note Guarantees; (iii) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the
obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (iv) any
defense based upon any Benefited Party’s errors or omissions in the administration of the obligations under the Note Guarantees,
except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (v) (A) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might
be in conflict with the terms of the Note Guarantees and any legal or equitable discharge of such Note Guarantor’s obligations
hereunder and under its Note Guarantee, (B) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Note Guarantor’s liability
hereunder and under its Note Guarantee or the enforcement hereof and thereof, (C) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and
counterclaims and (D) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Benefited Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any
security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (vi) notices, demands, presentations, protests, notices of protest, notices of
dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of the Note Guarantees, notices of default under the Securities
or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the obligations under the Note
Guarantees or any agreement related thereto, and notices of any extension of credit to the Company and any right to consent to any
thereof; (vii) to the extent permitted under applicable law, the benefits of any “One Action” rule; and (viii) any defenses or benefits
that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict
with the terms of the Note Guarantees. Except as set forth in Section 10.5, each Note Guarantor shall covenant that its Note
Guarantee shall not be

-75

-----

discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in its Note Guarantee and this Indenture.

(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Note Guarantors or any

custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Note Guarantors, any amount
paid to either the Trustee or such Holder, any Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and
effect.

(d) Each Note Guarantor shall agree that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect

of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Note Guarantor shall further
agree that, as between the Note Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of
the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 hereof for the purposes of any Guarantee,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed
hereby and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 6.2 hereof, such
obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Note Guarantors for the purpose of
any such Guarantee. The Note Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Note Guarantor so long as
the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the applicable Guarantee.

Section 10.2 Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantees. To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.1 hereof, each

Note Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto or, in the case of
a Note Guarantor organized under the laws of Canada or any province or territory thereof, a Canadian Note Guarantee, shall be
endorsed by an officer of such Note Guarantor on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture
shall be executed on behalf of such Note Guarantor by any of its Officers. Each of the Note Guarantors, jointly and severally,
hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.1 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to
endorse on each Security a notation of such Note Guarantee. If an officer or Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the
Note Guarantee of a Note Guarantor no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security on which the
Note Guarantee of such Note Guarantor is endorsed, the Note Guarantee of such Note Guarantor shall be valid nevertheless. The
delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Note
Guarantees set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Note Guarantors.

Section 10.3 Limitation on Note Guarantor Liability. Each Note Guarantor shall confirm, and by its acceptance of Securities,

each Holder hereby confirms, that it is the intention of all such parties that any Guarantee of such Note Guarantor not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar applicable law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing
intention, the Trustee and the Holders irrevocably agree, and the Note Guarantors shall irrevocably agree, that the obligations of
such Note Guarantor under this Article 10 shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum
amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Note Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving
effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Note Guarantor in
respect of the obligations of such other Note Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Note Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Section 10.4 Merger and Consolidation of Note Guarantors.

(a) In case of any sale or other disposition, consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption

by the successor person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee,
of the Note Guarantee endorsed upon the Securities and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of
this Indenture to be performed by the Note Guarantor, such successor person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Note
Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Note Guarantor. Such successor person thereupon may cause to
be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Securities available hereunder which theretofore shall
not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the
same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the
terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

(b) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clause (a) of this Section 10.4, nothing contained in this

Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation, amalgamation or merger of a Note Guarantor with or into the
Company or another Note Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Note Guarantor as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Note Guarantor.

Section 10.5 Release.

(a) In the event (i) of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Note Guarantor, by way of

merger, amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all the Equity Interests of any Note Guarantor,
in each case to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transactions) a Subsidiary of the Company, so long
as the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture,
including without limitation Section 4.14 hereof, (ii) of a designation by the Company of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Note
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the definition thereof, (iii) upon the release or discharge of any Note
Guarantee in respect of any Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the Issue Date of the Note Guarantee by such Note
Guarantor or (iv) the Company discharges this Indenture under Section 8.1 or exercises its legal or covenant defeasance options
under Section 8.2 or 8.3, respectively, such Note Guarantor or, in the case of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of such Note Guarantor, the Person acquiring such property, shall be released and relieved of any obligations under its
Guarantee without any further action being required by the Trustee or any Holder. If the Company discharges this Indenture under
Section 8.1 or exercises its legal or covenant defeasance options under Section 8.2 or 8.3, respectively, the Company shall be
released and relieved of any obligations under its Note Guarantee without any further action being required by the Trustee or any
Holder.

(b) Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such

sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including without
limitation Section 4.8 hereof, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any
Note Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee.

(c) Any Note Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of

restriction or amount, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of any amount denominated in a foreign currency will be the
Dollar Equivalent calculated on the date the Indebtedness was incurred or other transaction was entered into; provided that if any
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars is incurred to refinance Indebtedness
denominated in the same currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness shall be deemed not to exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no restriction or
amount will be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies.

Section 11.19 Usury Savings Clause. If any provision of this Indenture or any Security would obligate the Company to make

any payment of or on account of interest or other amount in an amount or calculated at a rate which would result in a receipt by
any Holder of interest at a criminal rate (as such term is construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then notwithstanding such
provisions, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of
interest, as the case may be, as would not so result in a receipt by such Holder of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be
effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1) firstly, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such
Holder, and (2) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to such Holder
which would constitute “interest” for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada).

Section 11.20 Interest Act (Canada). For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of

interest or fees to which the rates of interest or fees provided for in this Indenture and any Security (and stated herein or therein, as
applicable, to be computed on the basis of a 360 day year or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent are
the rates so provided for multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 360 or the actual
number of days in such other period of time, respectively.

The Company shall be entitled to issue Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of the Indenture.

5. OPTIONAL REDEMPTION; PURCHASE OF NOTES AT OPTION OF HOLDER.

(a) Optional Redemption. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at the prices, and upon the terms and

conditions, set forth in Section 3.7 of the Indenture.

(b) Repurchase at Option of Holder. If there is a Change of Control, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a

“Change of Control Offer”) to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of
each Holder’s Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change
of Control, the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder setting forth the procedures governing the Change of Control Offer as
required by the Indenture.

If after the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary consummates any Asset Sale, the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds

exceeds the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, the Company shall commence an offer to all Holders
of Notes and all holders of other Parity Indebtedness to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and such
other Parity Indebtedness that may be purchased (or repaid, prepaid or redeemed) equal to the aggregate Excess Proceeds (an
“Asset Sale Offer”) pursuant to Section 4.14 of the Indenture to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and other
Parity Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such
offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other
Parity Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company (or such Restricted
Subsidiary) may use such deficiency for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount
of Notes and other Parity Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall
select the Notes and other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Holders of Notes that are the subject of an offer
to purchase will receive an Asset Sale Offer from the Company prior to any related purchase date and may elect to have such
Notes purchased by completing the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of the Notes.

A-6


-----

(d) Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the

redemption date to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations larger than
$2,000 may be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be
redeemed. On and after the redemption date interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

6. DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE, CANCELLATION

The Notes are in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess

thereof. A Holder may register the transfer of or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a
Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes or other
governmental charges that may be imposed in relation thereto by law or permitted by the Indenture.

All Notes surrendered for payment, registration of transfer or exchange or conversion will, if surrendered to the Company or

any of its other Agents with respect to the Notes, be delivered to the Trustee. The Trustee will promptly cancel all Notes delivered
to it. No Notes will be authenticated in exchange for any Notes cancelled, except as provided in the Indenture.

7. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS

The Holder of a Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

8. UNCLAIMED MONEY

If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay the

money back to the Company at its written request, subject to applicable unclaimed property law. After that, Holders entitled to
money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates
another person.

9. AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture (with respect to the Notes) or the Notes may be amended or supplemented with

the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and an existing
default or Event of Default and its consequence or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived in a
particular instance with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.
Without the consent of or notice to any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture (with
respect to the Notes) or the Notes to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or make any other change
that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder.

10. SUCCESSOR ENTITY

with the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the predecessor corporation (except in certain circumstances specified in the
Indenture) shall be released from those obligations.

Under the Indenture, an Event of Default includes: (i) default in payment of any principal (including, without limitation, any

aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare all unpaid principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if
any, to the date of acceleration on the Notes then outstanding to be due and payable immediately, all as and to the extent provided
in the Indenture. If an Event of Default occurs as a result of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the
Company, unpaid principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the Notes then outstanding shall become due and
payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, all as and to the extent provided
in the Indenture. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require
indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee
may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines
that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company is required to file periodic reports with the Trustee as to the absence of
default.

12. TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH THE COMPANY

The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity,

may make loans to, accept deposits from and perform services for the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and may otherwise
deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company as if it were not the Trustee.

any obligations of the Company or any Note Guarantor under the Notes or the Indenture nor for any claim based on, in respect of

liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of this Note.

advantage of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (i) any right to require any Beneficiary, as a

amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (iv) any defense based upon any Beneficiary’s
errors or omissions in the administration of the Guaranteed Obligations, except behavior which amounts to bad faith;
(v) (A) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms of this

custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or any Note Guarantor, any
amount paid to either the Trustee or such Holder, this Canadian Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
reinstated in full force and effect.

(d) Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations
guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor further agrees that, as between Guarantor,
on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations may be
accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 of the Indenture for the purposes of this Canadian Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any
stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) in the event
of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 6.2 of the Indenture, such obligations (whether or
not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by Guarantor for the purpose of this Canadian Note Guarantee.
Guarantor shall not exercise any right to seek contribution from any non-paying Note Guarantor if the exercise of such right
impairs the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantees.

**2.2. Merger and Consolidation of Guarantors**

(a) In case of any sale or other disposition, consolidation, merger, amalgamation or conveyance and upon the assumption by the
successor person on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Trustee of the obligations of Guarantor under this Canadian Note
Guarantee, and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be performed by
Guarantor, such successor person shall succeed to and be substituted for Guarantor under this Canadian Note Guarantee with
the same effect as if it had been named herein as Guarantor.

as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Note Guarantor.

**Section 3.**

**Miscellaneous**

**3.1. Limitations Act, 2002 (Ontario)**

Any and all limitation periods provided for in the Limitations Act, 2002 (Ontario), as amended from time to time, or any other
applicable law limiting the time for which an action may be commenced shall be excluded from application to the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder to fullest extent permitted by such Act or applicable law.

**3.2. Usury Savings Clause**

If any provision of this Canadian Note Guarantee, the Indenture or any Security would obligate any Canadian Note Guarantor to
make any payment of or on account of interest or other amount in an amount or calculated at a rate which would result in a receipt
by any Holder of interest at a criminal rate (as such term is construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then notwithstanding
such provisions, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate
of interest, as the case may be, as would not so result in a receipt by such Holder of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to
be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1) firstly, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such
Holder, and (2) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to such Holder
which would constitute “interest” for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada).

**3.3. Interest Act (Canada)**

For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or
fees provided for in this Canadian Note Guarantee, the Indenture or the Securities (and stated herein or therein, as applicable, to be
computed on the basis of a 360 day year or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent are the rates so
provided for multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 360 or the actual number of
days in such other period of time, respectively.

**3.4. Counterparts; Execution**

This Canadian Note Guarantee may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts,
each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall
constitute but one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Canadian Note Guarantee facsimile or other
similar method of electronic transmission (including by way of email attachment) shall be equally as effective as delivery of an
original executed counterpart of this Canadian Note Guarantee.

**3.5. Severability**

If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Canadian Note Guarantee or its application to any party or circumstance is restricted,
prohibited or unenforceable, such provision shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such restriction,
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Canadian Note Guarantee and without
affecting the validity or enforceability

of such provision in any other jurisdiction or without affecting its application to other parties or circumstances.

**3.6. Notices**

All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, sent, or delivered in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture.

**3.7. Successors**

This Canadian Note Guarantee shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and shall inure to the benefit of the successors
of the Beneficiaries.

**3.8. Judgment Currency**

Guarantor shall indemnify each Holder and each Person, if any, who controls any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any loss incurred by such party as a result of any judgment or order being
given or made against Guarantor for any U.S. dollar amount due under this Canadian Note Guarantee and such judgment or order
being expressed and paid in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than U.S. dollars and as a result of any variation as
between (i) the rate of exchange at which the U.S. dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such
judgment or order and (ii) the spot rate of exchange in The City of New York at which such party on the date of payment of such
judgment or order is able to purchase U.S. dollars with the amount of the Judgment Currency actually received by such party if
such party had utilized such amount of Judgment Currency to purchase U.S. dollars upon such party’s receipt thereof. Any amount
due from Guarantor under this Section 3.8 shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by such judgment or order as
aforesaid. The term “spot rate of exchange” shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the
purchase of, or conversion into, U.S. dollars.

**3.9. Payment of Additional Amounts**

(a) All payments made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee by Guarantor will be made free and clear of any
withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of
whatever nature (collectively, “Tax”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of Canada or any other jurisdiction in which
Guarantor is organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or through which Guarantor makes any payment
on the Canadian Note Guarantee or any department or political subdivision thereof (each, a “Relevant Taxing
**Jurisdiction”), unless Guarantor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If Guarantor is required by law to withhold**
or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with
respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee, Guarantor, subject to the exceptions listed below, will pay additional amounts
(“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Holder or beneficial owner of
the Securities after such withholding or deduction (including withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts
payable hereunder) will not be less than the amount the Holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not
been withheld or deducted.

(b) Guarantor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or beneficial owner of Securities:

D-6


-----

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the existence of
any present or former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary,
member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial
owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any connection
resulting solely from the acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of Securities, the receipt of payments
thereunder or under this Canadian Note Guarantee and/or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Securities or
this Canadian Note Guarantee);

(ii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the failure of the
Holder or beneficial owner of Securities, following Guarantor’s written request addressed to the Holder, to the extent
such Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification, information
or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes
imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial
owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(iii) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales or any similar Taxes;

(iv) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the presentation
by the Holder or beneficial owner of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than
30 days after the date on which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly
provided for, whichever occurs later;

(v) with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be
made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income which was adopted by the
ECOFIN Council on June 3, 2003 or any law or agreement whether or not solely between Member States of the
European Union implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to or supplement, such directive
(the “EU Savings Tax Directive”) or is required to be made pursuant to the Agreement between the European
Community and the Swiss Confederation dated October 26, 2004 providing for measures equivalent to those laid down
in the EU Savings Tax Directive or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or complying with, or
introduced in order to conform to, such agreement;

(vi) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the Holder or
beneficial owner not dealing at arm’s length, within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada), with the Company or
Guarantor;

(vii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for such Holder or
beneficial owner being, or not dealing at arm’s length (within the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) with, a
“specified shareholder” of the Company as defined in subsection 18(5) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) for purposes of
the thin capitalization rules in the Income Tax Act (Canada);

D-7


-----

(viii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts are United States federal withholding tax imposed

pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended as of the date of hereof (or
any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with),
any current or future regulations, official interpretations or administrative authority promulgated thereunder and any
agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code as in effect on the date hereof (or any amended or
successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any intergovernmental agreement (and related legislation, rules or practices) implementing the
foregoing (taken together, “FATCA”), except to the extent that such Taxes result from a failure of any Paying Agent to
comply with FATCA; and

(ix) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii).

(c) Guarantor will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. Guarantor will make reasonable efforts to
obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. Guarantor will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld are due pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy or tax receipts
evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts are not reasonably available to Guarantor, such other documentation that
provides reasonable evidence of such payment by Guarantor.

(d) Where Tax is payable pursuant to Regulation 803 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) by a Holder or beneficial owner of the
Securities in respect of any amount payable under the Canadian Note Guarantee to the Holder (other than by reason of a
transfer of the Securities to a person resident in Canada with whom the transferor does not deal at arm’s length for the
purposes of such Act), but no Additional Amount is paid in respect of such Tax, Guarantor will pay as or on account of
interest to the Holder an amount equal to such Tax within 45 days after receiving from the Holder a notice containing
reasonable particulars of the Tax so payable, provided such Holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to receive
Additional Amounts on account of such Tax (and only to the extent of such Additional Amounts that such Holder or
beneficial owner would have been entitled to receive) but for the fact that it is payable otherwise than by deduction or
withholding from payments made under or with respect to the Canadian Note Guarantee.

(e) Prior to the date on which the payment of any Additional Amounts are due, Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee such
Additional Amounts payable together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable on
the applicable payment date, and setting forth the Additional Amounts so payable and will also set forth such other
information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the applicable payment date. Any
such Officers’ Certificate will be delivered to the Trustee at least 2 Business Days in advance of when the payments in
question are required to be made (unless a shorter period of time is acceptable to the Trustee in its reasonable discretion).
Guarantor will promptly publish a notice in accordance with Section 11.2 of the Indenture stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

(f) Guarantor will reimburse the Holders of Securities, upon written request of such Holder of Securities and certified proof of
payment for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such Holder in
connection with payments made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed
with

D-8


-----

respect to any reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such Holder
after such reimbursement will not be less than the net amount such Holder would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the
reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification
obligation provided for in this Section 3.9(f) shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the Holder of the Securities would
not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional Amounts hereunder by virtue of clauses (i) through (ix) of
Section 3.9(b) hereof, or to the extent such Holder received Additional Amounts with respect to such payments.

(g) In addition, Guarantor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges and
duties, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in
respect of the execution, issuance, registration or delivery of this Canadian Note Guarantee or any other document or
instrument referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any
time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any payments made pursuant to any Guarantee or any other such document or
instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the enforcement of this Canadian Note Guarantee or any other such document or
instrument referred to thereunder.

(h) Obligations described under this Section 3.9 will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to Guarantor and to any jurisdiction in which such successor is organized,
doing business or is otherwise resident for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by such
successor or its respective agents.

(i) Whenever this Canadian Note Guarantee refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any
other amount payable under or with respect to any Security or under this Canadian Note Guarantee, such reference includes
the payment of Additional Amounts or other payments that would be payable pursuant to this Section 3.9, if applicable.
