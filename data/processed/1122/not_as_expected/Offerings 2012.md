_6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 and 6.375% Concurrent Notes due 2020_

On October 4, 2012, (1) VPI Escrow Corp., a newly formed wholly owned Delaware subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International
(“Valeant”), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (the “Company”), completed its previously
announced offering (the “Senior Notes Offering”) of $1,750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “Senior
Notes”), and (2) Valeant completed its previously announced offering (the “Concurrent Offering”) of $500 million aggregate principal amount
of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “Concurrent Notes”, and together with the Senior Notes, the “Notes”)

The Notes were offered and sold to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not
been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities law and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent
registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.

As previously announced, on September 2, 2012, the Company, Valeant, Merlin Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Valeant (“Merger Sub”), and Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Medicis”), entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides for Merger Sub to merge with and into Medicis
(the “Merger”), with Medicis surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Valeant. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease and Medicis will continue as the surviving corporation.

The Senior Notes are the senior unsecured obligations of VPI Escrow Corp. and, upon consummation of the Merger, in accordance with
the terms of the Supplemental Indenture (as defined below), Valeant will assume all of VPI Escrow Corp.’s obligations under the Senior Notes
and the Senior Notes will be jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and each of the Company’s
subsidiaries (other than Valeant) that is a guarantor under the Company’s senior secured credit facilities. The Concurrent Notes are the senior
unsecured obligations of Valeant and are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and each of the
Company’s subsidiaries (other than Valeant) that is a guarantor under the Company’s senior secured credit facilities.

The net proceeds of the Senior Notes Offering are expected to be used to fund (i) the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, (ii) Medicis’s obligation to pay the conversion consideration with respect to, or repurchase, its outstanding notes, and
(iii) transaction expenses in connection with the Merger Agreement. Valeant intends to use the net proceeds of the Concurrent Offering for
general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions.

In connection with the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes, VPI Escrow Corp. additionally entered into an escrow and security
agreement (the “Escrow and Security Agreement”), dated as of October 4, 2012, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as
trustee under the Indentures (as defined below), and as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). The proceeds of the Senior Notes Offering were
deposited, pursuant to the Escrow and Security Agreement, into a segregated escrow account pending completion of the Merger.

Pursuant to the Escrow and Security Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture (as defined below), if the Merger has not been
consummated or the other conditions described therein have not been satisfied on or prior to the Deadline (as defined in the Senior Notes
Indenture) or if VPI Escrow Corp. shall notify the trustee in writing of VPI Escrow Corp.’s or the Company’s announcement that the Merger
Agreement has been terminated or that it will not pursue the consummation of the Merger, VPI Escrow Corp. will be required to redeem the
Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the issue price of Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date of the
Senior Notes.

_Senior Notes Indenture and Concurrent Indenture_

The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to the indenture, dated as of October 4, 2012 (the “Escrow Corp Indenture”), between VPI Escrow

Corp. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, as trustee (the “Trustee”), and pursuant to a supplemental indenture dated
October 4, 2012 (the “Supplemental Indenture”), among Valeant, the Company, the guarantors named therein and (the Trustee), upon
consummation of the Merger (the Escrow Corp Indenture as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the “Senior Notes Indenture”). The
Concurrent Notes were issued pursuant to the indenture, dated as of October 4, 2012, among Valeant, the Company, the guarantors named
therein, and the Trustee (the “Concurrent Indenture”, the together with the Senior Notes Indenture, the “Indentures”).


-----

Interest on the Notes will be payable semi annually in arrears on each April 15 and October 15, commencing on April 15, 2013.

Valeant may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at any time prior to October 15, 2016, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, plus a “make-whole” premium. On or after October 15, 2016,
Valeant may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the redemption prices applicable to the Notes as set forth in the Indentures, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of redemption of the Notes. In addition, prior to October 15, 2015, Valeant may redeem up to 35% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings.

In the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Indentures), unless Valeant has exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Notes
or Concurrent Notes, respectively, each holder of the Senior Notes or the Concurrent Notes, as applicable, may require Valeant to repurchase
such holder’s Notes in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the purchase date of the Notes.

The Indentures contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and any of its restricted subsidiaries (as such term is defined in the

Indentures) to, among other things:

         - incur or guarantee additional debt;

         - make certain investments and other restricted payments;

         - engage in mergers, consolidations or amalgamations;

Escrow Corp Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and the Concurrent Indenture, copies of which are attached as Exhibit 4.1, Exhibit 4.2 and

Transaction”) of the Company’s then outstanding Tranche B Term Loans, Series A Tranche B Term Loans and Series B Tranche B Term
Loans (collectively, the “Repriced Tranche B Term Loans”). The Joinder provides that the applicable margin for each new Series D Tranche B
Term Loan made pursuant to the Joinder with respect to Eurodollar rate loans will be 3.25% per annum and with respect to base rate loans will
be 2.25% per annum. The applicable margins for the Repriced Tranche B Term Loans were 3.75% per annum for Eurodollar rate loans and

outstanding at any time may not exceed $1,750,000,000, except as provided in Sections 2.1(c), 2.1(d) and 2.7 hereof.

The Trustee shall act as the initial authenticating agent. Thereafter, the Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the

principal of or interest, on the Securities, and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company (or any other obligor on the Securities) in
making any such payment. If the Company or an Affiliate of the Company acts as Paying Agent, the Company or such Affiliate shall, before
11:00 a.m., New York City time, on each due date of the principal of or interest on any Securities, segregate the money and hold it as a separate
trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee, and the Trustee may at any time
during the continuance of any Default, upon written request to a Paying Agent, require such Paying Agent to pay forthwith to the Trustee all
sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent (other than the Company) shall have no further liability for the
money.

may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders.

any Security for registration of transfer or exchange at an office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, the Company shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities of a like aggregate principal amount at the Registrar’s request. Any exchange or transfer

governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto, and provided, that this sentence shall not apply to any exchange pursuant to
Section 2.10, 2.12(a), 3.6, 3.11 or 9.5 hereof.

(b) Any Registrar appointed pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof shall provide to the Trustee such information as the Trustee may reasonably
require in connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Securities upon transfer or exchange of Securities.

(c) Each Holder of a Security agrees to indemnify the Company and the Trustee against any liability that may result from the transfer,
exchange or assignment of such Holder’s Security in violation of any provision of this Indenture and/or applicable United States federal, state,
Canadian federal, provincial or territorial securities law.

Section 2.7 Replacement Securities . If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Company, a Registrar or the Trustee, or the Company,

a Registrar and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and there is delivered to the
Company, the applicable Registrar and the Trustee such security or indemnity as will be required by them to save each of them harmless, then,
in the absence of notice to the Company, such Registrar or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the
Company shall execute, and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated Security or
in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor and principal amount, bearing a number not
contemporaneously outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be
purchased by the Company pursuant to Article 3, the Company in their discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay or purchase such
Security, as the case may be.

Upon the issuance of any new Securities under this Section 2.7, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of the Trustee or the Registrar) in connection therewith.

Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an
original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly
issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section 2.7 are (to the extent lawful) exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and
remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Section 2.8 Outstanding Securities . Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee, except for those
canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation or surrendered for transfer or exchange and those described in this Section 2.8 as not
outstanding.

If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Company receives proof satisfactory to it
that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.

thereof) payable on that date, then on and after such Redemption Date, Change of Control Purchase Date or the Final Maturity Date, as the case
may be, such Securities (or portions thereof, as the case may be) shall cease to be outstanding and interest on them shall cease to accrue.

Subject to the restrictions contained in Section 2.9 hereof, a Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an
Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.

Section 2.9 Treasury Securities . In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any

notice, direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities or by any Affiliate of the
Company or of such other obligor shall be disregarded, except that, for purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in
relying on any such notice, direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which a Trust Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall
be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith shall not be disregarded if the pledgee establishes to the
satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee’s right so to act with respect to the Securities and that the pledgee is neither the Company nor any other
obligor on the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor.

Section 2.10 Temporary Securities . Until Definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and execute, and, upon
receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the
form of Definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company with the consent of the Trustee considers appropriate for temporary
Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver definitive Securities in
exchange for temporary Securities.

Section 2.11 Cancellation . The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying
Agent shall forward to the Trustee or its agent any Securities surrendered to them for transfer, exchange, payment or conversion. The Trustee
and no one else shall cancel, in accordance with its standard procedures, all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment, conversion
or cancellation and shall deliver the canceled Securities to the Company. All Securities which are purchased or otherwise acquired by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Final Maturity Date may be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or resold. The Company
may not hold or resell such Securities or issue any new Securities to replace any Securities delivered for cancellation

Section 2.12 Legend; Additional Transfer and Exchange Requirements .

(a) If Securities are issued upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of Securities subject to restrictions on transfer and bearing the
legends set forth on the form of Securities attached hereto as Exhibit A (collectively, the “ Legend ”), or if a request is made to remove the
Legend on a Security, the Securities so issued shall bear the Legend, or the Legend shall not be removed, as the case may be, unless there is
delivered to the Company such satisfactory evidence, which shall include an opinion of counsel if requested by the Company, as may be
reasonably required by the Company, that neither the Legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure that
transfers thereof comply with the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or that such Securities are not “restricted” within the meaning
of Rule 144 under the Securities Act; provided that no such evidence need be supplied in connection with the sale of such Security pursuant to
a registration statement that is effective at the time of such sale. Upon (i) provision of satisfactory evidence if requested, or (ii) notification by
the Company

-----

at the written direction of the Company, shall authenticate and deliver a Security that does not bear the Legend. If the Legend is removed from
the face of a Security and the Security is subsequently held by an Affiliate of the Company, the Legend shall be reinstated.

(b) A Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any Person other than the Depositary or a nominee or any successor
thereof, and no such transfer to any such other Person may be registered; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any transfer of a
Security that is issued in exchange for a Global Security but is not itself a Global Security; provided further that in no event shall a beneficial
interest in a Regulation S Global Security be transferred to a U.S. Person prior to the receipt by the Registrar of any certificates required
pursuant to Regulation S, as determined by the Company. No transfer of a Security to any Person shall be effective under this Indenture or the
Securities unless and until such Security has been registered in the name of such Person. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture
or the Securities, transfers of a Global Security, in whole or in part, shall be made only in accordance with this section 2.12.

(c) Subject to the succeeding paragraph, every Security shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided in the Legend. Whenever

any Restricted Security is presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange for a Security registered in a name other than that
of the Holder, such Security must be accompanied by a certificate in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A, dated the date of such
surrender and signed by the Holder of such Security, as to compliance with such restrictions on transfer. The Registrar shall not be required to
accept for such registration of transfer or exchange any Security not so accompanied by a properly completed certificate.

(d) The restrictions imposed by the Legend upon the transferability of any Security shall cease and terminate when such Security has been

sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or transferred in compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act
(or any successor provision thereto) or, if earlier, upon the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(d)(1)(ii)
under the Securities Act (or any successor provision). Any Security as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance
with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon a surrender of such Security for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.12 (accompanied, in the event that such restrictions on transfer have terminated by reason of a transfer in
compliance with Rule 144 or any successor provision, by, if requested by the Company or the Registrar, an opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Company and addressed to the Company to the effect that the transfer of such Security has been made in compliance with
Rule 144 or such successor provision), be exchanged for a new Security, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the
restrictive Legend. The Company shall inform the Trustee of the effective date of any registration statement registering the Securities under the
Securities Act. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
aforementioned opinion of counsel or registration statement.

(e) As used in this Section 2.12, the term “transfer” encompasses any sale, pledge, transfer, hypothecation or other disposition of any
Security.

(f) The provisions of clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) below shall apply only to Global Securities:

(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the Securities, a Global Security shall not be exchanged in whole or in
part for a Security registered in the name of any Person other than the Depositary or one or more nominees thereof, provided that a Global
Security may be exchanged for Securities registered in the names of any person designated by the Depositary in the event that (A) the
Depositary (x) has notified the obligors that it is unwilling or

the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not appointed by the obligors within 90 days after receipt of such notice or
the Company becomes aware of such failure of registration or (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the
Securities. Any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (A) above shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part, and any Global
Security exchanged pursuant to clause (B) may be exchanged in whole or from time to time in part as directed by the Depositary. Any
Security issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be a Global Security; provided that any such Security so
issued that is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary or a nominee thereof shall not be a Global Security.

(ii) Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be issued in definitive, fully registered form,
without interest coupons, shall have an aggregate principal amount equal to that of such Global Security or portion thereof to be so
exchanged, shall be registered in such names and be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary shall designate and shall bear the
applicable legends provided for herein. Any Global Security to be exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the
Trustee, as Registrar. With regard to any Global Security to be exchanged in part, either such Global Security shall be so surrendered for
exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as custodian for the Depositary or its nominee with respect to such Global Security, the principal
amount thereof shall be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment
made on the records of the Trustee. Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Security
issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or an authorized representative thereof.

(iii) Subject to the provisions of clause (v) below, the registered Holder may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person,
including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to
take under this Indenture or the Securities.

(iv) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in clause (i) above, the obligors will promptly make available to the

Trustee a reasonable supply of Definitive Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons.

(v) Neither Agent members nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this
Indenture with respect to any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global
Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the
Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any
written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between
the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary
practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.

(vi) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer
imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers
between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and
other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so as and when expressly required by, the terms or this Indenture,
and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.

Holders in accordance with this Section 3.3. Concurrently with the mailing of any such notice of redemption, the Company shall issue a press
release announcing such redemption, the form and content of which shall be determined by the Company. A notice of redemption may not be

(8) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Securities and other Parity Indebtedness surrendered in connection with the Asset Sale

offer exceeds the Offer Amount, the Company shall select the Securities and other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis
based on the principal amount of Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness surrendered (with such adjustments as may be deemed
appropriate by the Company so that only Securities in denominations of $2,000, or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, will be

(b) The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or
rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any
change in the location of any such other office or agency.

Certificates).

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent fails to comply with its obligation to file or provide such

Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Securities
or (b) if a Subsidiary is to be dissolved, such Subsidiary has no assets.

(xix) the incurrence by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or

Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of Parent, the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors
unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Securities on substantially identical terms; provided,
_however, that no Indebtedness of Parent, the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right_
of payment to any other Indebtedness of Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or having a
junior lien priority.

later reclassify from time to time all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section 4.9. Indebtedness
permitted by this Section 4.9 need not be permitted solely by reference to one clause permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part
by one such clause and in part by one or more other clauses of this Section 4.9 permitting such Indebtedness. Indebtedness under Credit
Facilities outstanding on the date on which Securities are first issued and authenticated under this Indenture will be deemed to have been

effective provision is made to secure the Securities or such Note Guarantee, as the case may be, with a Lien on the same assets of Parent

Section 4.12 Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries .

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Company) to, directly or indirectly, create or

connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the
properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired, provided that, in the case of
Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred under Section 4.9 hereof;

aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $10.0 million, unless:

(i) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary
than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person;
and

(ii) Parent delivers to the Trustee, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of $50.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company set forth in an Officers’

Section 4.14 Asset Sales .

(a) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(i) Parent (or its Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the
Fair Market Value (determined, for purposes of this clause (i), by Parent or, in the case of any asset(s) valued in excess of $75.0 million,
by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case evidenced by an Officers’ Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of the assets or
Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(ii) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or
Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(A) any liabilities, as shown on Parent’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other
than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Securities and the Note Guarantees) that are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to an agreement that releases Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from
further liability;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by Parent or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that
are converted by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days after the consummation of the applicable Asset
Sale, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and

(C) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value that, when taken together with all other
Designated Noncash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does not exceed at the time of the receipt of such
Designated Noncash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured
at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated
Total Assets.

(b) Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Parent or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may apply
those Net Proceeds:

(i) to repay Indebtedness and other Obligations under (A) a Credit Facility and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit

Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, (B) other secured Indebtedness or (C) other Indebtedness of a
Subsidiary (other than the Company) that does not Guarantee the Securities, so long as the relevant assets were assets of such Subsidiary
( provided, in the case of (B), that such Indebtedness is not subordinated in right of payment to the Securities);

-52

-----

(iii) to make payments with respect to the acquisition or license of intellectual property rights that are used in a Permitted Business;

(iv) to make a capital expenditure in or that is useful in a Permitted Business;

(v) to retire Securities pursuant to privately negotiated transactions, open market purchases or otherwise; or

(vi) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets (for the avoidance of doubt, including acquisitions of in-process
research and development) under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business.

Notwithstanding Sections 4.14(a) and 4.14(b), Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply an amount equal to any

Net Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Proceeds from all Asset Sales which are not applied
in accordance with this covenant exceed the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of receipt of such Net
Proceeds. Pending application of an amount equal to Net Proceeds pursuant to this Section 4.14, Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture.

(c) Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.14(b) hereof shall constitute “ Excess
**Proceeds .” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, the**
Company shall make an offer (an “ Asset Sale Offer ”) to all Holders of Securities and all holders of Parity Indebtedness to purchase the
maximum principal amount of Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds.
The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer shall be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and
shall be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
use the amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of
Securities and other Parity Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select
the Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

(d) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations

thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Securities pursuant to an Asset Sale
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of this Indenture, the
Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Asset Sale provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Section 4.15 Additional Subsidiary Guarantees . If any one of Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than the Company) that is not a Subsidiary
Guarantor Guarantees any Indebtedness of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, that Subsidiary shall (i) execute and deliver to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in form

-53

-----

which such Subsidiary shall unconditionally Guarantee, on a senior unsecured (unless the Securities are secured pursuant to Section 4.11) basis,
all of the Company’s obligations under the Securities and this Indenture on the terms set forth in this Indenture and, if applicable, the Canadian
Note Guarantee, and (ii) deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by such Subsidiary and constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of such Subsidiary. Thereafter, such Subsidiary
shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes hereof until such Subsidiary Guarantee is released in accordance herewith.

Section 4.16 Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries . Parent’s Board of Directors may designate any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than the Company) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. Any designation of a
Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be a designation of each of such entity’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned
by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to be an Investment made
as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.8 hereof or under one or more of
the clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments,” as determined by Parent. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment
would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Parent’s Board of
Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default and the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Parent would be greater than immediately prior to such redesignation.

Section 4.17 Business Activities . Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other
than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as would not be material to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 4.18 Payments for Consent . Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay
or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of Securities for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture relating to such Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is
paid to all Holders of the Securities that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to
such consent, waiver or agreement.

Section 4.19 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws . The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any
time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law or other law
which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities
as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this
Indenture, and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and
covenant that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will
suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Section 4.20 Escrow of Proceeds .

(a) The Company shall apply the Escrowed Property in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

-----

the Securities (the Issuance Escrow Proceeds ). The terms of the escrow will be set forth in the Escrow Agreement, pursuant to which the
Company will deposit with the Escrow Agent on the Issue Date the Issuance Escrow Proceeds, and the Company will deposit on the Issue Date
cash, in an amount sufficient to redeem, for cash, the Securities at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount of the
Securities being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities from the Issue Date up to and including January 15, 2013
(collectively, the “ Escrowed Property ”). The Company will grant the Trustee, for its benefit and for the benefit of the Escrow Agent and
Holders of the Securities, a first priority security interest in the escrow account (the “ Escrow Account ”) and all deposits therein to secure the
due and punctual payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price.

(c) The Company shall only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release to it portions of the Escrowed Property upon satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in the form of Release Officers’ Certificate included as Exhibit A to the Escrow Agreement, which shall be certified in
writing by the Company in each such Release Officers’ Certificate delivered to the Trustee and Escrow Agent contemporaneously with the
release of any Escrowed Property.

Section 4.21 Notice of Default . In the event that any Default or Event of Default under Section 6.1 hereof shall occur, the Company shall

give prompt written notice of such Default or Event of Default to the Trustee.

Section 4.22 Payment of Additional Amounts .

(a) All payments made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee by Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor organized other than in the
United States (each such person, a “ Payor ”) will be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty,
levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature (collectively, “ Tax ”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any
jurisdiction in which such Payor is organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or through which such Payor makes any
payment on its Note Guarantee or any department or political subdivision of any of the foregoing (each, a “ Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction ”),
unless such Payor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. For the avoidance of doubt, a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction shall not include
the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia. If a Payor is required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for or on
account of Taxes of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee, the Payor, subject
to the exceptions listed below, will pay additional amounts (“ Additional Amounts ”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
received by each Holder or beneficial owner of the Securities after such withholding or deduction (including withholding or deduction
attributable to Additional Amounts payable hereunder) will not be less than the amount the Holder or Beneficial Owner would have received if
such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted.

(b) A Payor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or Beneficial Owner of Securities:

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present

or former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any connection resulting from the acquisition, ownership, holding or
disposition of Securities, the receipt of payments thereunder or under any Note Guarantee and/or the exercise or enforcement of rights
under any Securities or any Note Guarantee);

-55

-----

Beneficial Owner of Securities, following the Company s or the Payor s written request addressed to the Holder, to the extent such
Holder or Beneficial Owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or Beneficial Owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction);

(iii) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales or any similar Taxes;

(iv) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the
Holder or beneficial owner of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on
which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(v) with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be made
pursuant to the European Council Directive on the taxation of savings income which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council on June 3,
2003 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive (the “ EU Savings Tax Directive
”) or is required to be made pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation dated October 26,
2004 providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the EU Savings Tax Directive (the “ EU-Swiss Savings Tax Agreement ”)
or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such agreement; or

(vi) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

(c) A Payor will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will make reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor
will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld are due pursuant to
applicable law, either a certified copy or tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts are not reasonably available to the Payor,
such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment by the Payor.

(d) Prior to the date on which the payment of any Additional Amounts are due, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee such Additional
Amounts payable together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable on the applicable payment date,
and setting forth the Additional Amounts so payable and will also set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such
Additional Amounts to Holders on the applicable payment date. Any such Officers’ Certificate will be delivered to the Trustee at least 2
Business Days in advance of when the payments in question are required to be made (unless a shorter period of time is acceptable to the
Trustee in its reasonable discretion). The Payor will promptly publish a notice in accordance with Section 11.2 hereof stating that such
Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

certified proof of payment for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such Holder in
connection with payments made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with respect to any
reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such Holder after such reimbursement will
not be less than the net amount such Holder would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or
(ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification obligation provided for in this Section 4.22(e) shall not extend to Taxes
imposed for which the Holder of the Securities would not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional Amounts hereunder by virtue of
clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 4.22(b) hereof, or to the extent such Holder received Additional Amounts with respect to such payments.

(f) In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties,
including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect of the execution,
issuance, registration or delivery of any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges
or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any payments made pursuant to the
Securities, any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the enforcement of any Note
Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder.

(g) The obligations described under this Section 4.22 will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to any Payor and to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia) in which such successor is organized, doing business or is otherwise resident for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction (other
than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) from or through which payment is made by such successor or its
respective agents.

(h) Whenever this Indenture refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable
under or with respect to any Security or under any Note Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts or other
payments that would be payable pursuant to this Section 4.22, if applicable.

Assumption, (v) redeeming the Securities on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, if applicable, and (vi) conducting such other activities as

(b) To the extent Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary has incurred Indebtedness, made any Restricted Payments, consummated any Asset
Sale or otherwise taken any action or engaged in any activities during the period beginning on the Issue Date and ending on the Assumption
Date, such actions and activities shall be treated and classified under this Indenture (including but not limited to impacting relevant baskets and
determining whether a Default or Event of Default would have occurred as of the Assumption Date for purposes of the release conditions in
Section 4.20(c)) as if this Indenture and the covenants set forth herein had applied to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries during such period.

the same shall become and be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in clause (h) or (i) of Section 6.1 hereof with
respect to Parent or the Company occurs, all unpaid principal (including, without limitation, any premium, if any), and accrued interest, if any,
on the Securities then outstanding shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part

would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; and (d) all payments due to the Trustee and any
predecessor Trustee under Section 7.7 hereof have been made. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereto.

available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the
performance of any provision of such Securities or this Indenture.

proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default

remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.4 Waiver of Defaults and Events of Default . Subject to Sections 6.7 and 9.2 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate

or any Default or Event of Default in respect of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities which, under Section 9.2 hereof, cannot be
modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. When a Default or Event of Default is waived, it is cured and
ceases.

Section 6.5 Control by Majority . The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct

the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy or power available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or
power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that the Trustee
determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Holder of Securities or the Trustee, or that may involve the Trustee in personal
liability unless the Trustee is offered indemnity satisfactory to it; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed
proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

Section 6.6 Limitations on Suits . A Holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities (except actions for

payment of overdue principal, premium, if any, or interest) unless:

(a) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;

(b) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Securities make a written request to the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(c) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable indemnity to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(c) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and

(d) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities.

A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over
such other Securityholder.

Section 6.7 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a

Security to receive payment of the principal of, or interest on the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security and this
Indenture and to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall
not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.

and other property which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization
or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to, or, on behalf of any
Holder, to authorize, accept or adopt any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights
of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party

no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 hereof until such time as the Trustee or such Paying Agent is permitted to apply all
such money or Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.5 hereof; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment
of the principal of or interest on any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of

Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may waive compliance in a particular instance by
the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities without notice to any Holder. However, notwithstanding the foregoing but

including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.4 hereof, may not:

(a) reduce the principal amount of such Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(b) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any such Security or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption

this Article 9 if the amendment or supplemental indenture does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If

NOTE GUARANTEES

Section 10.1 Note Guarantees .

(a) Each of the Note Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally Guarantees to each Holder of a Security authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the
Securities or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder that: (i) the due and punctual payment of principal, premium and interest
on the Securities shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, (ii) the due and
punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the
Company to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture or any Security shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with
the terms hereof and thereof, and (iii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations,
that same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any
performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Note Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each
Note Guarantor shall agree that this is a Guarantee of payment and not a Guarantee of collection.

(b) Each of the Note Guarantors hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to its Guarantee shall be joint and several, unconditional,
irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, the absence of any action
to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor with respect to this Indenture, the Securities or the
obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the Securities, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than
complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Note Guarantor. Each Note Guarantor
further, to the extent permitted by law, shall waive and relinquish all claims, rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors and
shall agree not to assert or take advantage of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (i) any right to require any of the
Trustee, the Holders or the Company (each a “ Benefited Party ”), as a condition of payment or performance by such Note Guarantor, to
(A) proceed against the Company, any other guarantor (including any other Note Guarantor) of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or
any other person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Company, any such other guarantor or any other person,
(C) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Benefited Party in favor of the Company
or any other person, or (D) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Benefited Party whatsoever; (ii) any defense arising by reason of the
incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of the Company including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of
validity or the unenforceability of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the
cessation of the liability of the Company from any cause other than payment in full of the obligations under the Note Guarantees; (iii) any
defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other
respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (iv) any defense based upon any Benefited Party’s errors or omissions in the
administration of the obligations under the Note Guarantees, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (v) (A) any principles or provisions
of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms of the Note Guarantees and any legal or equitable discharge of
such Note Guarantor’s obligations hereunder and under its Note Guarantee, (B) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Note
Guarantor’s liability hereunder and under its Note Guarantee or the enforcement hereof and thereof, (C) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and
counterclaims and (D)

property subject thereto; (vi) notices, demands, presentations, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or
inaction, including acceptance of the Note Guarantees, notices of default under the Securities or any agreement or instrument related thereto,
notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or any agreement related thereto, and notices of
any extension of credit to the Company and any right to consent to any thereof; (vii) to the extent permitted under applicable law, the benefits
of any “One Action” rule; and (viii) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or
exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of the Note Guarantees. Except as set forth in Section 10.5, each Note
Guarantor shall covenant that its Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in its
Note Guarantee and this Indenture.

(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any
custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Note Guarantors, any amount paid to either
the Trustee or such Holder, any Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.

(d) Each Note Guarantor shall agree that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any
obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Note Guarantor shall further agree that, as
between the Note Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations
guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 hereof for the purposes of any Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (ii) in the event of any
declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 6.2 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
forthwith become due and payable by the Note Guarantors for the purpose of any such Guarantee. The Note Guarantors shall have the right to
seek contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders
under the applicable Guarantee.

Section 10.2 Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantees . To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.1 hereof, each Note
Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto shall be endorsed by an officer of
such Note Guarantor on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such
Note Guarantor by any of its Officers. Each of the Note Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in
Section 10.1 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of such Note
Guarantee. If an officer or Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Note Guarantee of a Note Guarantor no longer holds that
office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security on which the Note Guarantee of such Note Guarantor is endorsed, the Note Guarantee
of such Note Guarantor shall be valid nevertheless. The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall
constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantees set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Note Guarantors.

Section 10.3 Limitation on Note Guarantor Liability . Each Note Guarantor shall confirm, and by its acceptance of Securities, each

Holder hereby confirms, that it is the intention of all such parties that any Guarantee of such Note Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer
or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar
applicable law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee and the Holders irrevocably
agree, and the Note Guarantors shall irrevocably agree, that the obligations of such Note Guarantor under this Article 10 shall be limited to the
maximum amount

-76

-----

such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other
Note Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Note Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary
Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Section 10.4 Merger and Consolidation of Note Guarantors .

(a) In case of any sale or other disposition, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor person,
by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note Guarantee endorsed upon
the Securities and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Note
Guarantor, such successor person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Note Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein
as a Note Guarantor. Such successor person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the
Securities available hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note
Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and
thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the
execution hereof.

(b) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clause (a) of this Section 10.4, nothing contained in this Indenture
or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Note Guarantor with or into the Company or another Note Guarantor,
or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Note Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or
another Note Guarantor.

Section 10.5 Release .

(a) In the event (i) of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case to
a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transactions) a Subsidiary of Parent, so long as the Net Proceeds of such sale or
other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.14 hereof,
(ii) of a designation by Parent of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
definition thereof, (iii) upon the release or discharge of any Note Guarantee in respect of any Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the
Issue Date of the Note Guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor or (iv) the Company discharges this Indenture under Section 8.1 or exercises its
legal or covenant defeasance options under Section 8.2 or 8.3, respectively, such Subsidiary Guarantor or, in the case of a sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Person acquiring such property, shall be released and
relieved of any obligations under its Guarantee without any further action being required by the Trustee or any Holder. If the Company
discharges this Indenture under Section 8.1 or exercises its legal or covenant defeasance options under Section 8.2 or 8.3, respectively, Parent
shall be released and relieved of any obligations under its Note Guarantee without any further action being required by the Trustee or any
Holder.

other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.8

issued under an Indenture dated as of October 4, 2012 (together with any supplemental indentures thereto, the “ Indenture ”), among Parent,

5. OPTIONAL REDEMPTION; PURCHASE OF NOTES AT OPTION OF HOLDER; SPECIAL MANDATORY REDEMPTION.

(a) Optional Redemption . The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at the prices, and upon the terms and conditions, set
forth in Section 3.7 of the Indenture.

(b) Repurchase at Option of Holder . If there is a Change of Control, the Company shall be required to make an offer (a “ Change of
**Control Offer ”) to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of each Holder’s Notes at a**
purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the

amount of Notes and other Parity Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, Parent (or such
Restricted Subsidiary) may use such deficiency for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of
Notes and other Parity Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select the
Notes and other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Holders of Notes that are the subject of an offer to purchase will

the date of such notice, as applicable (such date, the “ Special Mandatory Redemption Date ”), redeem all of the Securities (the “ Special
**Mandatory Redemption ”) at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest**
from the Issue Date (the “ Special Mandatory Redemption Price ”). Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be mailed by the
Company promptly to each Holder at its registered address, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent.

Mandatory Redemption Price no later than the last Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. On the Special Mandatory

applied towards a Special Mandatory Redemption shall be paid to the Company upon the Company’s written request in accordance with the

Agent have any responsibility for determining or verifying the accuracy of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price.

each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes in denominations larger than $2,000 may be redeemed in part but

to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes or other governmental charges that may be imposed in
relation thereto by law or permitted by the Indenture.

Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.

the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, and an existing default or Event of Default and
its consequence or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived in a particular instance with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Without the consent of or notice to any Holder, the
Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture (with respect to the Notes) or the Notes to, among other things, cure any
ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder.

indebtedness of Parent, the Company or a Significant Subsidiary; (v) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Parent, the
Company or any Significant Subsidiary and (vi) certain other events described in the Indenture. If an Event of Default (other than as a result of
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Parent or the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare all unpaid principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest,
if any, to the date of acceleration on the Notes then outstanding to be due and payable immediately, all as and to the extent provided in the
Indenture. If an Event of Default occurs as a result of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Parent or the Company,
unpaid principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the Notes then outstanding shall become due and payable immediately
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, all as and to the extent provided in the Indenture. Holders may not
enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces
the Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a
default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company is required to file periodic
reports with the Trustee as to the absence of default.

limiting the time for which an action may be commenced shall be excluded from application to the obligations of Guarantor hereunder to fullest
extent permitted by such Act or applicable law.

**3.2. Usury Savings Clause**

If any provision of this Canadian Note Guarantee, the Indenture or any Security would obligate any Canadian Note Guarantor to make any
payment of or on account of interest or other amount in an amount or calculated at a rate which would result in a receipt by any Holder of
interest at a criminal rate (as such term is construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then notwithstanding such provisions, such amount or
rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not
so result in a receipt by such Holder of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1) firstly,
by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such Holder, and (2) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums
and other amounts required to be paid to such Holder which would constitute “interest” for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code
(Canada).

**3.3. Interest Act (Canada)**

For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or fees
provided for in this Canadian Note Guarantee, the Indenture or the Securities (and stated herein or therein, as applicable, to be computed on the
basis of a 360 day year or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent are the rates so provided for multiplied by the actual
number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 360 or the actual number of days in such other period of time, respectively.

**3.4. Counterparts; Execution**

This Canadian Note Guarantee may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which,
when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Canadian Note Guarantee facsimile or other similar method of electronic transmission
(including by way of email attachment) shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Canadian Note
Guarantee.

**3.5. Severability**

If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Canadian Note Guarantee or its application to any party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited or
unenforceable, such provision shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such restriction, prohibition or unenforceability
without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Canadian Note Guarantee and without affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction or without affecting its application to other parties or circumstances.

All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, sent, or delivered in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture.

**3.7. Successors**

This Canadian Note Guarantee shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and shall inure to the benefit of the successors of the
Beneficiaries.

**3.8. Judgment Currency**

Guarantor shall indemnify each Holder and each Person, if any, who controls any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any loss incurred by such party as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against
Guarantor for any U.S. dollar amount due under this Canadian Note Guarantee and such judgment or order being expressed and paid in a
currency (the “ Judgment Currency ”) other than U.S. dollars and as a result of any variation as between (i) the rate of exchange at which the
U.S. dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the spot rate of exchange in The
City of New York at which such party on the date of payment of such judgment or order is able to purchase U.S. dollars with the amount of the
Judgment Currency actually received by such party if such party had utilized such amount of Judgment Currency to purchase U.S. dollars upon
such party’s receipt thereof. Any amount due from Guarantor under this Section 3.8 shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by
such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term “spot rate of exchange” shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection
with the purchase of, or conversion into, U.S. dollars.

**3.9. Payment of Additional Amounts**

(a) All payments made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee by Guarantor will be made free and clear of any withholding

**Tax ”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of Canada or any department or political subdivision thereof (each, a “ Relevant Taxing**
**Jurisdiction ”), unless Guarantor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If Guarantor is required by law to withhold or deduct**
any amount for or on account of Taxes of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to this
Canadian Note Guarantee, Guarantor, subject to the exceptions listed below, will pay additional amounts (“ Additional Amounts ”) as
may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Holder or beneficial owner of the Securities after such withholding or
deduction (including withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts payable hereunder) will not be less than the amount
the Holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted.

(b) Guarantor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or Beneficial Owner of Securities:

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member or shareholder of,
or possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any connection resulting from the acquisition, ownership, holding or
disposition of Securities, the receipt of payments thereunder or under this Canadian Note Guarantee and/or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under any Securities or this Canadian Note Guarantee);

Beneficial Owner of Securities, following Guarantor s written request addressed to the Holder, to the extent such Holder or
Beneficial Owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or Beneficial Owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction);

(iii) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales or any similar Taxes;

or beneficial owner of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which
payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(v) with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be made pursuant
to the European Council Directive on the taxation of savings income which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council on June 3, 2003

”) or is required to be made pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation dated
October 26, 2004 providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the EU Savings Tax Directive (the “ EU-Swiss Savings
**Tax Agreement ”) or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform**
to, such agreement; or

(vi) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

(c) Guarantor will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld
to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. Guarantor will make reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such
Taxes. Guarantor will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
are due pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy or tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts are not
reasonably available to Guarantor, such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment by Guarantor.

(d) Prior to the date on which the payment of any Additional Amounts are due, Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee such Additional
Amounts payable together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable on the applicable payment
date, and setting forth the Additional Amounts so payable and will also set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to

(e) Guarantor will reimburse the Holders of Securities, upon written request of such Holder of Securities and certified proof of payment for
the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such Holder in connection with
payments made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with respect to any
reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such Holder after such reimbursement
will not be less than the net amount such Holder would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the reimbursement described in
clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification obligation provided for in this Section 3.9(e)
shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the Holder of the Securities would not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional
Amounts hereunder by virtue of clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 3.9(b) hereof, or to the extent such Holder received Additional
Amounts with respect to such payments.

(f) In addition, Guarantor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties,
including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect of the execution,
issuance, registration or delivery of this Canadian Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder and any
such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any
payments made pursuant to the Securities, any Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the
enforcement of this Canadian Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder.

(g) The obligations described under this Section 3.9 will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and will apply
mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to Guarantor and to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia) in which such successor is organized, doing business or is otherwise resident for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction

require in connection with the delivery by such Registrar of Securities upon transfer or exchange of Securities.

(d) The restrictions imposed by the Legend upon the transferability of any Security shall cease and terminate when such Security has been

sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or transferred in compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act
(or any successor provision thereto) or, if earlier, upon the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales thereof under Rule 144(d)(1)(ii)

with their terms or shall have terminated may, upon a surrender of such Security for exchange to the Registrar in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.12 (accompanied, in the event that such restrictions on transfer have terminated by reason of a transfer in
compliance with Rule 144 or any successor provision, by, if requested by the Company or the Registrar, an opinion of counsel reasonably

part for a Security registered in the name of any Person other than the Depositary or one or more nominees thereof, provided that a Global
Security may be exchanged for Securities registered in the names of any person designated by the Depositary in the event that (A) the
Depositary (x) has notified the obligors that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (y) such
Depositary has ceased to be a “clearing agency” registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not
appointed by the obligors within 90 days after receipt of such notice or the Company becomes aware of such failure of registration or

(A) above shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part, and any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (B) may be exchanged in
whole or from time to time in part as directed by the Depositary. Any Security issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion
thereof shall be a Global Security; provided that any such Security so issued that is registered in the name of a Person other than the
Depositary or a nominee thereof shall not be a Global Security.

portion thereof to be so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of the Trustee. Upon any such surrender
or adjustment, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Security issuable on such exchange to or upon the order of the Depositary or
an authorized representative thereof.

Trustee a reasonable supply of Definitive Securities in definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons.

(v) Neither Agent members nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may act shall have any rights under this
Indenture with respect to any Global Security registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, or under any such Global
Security, and the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the
Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any
written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between
the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an Agent Member may act, the operation of customary
practices of such Persons governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.

or as contained in any notice of a purchase and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities,
and any such purchase shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of
any change in the “CUSIP” and “ISIN” numbers.

notice period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) of the Redemption Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed and

Affiliate thereof, sufficient to pay the installment. Except in the case of a redemption, a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer,

rate applicable to the Security plus 1% per annum, which interest shall be payable on demand.

The Company will make payments in respect of the Securities represented by the Global Securities (including principal, premium, if any,
and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holder of the Global Security. The Company will
make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Definitive Securities by wire transfer of immediately available

notes of $1,000,000 or more, or, if no such account is specified or in the case of a Holder holding an aggregate principal amount of notes of less
than $1,000,000, by mailing a check to each such Holder’s registered address. All payments shall be made in immediately available funds in
such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
Payments to any Holder holding an aggregate principal amount of Securities in excess of $1,000,000 shall be made by wire transfer in

exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company
shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the

rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any
change in the location of any such other office or agency.

format that is accessible to Holders of Securities as well as prospective Holders of Securities), within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and regulations:

(i) all quarterly and annual reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if Parent were required

periods specified above unless the SEC will not accept such a filing. Parent agrees that it shall not take any action for the purpose of causing
the SEC not to accept any such filings. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept the Parent’s filings for any reason, Parent
shall post the reports referred to in Section 4.3(a) hereof on its website within the time periods that would apply if Parent were required to file
those reports with the SEC.

whether clause 4.3(d) has been satisfied, nor shall it have any liability in connection therewith.

(e) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of

such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including
the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers’
Certificates).

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Parent fails to comply with its obligation to file or provide such
information, documents and reports as required by this Section 4.3, Parent will be deemed to have cured such Default for purposes of
Section 6.1(d) upon the filing or provision of all such information, documents and reports required hereunder prior to the expiration of 60 days

Default or Event of Default. If such signer knows of such a Default or Event of Default, the Officers’ Certificate shall describe the Default or
Event of Default and the efforts to remedy the same. For the purposes of this Section 4.4, compliance shall be determined without regard to any
grace period or requirement of notice provided pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.

dissolved, such Subsidiary has no assets.

Section 4.7 Changes in Covenants When Securities Rated Investment Grade . In the event of the occurrence of a Fall Away Event (and
notwithstanding the failure of Parent subsequently to maintain an Investment Grade Rating), the provisions of Sections 4.8, 4.9, 4.12, 4.13 and
4.14 hereof and clause (iv) of Section 5.1(a) hereof will no longer be applicable to the Securities.

(A) any liabilities, as shown on Parent’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other

assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to an agreement that releases Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from

at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated
Total Assets.

those Net Proceeds:

(i) to repay Indebtedness and other Obligations under (A) a Credit Facility and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit

Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, (B) other secured Indebtedness or (C) other Indebtedness of a
Subsidiary (other than the Company) that does not Guarantee the Securities, so long as the relevant assets were assets of such Subsidiary
( provided, in the case of (B), that such Indebtedness is not subordinated in right of payment to the Securities);

(ii) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted Business;

(iii) to make payments with respect to the acquisition or license of intellectual property rights that are used in a Permitted Business;

(vi) to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets (for the avoidance of doubt, including acquisitions of in-process
research and development) under GAAP and that are used or useful in a Permitted Business.

Notwithstanding Sections 4.14(a) and 4.14(b), Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply an amount equal to any

Net Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Proceeds from all Asset Sales which are not applied
in accordance with this covenant exceed the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of receipt of such Net
Proceeds. Pending application of an amount equal to Net Proceeds pursuant to this Section 4.14, Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture.

(c) Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in Section 4.14(b) hereof shall constitute “ Excess
**Proceeds .” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of $100.0 million or 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, the**
Company shall make an offer (an “ Asset Sale Offer ”) to all Holders of Securities and all holders of Parity Indebtedness to purchase the
maximum principal amount of Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the amount of such Excess Proceeds.
The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer shall be equal to 100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and
shall be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
use the amount of such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of
Securities and other Parity Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select
the Securities and such other Parity Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

(d) The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations

thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Securities pursuant to an Asset Sale
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of this

obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of this Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Section 4.15 Additional Subsidiary Guarantees . If any one of Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than the Company) that is not a Subsidiary
Guarantor Guarantees any Indebtedness of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, that Subsidiary shall (i) execute and deliver to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and, if such Subsidiary of Parent is a Canadian Note Guarantor, a
Canadian Note Guarantee, pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall unconditionally Guarantee, on a senior unsecured (unless the Securities are
secured pursuant to Section 4.11) basis, all of the Company’s obligations under the Securities and this Indenture on the terms set forth in this
Indenture and, if applicable, the Canadian Note Guarantee, and (ii) deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that such supplemental
indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Subsidiary and constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of such Subsidiary. Thereafter, such Subsidiary shall be a Subsidiary Guarantor for all purposes hereof until such Subsidiary
Guarantee is released in accordance herewith.

Section 4.16 Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries . Parent’s Board of Directors may designate any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than the Company) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. Any designation of a
Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be a designation of each of such entity’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned
by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to be an Investment made
as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.8 hereof or under one or more of
the clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments,” as determined by Parent. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment
would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Parent’s Board of
Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default and the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Parent would be greater than immediately prior to such redesignation.

Section 4.17 Business Activities . Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other
than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as would not be material to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 4.18 Payments for Consent . Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay
or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of Securities for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture relating to such Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is
paid to all Holders of the Securities that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to
such consent, waiver or agreement.

Section 4.19 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws . The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any
time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law or other law
which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities
as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this
Indenture, and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and
covenant that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will
suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

Section 4.21 Notice of Default . In the event that any Default or Event of Default under Section 6.1 hereof shall occur, the Company shall

give prompt written notice of such Default or Event of Default to the Trustee.

Section 4.22 Payment of Additional Amounts .

(a) All payments made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee by Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor organized other than in the
United States (each such person, a “ Payor ”) will be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty,
levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature (collectively, “ Tax ”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any
jurisdiction in which such Payor is organized, resident or doing business for tax purposes or from or through which such Payor makes any
payment on its Note Guarantee or any department or political subdivision of any of the foregoing (each, a “ Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction ”),
unless such Payor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. For the avoidance of doubt, a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction shall not include
the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia. If a Payor is required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for or on
account of Taxes of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee, the Payor, subject
to the exceptions listed below, will pay additional amounts (“ Additional Amounts ”) as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
received by each Holder or beneficial owner of the Securities after such withholding or deduction (including withholding or deduction
attributable to Additional Amounts payable hereunder) will not be less than the amount the Holder or Beneficial Owner would have received if
such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted.

(b) A Payor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or Beneficial Owner of Securities:

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present

or former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any connection resulting from the acquisition, ownership, holding or
disposition of Securities, the receipt of payments thereunder or under any Note Guarantee and/or the exercise or enforcement of rights
under any Securities or any Note Guarantee);

(ii) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the failure of the Holder or
Beneficial Owner of Securities, following the Company’s or the Payor’s written request addressed to the Holder, to the extent such
Holder or Beneficial Owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or Beneficial Owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction);

(iii) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales or any similar Taxes;

-54

-----

Holder or beneficial owner of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on
which payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(v) with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be made
pursuant to the European Council Directive on the taxation of savings income which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council on June 3,
2003 or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive (the “ EU Savings Tax Directive
”) or is required to be made pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation dated October 26,
2004 providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the EU Savings Tax Directive (the “ EU-Swiss Savings Tax Agreement ”)
or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such agreement; or

(vi) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

(c) A Payor will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will make reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes. The Payor
will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld are due pursuant to
applicable law, either a certified copy or tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts are not reasonably available to the Payor,
such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment by the Payor.

(d) Prior to the date on which the payment of any Additional Amounts are due, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee such Additional
Amounts payable together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable on the applicable payment date,
and setting forth the Additional Amounts so payable and will also set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such
Additional Amounts to Holders on the applicable payment date. Any such Officers’ Certificate will be delivered to the Trustee at least 2
Business Days in advance of when the payments in question are required to be made (unless a shorter period of time is acceptable to the
Trustee in its reasonable discretion). The Payor will promptly publish a notice in accordance with Section 11.2 hereof stating that such
Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

(e) The Payors, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Holders of Securities, upon written request of such Holder of Securities and
certified proof of payment for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such Holder in
connection with payments made under or with respect to any Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with respect to any
reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such Holder after such reimbursement will
not be less than the net amount such Holder would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the reimbursement described in clauses (i) and/or
(ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification obligation provided for in this Section 4.22(e) shall not extend to Taxes
imposed for which the Holder of the Securities would not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional Amounts hereunder by virtue of
clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 4.22(b) hereof, or to the extent such Holder received Additional Amounts with respect to such payments.

(f) In addition, the Payor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties,
including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed

-55

other document or instrument referred to thereunder and any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any
time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any payments made pursuant to the Securities, any Note Guarantee or any other such document or
instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the enforcement of any Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to
thereunder.

(g) The obligations described under this Section 4.22 will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to any Payor and to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia) in which such successor is organized, doing business or is otherwise resident for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction (other
than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) from or through which payment is made by such successor or its
respective agents.

(h) Whenever this Indenture refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable
under or with respect to any Security or under any Note Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts or other
payments that would be payable pursuant to this Section 4.22, if applicable.

Section 4.23 Exchange Offer . Parent, Valeant and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate
the Exchange Offer within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the consummation of the Medicis Acquisition and the assumption by Valeant
of the obligations of VPI Escrow Corp. under the Escrow Indenture. Nothwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the notes offered under
the Escrow Corp. Indenture are mandatorily redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Corp. Indenture in the event that the Medicis
Acquisition is not being consummated, no Exchange Offer will be conducted.

occurs, all unpaid principal (including, without limitation, any premium, if any), and accrued interest, if any, on the Securities then outstanding
shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and
its consequences if (a) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of the Securities which has become due solely
by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived; (b) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest at a rate of
1% per annum over the amount of interest otherwise payable on such Securities on overdue installments of interest and overdue principal,
which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid; (c) the rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; and (d) all payments due to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 7.7
hereof have been made. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereto.

Section 6.3 Other Remedies . If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, pursue any
available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the
performance of any provision of such Securities or this Indenture.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the
proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default
shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other
remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.4 Waiver of Defaults and Events of Default . Subject to Sections 6.7 and 9.2 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences, except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Securities when due
or any Default or Event of Default in respect of any provision of this Indenture or the Securities which, under Section 9.2 hereof, cannot be
modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. When a Default or Event of Default is waived, it is cured and
ceases.

Section 6.5 Control by Majority . The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may direct

the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy or power available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or
power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that the Trustee
determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Holder of Securities or the Trustee, or that may involve the Trustee in personal
liability unless the Trustee is offered indemnity satisfactory to it; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed
proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

Section 6.6 Limitations on Suits . A Holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities (except actions for

payment of overdue principal, premium, if any, or interest) unless:

(a) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;

-60

-----

Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(c) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable indemnity to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(c) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and

(d) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities.

A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over
such other Securityholder.

Section 6.7 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a

Security to receive payment of the principal of, or interest on the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security and this
Indenture and to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, is absolute and unconditional and shall
not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.

Section 6.8 Collection Suit by Trustee . If an Event of Default in the payment of principal or interest specified in clause (a) or (b) of
Section 6.1 hereof occurs and is continuing with respect to any Securities, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of
an express trust against the Company or another obligor on the Securities for the whole amount of principal and accrued interest remaining
unpaid, together with, to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue principal and overdue installments of interest, in
each case at a rate equal to the interest rate then in effect on such Security plus 1% per annum and such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its
agents and counsel.

Section 6.9 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim . The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the
Company (or any other obligor on the Securities), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any
money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any Custodian in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the
making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7 hereof, and to the
extent that such payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances in any such proceedings shall be denied for
any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities
and other property which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization
or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to, or, on behalf of any
Holder, to authorize, accept or adopt any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights
of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

_First, to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.7 hereof;_

_Second, to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for principal and interest ratably, without preference or priority of_
any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for principal and interest respectively; and

_Third, the balance, if any, to the Company._

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10.

Section 6.11 Undertaking for Costs . In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the
Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party
litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit made by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.7 hereof, or a suit by Holders
of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding.

money notice that such money remains unclaimed and that after a date specified therein, which shall be at least 30 days from the date of such
mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled
to money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.

prohibiting such application, then the Company’s obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though
no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 hereof until such time as the Trustee or such Paying Agent is permitted to apply all
such money or Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.5 hereof; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment
of the principal of or interest on any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of
the Holders of such Securities to receive any such payment from the money or Government Securities held by the Trustee or such Paying
Agent.

(f) to conform the text of this Indenture or the Securities to any provision of the section of the Offering Memorandum dated

supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under Section 9.1 or this Section 9.2 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the
Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or
any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver.

Section 9.3 [Reserved] .

Section 9.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents . Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a

Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as
the consenting Holder’s Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder
may revoke the consent as to its Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment,
supplement or waiver becomes effective.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of
clauses (a) through (i) of Section 9.2 hereof. In that case the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has
consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s
Security.

Section 9.5 Notation on or Exchange of Securities . If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee
may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the
changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the
Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms.

Section 9.6 Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc . The Trustee shall sign any amendment or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to
this Article 9 if the amendment or supplemental indenture does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If
it does, the Trustee may, in its sole discretion, but need not sign it. In signing or refusing to sign such amendment or supplemental indenture,
the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject to Section 7.1 hereof, shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating
that such amendment or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and all conditions precedent in this Indenture to
such execution have been complied with. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental indenture until its Board of Directors
approves it.

Section 9.7 Effect of Supplemental Indentures . Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall
be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of
Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.

NOTE GUARANTEES

Section 10.1 Note Guarantees .

(a) Each of the Note Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby unconditionally Guarantees to each Holder of a Security authenticated and
delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the
Securities or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder that: (i) the due and punctual payment of principal, premium and interest
on the Securities shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, (ii) the due and
punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the
Company to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture or any Security shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with
the terms hereof and thereof, and (iii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations,
that same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any
performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Note Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each
Note Guarantor shall agree that this is a Guarantee of payment and not a Guarantee of collection.

(b) Each of the Note Guarantors hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to its Guarantee shall be joint and several, unconditional,
irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Securities or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, the absence of any action
to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor with respect to this Indenture, the Securities or the
obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the Securities, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than
complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Note Guarantor. Each Note Guarantor
further, to the extent permitted by law, shall waive and relinquish all claims, rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors and
shall agree not to assert or take advantage of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (i) any right to require any of the
Trustee, the Holders or the Company (each a “ Benefited Party ”), as a condition of payment or performance by such Note Guarantor, to
(A) proceed against the Company, any other guarantor (including any other Note Guarantor) of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or
any other person, (B) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Company, any such other guarantor or any other person,
(C) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Benefited Party in favor of the Company
or any other person, or (D) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Benefited Party whatsoever; (ii) any defense arising by reason of the
incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of the Company including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of
validity or the unenforceability of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the
cessation of the liability of the Company from any cause other than payment in full of the obligations under the Note Guarantees; (iii) any
defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other
respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (iv) any defense based upon any Benefited Party’s errors or omissions in the
administration of the obligations under the Note Guarantees, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (v) (A) any principles or provisions
of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms of the Note Guarantees and any legal or equitable discharge of
such Note Guarantor’s obligations hereunder and under its Note Guarantee, (B) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Note
Guarantor’s liability hereunder and under its Note Guarantee or the enforcement hereof and thereof, (C) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and
counterclaims and (D)

-73

-----

property subject thereto; (vi) notices, demands, presentations, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or
inaction, including acceptance of the Note Guarantees, notices of default under the Securities or any agreement or instrument related thereto,
notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the obligations under the Note Guarantees or any agreement related thereto, and notices of
any extension of credit to the Company and any right to consent to any thereof; (vii) to the extent permitted under applicable law, the benefits
of any “One Action” rule; and (viii) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or
exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of the Note Guarantees. Except as set forth in Section 10.5, each Note
Guarantor shall covenant that its Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in its
Note Guarantee and this Indenture.

(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any
custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Note Guarantors, any amount paid to either
the Trustee or such Holder, any Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.

(d) Each Note Guarantor shall agree that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any
obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Note Guarantor shall further agree that, as
between the Note Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations
guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.2 hereof for the purposes of any Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (ii) in the event of any
declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 6.2 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
forthwith become due and payable by the Note Guarantors for the purpose of any such Guarantee. The Note Guarantors shall have the right to
seek contribution from any non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders
under the applicable Guarantee.

Section 10.2 Execution and Delivery of Note Guarantees . To evidence its Guarantee set forth in Section 10.1 hereof, each Note
Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Note Guarantee substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto shall be endorsed by an officer of
such Note Guarantor on each Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such
Note Guarantor by any of its Officers. Each of the Note Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in
Section 10.1 hereof shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of such Note
Guarantee. If an officer or Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Note Guarantee of a Note Guarantor no longer holds that
office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security on which the Note Guarantee of such Note Guarantor is endorsed, the Note Guarantee
of such Note Guarantor shall be valid nevertheless. The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall
constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantees set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Note Guarantors.

Section 10.3 Limitation on Note Guarantor Liability . Each Note Guarantor shall confirm, and by its acceptance of Securities, each

Holder hereby confirms, that it is the intention of all such parties that any Guarantee of such Note Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer
or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar
applicable law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee and the Holders irrevocably
agree, and the Note Guarantors shall irrevocably agree, that the obligations of such Note Guarantor under this Article 10 shall be limited to the
maximum amount

-74

-----

such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other
Note Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Note Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary
Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Section 10.4 Merger and Consolidation of Note Guarantors .

(a) In case of any sale or other disposition, consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor person,
by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note Guarantee endorsed upon
the Securities and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Note
Guarantor, such successor person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Note Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein
as a Note Guarantor. Such successor person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the
Securities available hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note
Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and
thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the
execution hereof.

(b) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clause (a) of this Section 10.4, nothing contained in this Indenture
or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Note Guarantor with or into the Company or another Note Guarantor,
or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Note Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or
another Note Guarantor.

Section 10.5 Release .

(a) In the event (i) of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Subsidiary Guarantor, by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case to
a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transactions) a Subsidiary of Parent, so long as the Net Proceeds of such sale or
other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.14 hereof,
(ii) of a designation by Parent of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
definition thereof, (iii) upon the release or discharge of any Note Guarantee in respect of any Indebtedness that resulted in the issuance after the
Issue Date of the Note Guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor or (iv) the Company discharges this Indenture under Section 8.1 or exercises its
legal or covenant defeasance options under Section 8.2 or 8.3, respectively, such Subsidiary Guarantor or, in the case of a sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Person acquiring such property, shall be released and
relieved of any obligations under its Guarantee without any further action being required by the Trustee or any Holder. If the Company
discharges this Indenture under Section 8.1 or exercises its legal or covenant defeasance options under Section 8.2 or 8.3, respectively, Parent
shall be released and relieved of any obligations under its Note Guarantee without any further action being required by the Trustee or any
Holder.

(b) Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or
other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.8
hereof, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor from its
obligations under its Guarantee.

on the date the Indebtedness was incurred or other transaction was entered into; provided that if any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars is incurred to refinance Indebtedness denominated in the same currency, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness shall be deemed not to exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced.

Indenture. If an Event of Default occurs as a result of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of Parent or the Company,
unpaid principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the Notes then outstanding shall become due and payable immediately
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, all as and to the extent provided in the Indenture. Holders may not
enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to it before it enforces
the Indenture or the Notes. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a
default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests. The Company is required to file periodic
reports with the Trustee as to the absence of default.

obligations of the Company or any Note Guarantor under the Notes or the Indenture nor for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of
such obligations or their creation. The Holder of this Note by accepting this Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release

shall agree not to assert or take advantage of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (i) any right to require any

Any and all limitation periods provided for in the Limitations Act, 2002 (Ontario), as amended from time to time, or any other applicable law
limiting the time for which an action may be commenced shall be excluded from application to the obligations of Guarantor hereunder to fullest
extent permitted by such Act or applicable law.

**3.2. Usury Savings Clause**

If any provision of this Canadian Note Guarantee, the Indenture or any Security would obligate any Canadian Note Guarantor to make any
payment of or on account of interest or other amount in an amount or calculated at a rate which would result in a receipt by any Holder of
interest at a criminal rate (as such term is construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then notwithstanding such provisions, such amount or
rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not
so result in a receipt by such Holder of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (1) firstly,
by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such Holder, and (2) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums
and other amounts required to be paid to such Holder which would constitute “interest” for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code
(Canada).

**3.3. Interest Act (Canada)**

For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or fees
provided for in this Canadian Note Guarantee, the Indenture or the Securities (and stated herein or therein, as applicable, to be computed on the
basis of a 360 day year or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent are the rates so provided for multiplied by the actual
number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 360 or the actual number of days in such other period of time, respectively.

**3.4. Counterparts; Execution**

This Canadian Note Guarantee may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which,
when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Canadian Note Guarantee facsimile or other similar method of electronic transmission
(including by way of email attachment) shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Canadian Note
Guarantee.

**3.5. Severability**

If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Canadian Note Guarantee or its application to any party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited or
unenforceable, such provision shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such restriction, prohibition or unenforceability
without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Canadian Note Guarantee and without affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction or without affecting its application to other parties or circumstances.

All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be mailed, sent, or delivered in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture.

**3.7. Successors**

This Canadian Note Guarantee shall be binding upon Guarantor and its successors and shall inure to the benefit of the successors of the
Beneficiaries.

**3.8. Judgment Currency**

Guarantor shall indemnify each Holder and each Person, if any, who controls any Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any loss incurred by such party as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against
Guarantor for any U.S. dollar amount due under this Canadian Note Guarantee and such judgment or order being expressed and paid in a
currency (the “ Judgment Currency ”) other than U.S. dollars and as a result of any variation as between (i) the rate of exchange at which the
U.S. dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the spot rate of exchange in The
City of New York at which such party on the date of payment of such judgment or order is able to purchase U.S. dollars with the amount of the
Judgment Currency actually received by such party if such party had utilized such amount of Judgment Currency to purchase U.S. dollars upon
such party’s receipt thereof. Any amount due from Guarantor under this Section 3.8 shall be due as a separate debt and shall not be affected by
such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term “spot rate of exchange” shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection
with the purchase of, or conversion into, U.S. dollars.

**3.9. Payment of Additional Amounts**

(a) All payments made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee by Guarantor will be made free and clear of any withholding
or deduction for or on account of any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of whatever nature (collectively, “
**Tax ”) imposed or levied by or on behalf of Canada or any department or political subdivision thereof (each, a “ Relevant Taxing**
**Jurisdiction ”), unless Guarantor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If Guarantor is required by law to withhold or deduct**
any amount for or on account of Taxes of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to this
Canadian Note Guarantee, Guarantor, subject to the exceptions listed below, will pay additional amounts (“ Additional Amounts ”) as
may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Holder or beneficial owner of the Securities after such withholding or
deduction (including withholding or deduction attributable to Additional Amounts payable hereunder) will not be less than the amount
the Holder or beneficial owner would have received if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted.

(b) Guarantor will not, however, pay Additional Amounts to a Holder or Beneficial Owner of Securities:

(i) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or
former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, member or shareholder of,
or possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than any connection resulting from the acquisition, ownership, holding or
disposition of Securities, the receipt of payments thereunder or under this Canadian Note Guarantee and/or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under any Securities or this Canadian Note Guarantee);

D-6


-----

Beneficial Owner of Securities, following Guarantor s written request addressed to the Holder, to the extent such Holder or
Beneficial Owner is legally eligible to do so, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder or Beneficial Owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction);

(iii) with respect to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales or any similar Taxes;

(iv) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the Holder

or beneficial owner of any Security, where presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which
payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(v) with respect to any withholding or deduction that is imposed on a payment to an individual and that is required to be made pursuant
to the European Council Directive on the taxation of savings income which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council on June 3, 2003
or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive (the “ EU Savings Tax Directive
”) or is required to be made pursuant to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation dated
October 26, 2004 providing for measures equivalent to those laid down in the EU Savings Tax Directive (the “ EU-Swiss Savings
**Tax Agreement ”) or any law or other governmental regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform**
to, such agreement; or

(vi) any combination of items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

(c) Guarantor will (i) make any such withholding or deduction required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld
to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. Guarantor will make reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such
Taxes. Guarantor will provide to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
are due pursuant to applicable law, either a certified copy or tax receipts evidencing such payment, or, if such tax receipts are not
reasonably available to Guarantor, such other documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment by Guarantor.

(d) Prior to the date on which the payment of any Additional Amounts are due, Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee such Additional
Amounts payable together with an Officers’ Certificate stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable on the applicable payment
date, and setting forth the Additional Amounts so payable and will also set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to
pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the applicable payment date. Any such Officers’ Certificate will be delivered to the Trustee

the Indenture stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the obligation to pay such amounts.

(e) Guarantor will reimburse the Holders of Securities, upon written request of such Holder of Securities and certified proof of payment for
the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and payable by such Holder in connection with
payments made under or with respect to this Canadian Note Guarantee; and (ii) any Taxes levied or imposed with respect to any
reimbursement under the foregoing clause (i) or this clause (ii), so that the net amount received by such Holder after such reimbursement
will not be less than the net amount such Holder would have received if the Taxes giving rise to the reimbursement described in
clauses (i) and/or (ii) had not been imposed, provided, however, that the indemnification obligation provided for in this Section 3.9(e)
shall not extend to Taxes imposed for which the Holder of the Securities would not have been eligible to receive payment of Additional
Amounts hereunder by virtue of clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 3.9(b) hereof, or to the extent such Holder received Additional
Amounts with respect to such payments.

(f) In addition, Guarantor will pay any stamp, issue, registration, court, documentary, excise or other similar taxes, charges and duties,
including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time in respect of the execution,
issuance, registration or delivery of this Canadian Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder and any
such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at any time as a result of, or in connection with, (i) any
payments made pursuant to the Securities, any Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder and/or (ii) the
enforcement of this Canadian Note Guarantee or any other such document or instrument referred to thereunder.

(g) The obligations described under this Section 3.9 will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and will apply
mutatis mutandis to any successor Person to Guarantor and to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia) in which such successor is organized, doing business or is otherwise resident for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction
(other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) from or through which payment is made by such successor or
its respective agents.

(h) Whenever this Canadian Note Guarantee refers to, in any context, the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount
payable under or with respect to any Security or under this Canadian Note Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional
Amounts or other payments that would be payable pursuant to this Section 3.9, if applicable.
