### MPT OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P.
 MPT FINANCE CORPORATION

#### €         % Senior Notes due 20
 Unconditionally Guaranteed by
 Medical Properties Trust, Inc.

MPT Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and MPT Finance Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Finco” and,
together with the Operating Partnership, the “Issuers”), are offering, as co-issuers, €         aggregate principal amount of   % senior notes due 20   (the “Notes”).
The Notes will mature on          , 20  . The Issuers will pay interest on the Notes annually in arrears on        of each year. Interest will accrue on the Notes
from          , 2021 and the first interest payment date will be          , 2022.

The Issuers may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time-to-time at their option. The redemption prices are described under the heading “Description of
Notes—Optional Redemption”. In addition, the Issuers may redeem the Notes in whole but not in part in the event of certain developments affecting taxation as
described under the heading “Description of Notes—Redemption for Changes in Taxes”. The Issuers must offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the purchase date, upon a change of control under certain circumstances.

The Notes will be the Issuers’ senior unsecured obligations and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Guarantee”) by the Issuers’ parent company, Medical
Properties Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“Medical Properties” and, as guarantor of the Notes, the “Guarantor”). The Notes and the Guarantee will rank equally in
right of payment with all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantor’s existing and future senior indebtedness and will rank senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness
that is subordinated to the Notes and the Guarantee. The Notes and the Guarantee will be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantor’s secured
indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes and the Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and
other liabilities of any of the Issuers’ subsidiaries and the Guarantor’s subsidiaries (other than the Issuers).

_Investing in the Notes involves risks. See the risk factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-18 of this prospectus supplement, as_
_well as the information under the heading “Risk Factors” included in the combined Annual Report on Form 10-K of Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and MPT_

We intend to apply to have the Notes admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange plc, branding as Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Dublin”), and traded on its

**PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights selected information contained elsewhere in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus or the_
_documents incorporated by reference herein and therein. This summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you or that_
_you should consider before making an investment decision. You should read carefully this entire prospectus supplement, the accompanying_

**Our Company**

MPT is a self-advised REIT listed on the New York Stock Exchange focused on investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities
across the United States, Europe, Australia and Colombia in South America, and selectively in other foreign jurisdictions. We acquire and develop
healthcare facilities and lease the facilities to healthcare operating companies under long-term net leases, which require the tenant to bear most of
the costs associated with the property. We also may make mortgage loans to healthcare operators collateralized by their real estate assets. In
addition, we selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, the proceeds of which are typically used for
acquisition and working capital. From time-to-time, we acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in these
tenants’ profits and losses. Our business model facilitates acquisitions and recapitalizations, and allows operators of healthcare facilities to unlock
the value of their real estate assets to fund facility improvements, technology upgrades, and other investments in operations.

At June 30, 2021, our portfolio (including assets held in joint ventures) consisted of 419 properties leased or loaned to 51 operators, of which
two were under development and five were in the form of mortgage loans. At June 30, 2021, our largest investment in a single property was less
than 4% of our total assets. At June 30, 2021, our properties were located in the United States, Europe, Australia and Colombia in South America,
and consisted of the following:

    - 199 general acute care hospitals;

    - 112 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals;

    - 20 long-term acute care hospitals;

    - 48 freestanding emergency room/urgent care facilities; and

    - 40 behavioral health facilities.

Of our portfolio of properties, 99 facilities are owned by way of our five unconsolidated real estate joint venture arrangements in which we
share control with our joint venture partners.

We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. MPT has operated as a REIT
since April 2004, and elected REIT status upon the filing of its federal income tax return for the taxable year ended on December 31, 2004. As of
June 30, 2021, MPT had a 100% equity ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Urban Center Drive, Suite 501, Birmingham, Alabama 35242. Our telephone number is

**Recent Developments**

**COVID-19 Pandemic**

The global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, including in countries where we own and lease facilities, has further validated our business
model, which focuses on hospitals as the centerpiece of healthcare delivery across the world. As the COVID-19 pandemic ramped up, governments
around the world looked to hospitals and hospital operators to provide necessary care to victims. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic,
our tenants were impacted by governmental mandates to defer elective surgeries, the takeover of certain facilities by governments and the overall
downturn in the economy. By the third quarter of 2020, our tenants were again accepting patients and performing medically necessary elective
procedures, resulting in improved volumes compared to the second quarter of 2020. In the first six months of 2021, we collected $1.6 million of
rent previously deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pursuant to agreements with certain tenants, we expect the remaining outstanding
deferred rent balance of approximately $9.8 million as of June 30, 2021 to be paid over specified periods in the future, with interest. As the
economy continues to recover from the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines continue to roll out, we expect to receive
substantially all rent and interest payments in the future. However, no assurances can be made that, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an
extended period of time, our rent and interest payments will not be delayed into the future until our tenants can recover.

In addition to the collection of almost all of our rent and interest during the COVID-19 pandemic, we, along with our operators, executed on
several accretive growth initiatives despite the volatile and challenging economic environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 and
year-to-date in 2021, we invested approximately $7 billion in hospital real estate. Additionally, we have maintained strong liquidity during the
COVID-19 pandemic by raising approximately $1.5 billion in proceeds through sales of our common stock, receiving more than $600 million from
payoffs on our loan portfolio and divestitures, and completing (i) a $1.3 billion, 3.500% senior unsecured notes offering, of which approximately
$833 million was used to refinance higher interest-rate debt, and (ii) a £850 million senior unsecured notes offering, the proceeds of which were
used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facilities.

**_Steward-HCA Transaction_**

On September 15, 2021, we entered into an agreement to lease five general acute care hospitals located in Utah to HCA Healthcare, Inc.
(“HCA”) following an agreement by HCA to purchase the operations of these five facilities from Steward Health Care System LLC (“Steward”).
Upon completion of the transaction between HCA and Steward, we will enter into a new master lease with HCA for these five facilities with a
15-year initial term, five extension options of five years each, and annual inflation-based escalators (the “HCA Transaction”). HCA will have
certain options to purchase the facilities starting in 2028, while we will have certain options to sell the facilities to HCA. The purchase price under
either option scenario will not be less than fair value.

The consummation of the HCA Transaction is expected in the first half of 2022 and is subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals
and other customary closing conditions. We cannot give assurances that the HCA Transaction will be successfully consummated as described
above or at all.

**_Macquarie Partnership_**

On September 1, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement with Macquarie Asset Management (“Macquarie”) to form a partnership (the
“Macquarie Transaction”), pursuant to which a fund managed by Macquarie will acquire a 50% interest in a portfolio of eight Massachusetts-based
general acute care hospitals operated by Steward for cash. The transaction values the portfolio at approximately $1.78 billion. We expect to
recognize a gain on real estate of approximately $0.7 billion as a result of the Macquarie Transaction based on a 5.6% cash capitalization rate
valuation of 2021 rents.

The triple net master lease between us and Steward was recently extended by 10 years to 2041. The partnership plans to raise nonrecourse
secured debt of up to 55% of asset value. We expect to receive total proceeds, including proceeds from the expected secured debt, of approximately
$1.3 billion. We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from the Macquarie Transaction to repay debt and partially fund the Springstone
Transaction (as defined below).

The consummation of the Macquarie Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, as well as the partnership’s ability to source
nonrecourse secured debt financing. We cannot give assurances that the Macquarie Transaction will be successfully consummated as described
above or at all.

**_Acquisition of Springstone Portfolio_**

On June 14, 2021, we entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership will acquire 18 inpatient
behavioral health hospital facilities and an interest in the operations of Springstone, LLC (“Springstone”) from Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $950 million (the “Springstone Transaction”).

The hospitals, along with additional facilities that Springstone expects to develop and acquire, are expected to be master leased pursuant to
terms that are anticipated to provide a GAAP-basis yield exceeding 9.0% and lease payment coverage of approximately 1.75x in the near-term. The
lease is expected to include an initial 20-year term with annual rent escalators based on the consumer price index, subject to a 2% floor. We expect
to initially fund the total cash consideration using cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion (the “Revolving Credit
Facility”) of our U.S. Credit Agreement (as defined below) and additional financing arrangements, which may include issuances of debt and equity
securities, placement of new secured loans on the acquired real estate, or a combination thereof. The sources of financing actually used will depend
upon a variety of factors, including market conditions.

The Springstone Transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including certain
regulatory approvals. There can be no guarantee that the Springstone Transaction will close on the terms and timeline disclosed above or at all.

**_Pending Disposition_**

On April 23, 2021, we agreed to sell Capital Medical Center in Olympia, Washington to the current operator for approximately $135 million.
The disposition is subject to customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals.

This offering is not conditioned upon the successful closing of the HCA Transaction, the Macquarie Transaction, the Springstone Transaction,
and the pending disposition, together the “Pending Transactions”, in whole or in part.

**Recently Completed Transactions**

**_Investment Activity_**

In June 2021, we acquired 35 behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom from the Priory Group for an aggregate purchase
price of approximately £800 million (approximately $1.1 billion) (the “Priory Group Transaction”). The properties are subject to a master lease
structure with an initial term of 25 years and two 10-year extension options, with annual rent escalators based on the U.K. consumer price index,
subject to a 2% floor. In addition to the real estate investment, on January 19, 2021, we made a 364-day, £250 million acquisition loan to Waterland
Private Equity Fund VII C.V. (“Waterland VII”), in connection with the closing of Waterland VII’s acquisition of the Priory Group. We expect this
loan to be repaid in the second half of 2021.

In July 2021, we acquired an acute care hospital in Stirling, Scotland for £15.6 million. The hospital is leased to Circle Health Ltd. (“Circle”)
pursuant to a long-term lease with annual inflation-based escalators. In the same month, we also acquired four acute care hospitals
and two on-campus medical office buildings in Los Angeles, California for $215 million (the “Pipeline Transaction”). These hospitals are leased to
Pipeline Health Systems pursuant to a long-term lease with annual inflation-based escalators.

On August 1, 2021, we acquired five general acute care hospitals from Tenet Healthcare (the “Tenet Transaction”), in conjunction with
Steward’s acquisition of the operations of the facilities, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $900 million, plus closing and other
transaction costs. The hospitals are leased pursuant to our master lease agreement with Steward, which exercised its options to extend the lease
term to 2041, leaving a five-year extension option remaining. We funded the total cash consideration using cash on hand and $650 million of
borrowings from a $1 billion interim credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC as administrative agent and several lenders from time to time party
thereto (the “July Interim Credit Facility”).

**_Development and Other Activity_**

We currently have two separate development projects ongoing with an aggregate committed budget of approximately $96 million,
$40 million of which remains to be funded as of the date of this prospectus supplement. The construction of these two facilities is expected to be
completed during 2021 and 2022. Additionally, we have remaining commitments to fund approximately $185 million in capital expenditures and
other projects as of the date of this prospectus supplement.

We collectively refer to all of the investing transactions described above under “—Investment Activity” and “—Development and Other
Activity”, including our remaining commitments to fund approximately $225 million in ongoing development, capital expenditures and other
projects, as the “Recent Investments”.

**_Dispositions_**

Subsequent to June 30, 2021, we sold four facilities for proceeds of $42 million, resulting in a net gain on real estate of approximately
$9.5 million (the “Dispositions”).

**_Loan and Other Repayments_**

Subsequent to June 30, 2021, we received approximately $24.8 million in loan principal and other repayments from our U.S. operators (the
“Loan and Other Repayments”).

**Financing Transactions**

**_At-the-Market Program Sales_**

From June 30, 2021 through September 21, 2021, we sold approximately 7 million shares of MPT common stock under an at-the-market
equity offering program, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $140.5 million.

**_U.S. Credit Agreement_**

At June 30, 2021, we had $213 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. After completion of the transactions described above
under “—Recently Completed Transactions” and “—Financing Transactions”, we expect the outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility
to be approximately $252 million, leaving approximately $1.05 billion available for borrowing. Additionally, the credit agreement that governs our
Revolving Credit Facility (the “U.S. Credit Agreement”) has a $200 million term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”), which is currently fully
drawn. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is February 1, 2024 and the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is February 1, 2026.
We have an option to extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility for six months, which option may be exercised up to two times. We
may prepay loans under the U.S. Credit Agreement at any time, subject to certain notice requirements.

We collectively refer to all of the financing transactions described above under “—Financing Transactions” as the “Financing Transactions”.
We collectively refer to the Recent Investments, the Pending Transactions, the Dispositions, the Loan and Other Repayments and the Financing
Transactions as the “Transactions”.

**Benefits of the Transactions**

We believe that the Transactions continue to expand our business model and enhance the size, diversity and quality of our healthcare portfolio
by:

    - **_Executing Our Investment Strategy. With the completion of the Transactions, our Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets as of_**

June 30, 2021 increased to approximately $22.3 billion. Additionally, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to identify
additional hospital acquisition opportunities in the United States, Europe, Australia and South America.

    - **_Reducing Concentration. Upon completion of the Transactions, the largest facility in our portfolio will account for less than 3% of our_**

Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets as of June 30, 2021. In addition, our exposure to Steward, our largest tenant, will be reduced to
approximately 17% of our Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets as of June 30, 2021 from 24% as of June 30, 2020, and the
combined concentration of Steward and Circle, our two largest tenants, will be reduced to approximately 29% of our Transaction
Adjusted Total Gross Assets as of June 30, 2021 from 37% as of June 30, 2020.

    - **_Establishing New Operator Relationships and Growing Existing Relationships. The Transactions added five new tenants to our_**

portfolio of operators and grew several existing relationships, increasing the total number of operators to 52. We believe that these new
and continuing relationships strengthen our overall portfolio and could potentially lead to future growth.

    - **_Achieving Greater Scale. As of June 30, 2021, our Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets have increased approximately 29% from_**

$17.3 billion as of June 30, 2020. In 2020 and 2021, and adjusted for the Transactions, we added approximately 50 hospital facilities
and approximately 5,000 beds to our portfolio, increasing the total number of facilities to 444 and approximately 46,000 beds.


S-5


-----

    - **_Extending our Lease and Loan Maturity Schedule. As of June 30, 2021, adjusted for the Transactions, our overall weighted-average_**

lease and loan expiration was 17.7 years, and approximately 88.9% of the total annualized rent/interest of our portfolio had lease and
loan expirations beyond 2030, with average annual lease and loan maturities of approximately 1.1% per annum through 2030.

    - **_Reducing Mortgage Loan Investments. Upon completion of the Transactions, our total mortgage loan investment exposure was_**

reduced to less than 1% of our Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets as of June 30, 2021 from 7.8% as of June 30, 2020.

    - **_Furthering Our Pipeline. We continually evaluate healthcare property acquisition and development opportunities as they arise. At any_**

given point, we typically have a number of potential acquisition and development transactions under active consideration, which are in
varying stages of negotiation and due diligence review. Except as otherwise disclosed in this prospectus supplement, we are not party to
any material binding agreements in respect of any such transactions, and we cannot assure you that we will successfully enter into any
such binding agreements or that, if we do, we will be able to successfully close on such transactions. We expect to initially fund the
contractual purchase price for any potential transactions with cash on-hand, borrowings under our debt facilities, net proceeds from
issuances of debt or equity securities, proceeds from strategic property sales or joint ventures, or a combination thereof.

The following charts show our Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets composition at June 30, 2021. See “Summary Historical
Consolidated Financial Data” in this prospectus supplement for a definition of Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets and reconciliation to total
assets.

as defined in “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions”, and together, our “Senior Credit
Facilities”) and our existing debt securities and will rank senior in right of payment to all of
such entities’ future subordinated indebtedness; however, the Notes and the Guarantee will
be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuers’ and Medical Properties’ secured
indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The

and Medical Properties would have had approximately $        billion of indebtedness

of which will guarantee the Notes on the date of issuance, would have had no indebtedness,
other than MPT Australia Realty Trust’s borrowings under the Australian Credit
Agreement, certain of our subsidiaries’ borrowings under the U.K. Credit Agreement and
certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership’s borrowings under the U.K. Credit
Agreement, all of which indebtedness is included in the Issuers’ and MPT’s indebtedness.


S-9


-----

In addition, as of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions described in the
“Prospectus Supplement Summary—Recent Developments” section, the issuance of the
Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds”,
we would have had approximately $        million of borrowings outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility and $        billion of availability.

**Certain Covenants** The indenture governing the Notes will restrict the Issuers’ ability and the ability of their
restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

                                         - incur debt;

                                         - pay dividends and make distributions;

                                         - create liens;

                                         - enter into transactions with affiliates; and

                                         - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.

The indenture governing the Notes will also require the Issuers and their restricted
subsidiaries to maintain total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of our collective
unsecured debt.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants”. In addition, the indenture governing the Notes will provide
that if the Notes have Investment Grade Status from at least two of three Rating Agencies
(as such terms are defined in the “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions”), several
material covenants included in the indenture will be suspended or become more lenient, as
the case may be, if the Issuers provide notice of such ratings to the trustee, until such time
as such Notes no longer have Investment Grade Status from at least two of three Rating
Agencies. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants”.

**Additional Amounts** Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Issuers will pay such Additional Amounts
(as defined in “Description of Notes—Additional Amounts”) on the Notes (or payments
under the Guarantee in respect thereof) as may be necessary so that the net amount
received by each holder of the Notes after all withholding or deductions, if any, will equal
the respective amount the holder would have received in respect of such Note (or payments
under the Guarantee in respect thereof) in the absence of such withholding or deduction.
See “Description of Notes—Additional Amounts”.

**Listing** We intend to apply to have the Notes admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and
traded on its Global Exchange Market. No certainty can be given that this application will
be granted.


S-10


-----

**No Public Market** The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no established trading market.
The underwriters have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes. The
underwriters are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any such
market-making may be discontinued by the underwriters in their discretion at any time
without notice. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity
of any market for the Notes. See “Underwriting”.

**Currency of Payment** All payments of interest and principal, including payments made upon any redemption of
the notes, will be made in euros. If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of
exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer
being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted
the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or
within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the notes will
be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. See “Risk Factors
—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering” and “Description of Notes—Issuance in
Euros” in this prospectus supplement.

**Form and Denomination** The Notes will be ready for delivery to investors in book-entry form through the facilities
of Clearstream and Euroclear on or about          , 2021. The Notes will be issued in
the form of one or more fully registered global securities in denominations of €100,000 in
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Beneficial interests in
the global certificates representing the Notes will be shown on, and transfers will be
effected only through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their direct
and indirect participants and such interests may not be exchanged for certificated Notes,
except in limited circumstances.

The Notes have been accepted for clearance through Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg with the following ISINs and Common Codes:

                                         - ISIN: XS2390849318

                                         - Common Code: 239084931

**Use of Proceeds** We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
€        ($         ), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our
estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund
the redemption of all of the outstanding 4.000% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the
“2022 Notes”), and any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may
include repaying amounts outstanding from time-to-time under the Revolving Credit
Facility, working capital, capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions. See “Use of
Proceeds”.

The summary historical consolidated financial data presented below as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 has been derived from the Operating Partnership’s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes appearing in the 2020 10-K, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The
summary historical consolidated financial data as of June 30, 2021 and for the six and three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 has been derived
from the Operating Partnership’s unaudited quarterly financial data. This unaudited consolidated financial data has been prepared on a basis
consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial data reflects all
adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for those periods. The results of
operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Historical results are also not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected in the future.

As of June 30, 2021, MPT had a 100% equity ownership interest in the Operating Partnership. MPT has no significant operations other than
as the sole member of its wholly owned subsidiary, Medical Properties Trust, LLC, which is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership,
and no material assets, other than its direct and indirect investment in the Operating Partnership. There is no significant difference between the
Operating Partnership’s net income and MPT’s net income.

You should read the following summary of historical consolidated financial data in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Operating Partnership’s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes included in the 2020 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, which are incorporated by reference

(1) We believe that the Operating Partnership’s earnings before interest expense (including unutilized financing fees/debt refinancing costs),
income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), including similar items from our unconsolidated joint ventures, and Adjusted
EBITDA, are useful supplemental measures of

our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the impact of gains and losses on asset sales, write-offs of
straight line rent, impairment charges, acquisition costs, non-cash stock compensation expense and non-cash fair value adjustments. We
believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of
the operating performance of REITs and REITs’ ability to service debt. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before
recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes, exclude capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not
adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utility as measures of the Operating Partnership’s
performance is limited. In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur charges, costs
and expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Accordingly,
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as a
measure of the Operating Partnership’s financial performance. Other REITs may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and related
measures and statistics differently than the Operating Partnership does; accordingly, the Operating Partnership’s EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA may not be comparable to the corresponding metrics used by other REITs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as described above are
not calculated on the same basis as “Consolidated EBITDA” will be calculated under the indenture governing the Notes. For a description of
how “Consolidated EBITDA” will be calculated under the indenture governing the Notes, see “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions.”
(2) We believe that Transaction Adjusted EBITDA and LQA Transaction Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of our operating
performance because they allow investors to view our performance for specified periods reflective of the Transactions as if they had occurred
on April 1, 2021. Transaction Adjusted EBITDA consists of the Operating Partnership’s Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended
June 30, 2021, plus rent and interest we estimate we would have received from (x) the assets we have invested in the Transactions had we
invested in such assets on April 1, 2021 for the period beginning on April 1, 2021 and ending on the earlier of June 30, 2021 or the date of
each such investment and (y) the leases we expect to enter into with tenants upon completion of the development activities (described in “—
Recent Developments—Development Activities”) had such leases began on April 1, 2021, less (z) rent attributable to the assets we have
divested since April 1, 2021 and pending disposals included in the Transactions, such as the Macquarie Transaction, to the extent such rent
was included in the Operating Partnership’s total net income for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and the interest attributable to the
approximately $24.8 million we received as a result of the Loan and Other Repayments on or after April 1, 2021 (collectively, “Estimated net
gain from the Transactions”). For a description of the Transactions, see “—Recent Developments”. LQA Transaction Adjusted EBITDA is
the Operating Partnership’s Transaction Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2021, annualized. Transaction Adjusted
EBITDA was prepared based upon the purchase method of accounting for the real estate acquired in the Transactions as if they had occurred
on April 1, 2021, and the expected accounting treatment of the related leases pursuant to GAAP. Because Transaction Adjusted EBITDA and
LQA Transaction Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes, exclude
capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our
business, including assets acquired in the Transactions, as if they had occurred on April 1, 2021, their utility as measures of the Operating
Partnership’s performance is limited. In evaluating Transaction Adjusted EBITDA and LQA Transaction Adjusted EBITDA, investors should
be aware that in the future we may incur charges, costs and expenses that are the same as or similar to some adjustments in this presentation.
Our presentation of Transaction Adjusted EBITDA and LQA Transaction Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our
future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Accordingly, Transaction Adjusted EBITDA and LQA Transaction
Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as measures

of the Operating Partnership’s financial performance. Transaction Adjusted EBITDA and LQA Transaction Adjusted EBIDTA as described
above are not calculated on the same basis as the one that “Consolidated EBITDA” will be calculated under the indenture governing the
Notes. For a description of how “Consolidated EBITDA” will be calculated under the indenture governing the Notes, see “Description of
Notes—Certain Definitions”.
(3) Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets is the Operating Partnership’s total assets as of June 30, 2021, before accumulated
depreciation/amortization (adjusted for our unconsolidated joint ventures and certain lease intangible assets), and assumes that the
Transactions not completed at June 30, 2021 discussed in “—Recent Developments” are fully funded, and that cash on hand is used in these
transactions. We believe Transaction Adjusted Total Gross Assets is useful to investors as it provides a more current view of our portfolio and
allows for a better understanding of our concentration levels as our binding commitments close and our other commitments are fully funded.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves various risks, including those set forth below as well as the risk factors included in the 2020 10-K and in our_
_subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying_
_prospectus. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus_
_supplement and the accompanying prospectus, before making an investment in the Notes. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not_
_presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations. These risks could materially adversely_
_affect, among other things, our business, financial condition or results of operations, and could cause the trading price of the Notes to decline, resulting_
_in the loss of all or part of your investment._

**_Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and may otherwise adversely impact our business operations. We and our_**
**_subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness._**

As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, the issuance of the Notes offered hereby and the application of the proceeds from this
offering as described in “Use of Proceeds”, MPT and the Issuers would have had (i) $        billion of indebtedness outstanding (none of which
would have been secured indebtedness), (ii) $        million of borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and
(iii) $        billion of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our indebtedness could have significant effects on our business and the
holders of the Notes. For example, it could:

    - require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the available cash

flow to fund working capital, development projects and other general corporate purposes and reduce cash for distributions;

    - require payments of principal and interest that may be greater than our cash flow from operations;

    - force us to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our debt;

    - increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

    - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

    - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities;

    - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; and

    - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

In addition, as of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, the issuance of the Notes offered hereby and the application of the
proceeds from this offering as described in “Use of Proceeds”, we would have had approximately $        million of borrowings outstanding under
our Senior Credit Facilities that bore interest at variable rates. If interest rates increase significantly, our ability to borrow additional funds may be
reduced and the risk related to our indebtedness would intensify.

In addition, most of our current debt is, and we anticipate that much of our future debt will be, non-amortizing and payable in balloon payments.
Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of that debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance debt maturing
in future years or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the then-existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity
cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital or sales of facilities, our cash flow may not be
sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. Additionally, we may incur significant penalties if we choose
to prepay the debt. In addition to our debt service obligations, our operations may require substantial investments on a continuing basis.

S-18


-----

Our ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non-capital
expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties (to the extent not paid by our tenants), as well as to provide
capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions
and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.

Subject to the restrictions that are contained in many of our debt instruments, including our Senior Credit Facilities and the indentures governing
the Existing Notes and that will be contained in the indenture governing the Notes, we may incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured
debt. Although the terms of these agreements contain or will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are or will be
subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. In
addition, certain restrictions in the indentures governing the Existing Notes on our ability to incur indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, would
be relaxed to the extent such securities are upgraded one notch to a rating of “Baa3” or higher from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s) at a
time when such securities are rated “BBB-” or higher from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”). In addition, certain restrictions in the indenture
governing the Notes on our ability to incur indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, to the extent the Notes have Investment Grade Status from at
least two of three Rating Agencies. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants”. If we incur additional debt in the
future, the risks described above could increase.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to_**
**_satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful._**

Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:

    - our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory

and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and

    - our future ability to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, the availability of which depends on, among other things, our complying

with the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to draw under the Revolving
Credit Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell
assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and
may not be effected on sufficiently favorable terms to permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance
our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of
existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we
could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity, and/or negotiate with our lenders
to restructure the applicable debt, in order to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair
market value or at all. Our Senior Credit Facilities, the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the Notes, may
restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to avail ourselves to some or all of these options. Furthermore, any proceeds that we
could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.

**_Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business._**

The Senior Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Existing Notes contain and the indenture that will govern the Notes will contain and
any instruments governing future indebtedness of ours may contain, a

S-19


-----

number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:

    - incur additional debt;

    - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of MPT’s capital stock or make other restricted payments;

    - make certain payments on debt that is subordinated to the Notes;

    - make certain investments;

    - sell or transfer assets;

    - create liens on certain assets;

    - consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

    - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and

    - designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

Any of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities. Any
failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under our Senior Credit Facilities, the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the
indenture that will govern the Notes. Upon a default, unless waived, the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities could elect to terminate their
commitments, cease making further loans and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. Holders of the Notes or our Existing Notes would also have the
ability to ultimately force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a default (or an event of default) under our Senior Credit Facilities, the
indenture governing the Notes or any of the indentures governing our Existing Notes may trigger a cross-default under our other agreements and could
trigger a cross-default or cross-acceleration under the agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our operating results may not be sufficient to
service our indebtedness or to fund our other expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing to meet these requirements. See “Description of
Notes”.

**_Many of the restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the Notes will cease to_**
**_apply if the Notes achieve an investment grade rating from at least two of three Rating Agencies._**

In November 2014, S&P upgraded the rating on our Existing Notes that were outstanding at such time from BB to BBB-. As a result and pursuant
to the terms of the credit agreement that governed our then existing U.S. revolving credit facility and term loan facility, our subsidiaries were released
from their guarantee obligations thereunder and pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the Existing Notes that were outstanding at such time,
our subsidiaries were released from their guarantee obligations under the indentures governing the Existing Notes that were outstanding at such time as
well. The U.S. Credit Agreement is not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and none of our Existing Notes that were issued after such date are
guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries on the date of issuance.
In addition, if Moody’s were to similarly upgrade the credit rating on our Existing Notes to an investment grade rating (assuming the Existing Notes
continue to be rated BBB- or higher by S&P), the indentures governing the Existing Notes provide that significant restrictive covenants will be
suspended and cease to be applicable during any period that such notes are rated investment grade by both S&P and Moody’s (or with respect to certain
series of the Existing Notes, during any period that such notes obtain investment grade status from at least two of three rating agencies) and until such
time that such notes are no longer rated investment grade by both such rating agencies (or with respect to certain series of the notes, two out of three
rating agencies). These covenants include limitations on restricted payments, including restricted investments, limitations on dividend and other
payments, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on asset sales and certain covenants applicable to consolidations, mergers and sales of
assets. In addition, the covenant

S-20


-----

restricting our ability to incur more indebtedness would become materially more lenient. If these restrictive covenants cease to apply or become more
lenient, as the case may be, we may take actions, such as incurring additional debt and increasing dividends paid, that would otherwise be prohibited
under the indentures governing the Existing Notes without the prior consent of holders of the Existing Notes. If the Notes have Investment Grade Status
from at least two of three Rating Agencies, the analogous covenants contained in the indenture that will govern the Notes, as well as our obligation to
make an offer to purchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, would also be suspended and cease to be applicable until such time
that such Notes no longer have Investment Grade Status from by at least two of three Rating Agencies. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants
—Suspension of Covenants”.

**_The Notes, on the date of issuance, will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and we will depend on dividends and distributions from our_**
**_direct and indirect subsidiaries to fulfill our obligations under the Notes. The creditors of these subsidiaries are entitled to amounts payable to them_**
**_by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us._**

Substantially all of our assets are held through our subsidiaries. We depend on these subsidiaries for substantially all of our cash flow. The
creditors of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are entitled to payment of that subsidiary’s obligations to them, when due and payable, before
distributions may be made by that subsidiary to us. Thus, our ability to service our debt obligations, including our ability to pay the interest on and
principal of the Notes when due, depends on our subsidiaries’ ability first to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and then to make distributions to
us. Our subsidiaries are not guarantors of the Notes and are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligations to make any funds available to us.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes._**

Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under our Senior Credit Facilities and the indentures governing
the Existing Notes and the indenture that will govern the Notes, that is not waived by the required holders of such indebtedness, could leave us unable to
pay principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes and could substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate
sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest on such
indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing
our indebtedness, including our Senior Credit Facilities, the indenture that will govern the Notes or any of the indentures governing the Existing Notes,
we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness
could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our
Senior Credit Facilities could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, as
applicable. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the required lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities
to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our Senior Credit Facilities and seek waivers, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the
required lenders thereunder.

**_An investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not the euro entails significant risks._**

An investment in securities which are denominated and payable in a currency other than the currency of the country in which the purchaser is a
resident or the currency in which the purchaser primarily conducts its business or activities (in each case, the “home currency”) entails significant risks
not associated with securities denominated and payable in the home currency. Accordingly, an investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home
currency is not the euro entails significant risks. These risks include the possibility of significant changes in rates of exchange between the holder’s
home currency and the euro and the possibility of the imposition or subsequent modification of foreign exchange controls. These risks generally depend
on factors over which we

S-21


-----

have no control, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies. In recent years, rates of
exchange between the euro and certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder should be aware that such volatility may occur in the
future. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations in the rate that
may occur during the term of the Notes. Depreciation of the euro against the holder’s home currency would result in a decrease in the effective yield of
the Notes below its coupon rate and, in certain circumstances, could result in a loss to the holder.

**_The United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union could increase volatility in the financial markets and currency exchange rates,_**
**_including the euro._**

The United Kingdom left the European Union (the “EU”) on January 31, 2020, subject to a transitional period which ended on December 31,
2020. On December 24, 2020, negotiators representing the United Kingdom and the EU came to a preliminary trade agreement, which was subsequently
ratified by the UK Parliament. The trade agreement must also be ratified by the European Parliament. The United Kingdom’s exit from the European
Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”, has created an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and European Union
countries. The political and economic instability created by Brexit could negatively impact the economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the
European Union and globally and could lead to an increase in the volatility in currency exchange rates, including the euro, as well as to volatility in the
financial markets and thus impact the liquidity and/or the market value of the Notes.

**_The Notes permit us to make payments in U.S. dollars if we are unable to obtain euros, which could adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer
used by the member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public
institutions within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again
available to us or so used. The amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the then most recently available
market exchange rate for euros. See “Description of Notes—Issuance in Euros.” Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not
constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes. If your home currency is not U.S. dollars, any such payment will expose you to
the significant risks described above under “—An investment in the Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not the euro entails significant risks.”
Such developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**_Trading in the clearing systems is subject to minimum denomination requirements._**

The Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. It is possible that the
clearing systems may process trades which could result in amounts being held in denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive
notes are required to be issued in relation to such Notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the
minimum denomination or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof in its account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not
receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive notes unless and until such time as its holding satisfies the minimum denomination requirement.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream to exercise any_**
**_rights and remedies._**

So long as Euroclear or Clearstream or their common depositary or nominee is the registered holder of the Notes issued in the form of one or more
global notes, Euroclear, Clearstream or such common depositary or nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the
Notes represented by the global

S-22


-----

notes for all purposes under the indenture and the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and premium and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the
global notes will be made to Euroclear, Clearstream, such common depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof. After
payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream and, if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which
they own (directly or indirectly) their interest, to receive such payments or to exercise any other rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the
applicable indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents,
requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, such investor will be permitted to act
only to the extent such investor has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting
of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under an indenture, unless and until definitive or certificated registered Notes are issued in
respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests in global notes representing Notes issued under such indenture, they will be
restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream, may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**_In a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, a noteholder may bear currency exchange risk._**

The Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, and a lawsuit for payment on the Notes may
be heard in a state or federal court in New York state. A New York state statute presently in effect but subject to amendment would require a New York
state court hearing such a lawsuit to render its decision or award in euros. The judgment entered on that award, however, will be denominated in dollars,
and converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the judgment’s entry. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, investors would
bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a long time. We believe that a Federal court sitting in New
York with diversity jurisdiction over a dispute arising in connection with the Notes would apply the foregoing New York law.

In courts outside of New York, noteholders may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment
for money in an action based on the Notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S.
dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euros into U.S. dollars would depend upon various factors, including which court renders
the judgment.

**_Potential foreign currency gain on the Notes may cause REIT qualification issues; repayment of the Notes may be accelerated to help ensure we_**
**_maintain our qualification as a REIT._**

Interest payments on the Notes and repayment of principal amount of the Notes may result in foreign currency exchange gain that is neither
excluded from, nor treated as qualifying income for purposes of, the 75% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and
maintain our status as a REIT. As a result, significant currency fluctuations could result in our failure to qualify as a REIT in the event we repay the
Notes at a time when the amount of foreign currency gain would, when combined with our other sources of nonqualifying income, exceed 25% of our
gross income. Furthermore, attempting to minimize the amount of foreign currency gain may require us to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at times
and for prices which would not otherwise be attractive to us. This could have an adverse impact on noteholders whose holding of Notes are not
redeemed in full.

**_Your right to receive payments on the Notes is effectively subordinated to the right of lenders who have a security interest in our assets to the extent_**
**_of the value of those assets._**

Our obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes are, and the Notes will be, unsecured, but certain of our future debt
obligations may be secured. If we are declared bankrupt or insolvent, or if we default under any of our future secured financing arrangements, the funds
borrowed thereunder, together with accrued interest, could become immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the
lenders could foreclose on the pledged assets to the exclusion of holders of the Notes, even if an event of default exists under the indenture governing
the Notes at such time. In any such event, because the Notes are not secured by any of such assets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient assets
from which your claims could be satisfied. After giving effect to the Transactions, none of MPT’s or the Issuers’ indebtedness is secured indebtedness,
but the indenture governing the Notes will permit such entities to incur secured indebtedness.

**_Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of our subsidiaries._**

We conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries, which are not guarantors under the Notes. The indenture governing the Notes will
permit us to form or acquire subsidiaries and to contribute assets to such subsidiaries and permit such subsidiaries to acquire assets and incur
indebtedness, and, as a result, holders of the Notes would not have any claim as a creditor against any such subsidiaries. The claims of the creditors of
our subsidiaries, including their trade creditors, banks and other lenders, would have priority over any of our claims. Consequently, in any insolvency,
liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of any of our subsidiaries, creditors of those subsidiaries would be paid before any amounts
would be distributed to us, and thus be available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and Guarantee of the Notes.

As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, our subsidiaries, none of which will guarantee the Notes on the date of issuance,
would have had no indebtedness other than MPT Australia Realty Trust’s borrowings under the Australian Credit Agreement, certain of our subsidiaries’
borrowings under the U.K. Credit Agreement, and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership’s borrowings under the U.K. Credit Agreement, all
of which indebtedness is included in the Issuers’ and MPT’s indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the Notes upon a Change of Control and Rating Decline._**

Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event”, as defined in the indenture that will govern the Notes, with certain exceptions
(including if the Notes have Investment Grade Status from at least two of three Rating Agencies), each holder of the Notes will have the right to require
us to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. Our failure to purchase, or to give notice of purchase of, the Notes
would be a default under the indenture that will govern the Notes and any such default could result in a default under certain of our other indebtedness,
including our Senior Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Existing Notes. Under the indentures governing the Existing Notes, each holder
of the Existing Notes has the right to require us to purchase their Existing Notes upon a change of control (with no Ratings Decline). As a result, upon a
Change of Control and without a Rating Decline, although we will not be required to purchase the Notes, we may be required to purchase the Existing
Notes. In addition, a change of control may constitute an event of default under our Senior Credit Facilities. Furthermore, if the Notes have Investment
Grade Status from at least two of three Rating Agencies, our obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event would be suspended and cease to be applicable until such time that such Notes are no longer rated investment grade by at least two of three Rating
Agencies. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants”.

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void guarantees and require holders of Notes to return payments received_**
**_from a guarantor._**

MPT will guarantee the obligations under the Notes. The issuance of the Guarantee may be subject to review under federal and state laws if a
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit, including in

S-24


-----

circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were commenced at some future date by, or on behalf of, the unpaid creditors of the guarantor.
Under the federal bankruptcy laws and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer, insolvency, fictitious indebtedness and similar laws, a court
may void or otherwise decline to enforce a guarantor’s guarantee or may subordinate the Notes or such guarantee to the guarantor’s existing and future
indebtedness, if, among other things, the guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee:

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in exchange for its issuance of the guarantee;

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was engaged in a business or transaction, or was about to engage in a business or transaction, for which its remaining assets constituted

unreasonably small capital; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured.

Under the fictitious indebtedness laws of some states, the presence of the above-listed factors is not required for a guarantee to be invalidated. A
court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in exchange for such guarantee if such
guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of such guarantee. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these
fraudulent transfer, insolvency and similar laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has
occurred. Generally, however, a guarantor, as applicable, would be considered insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts,

including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

A court might also void the guarantee, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the guarantor entered into its guarantee with the
actual or deemed intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors.

To the extent a court voids the guarantee as a fraudulent transfer or holds the guarantee unenforceable or voidable for any other reason, holders of
the Notes would no longer have a claim against such guarantor or the benefit of the assets of such guarantor constituting collateral that purportedly
secured such guarantee. In addition, the court might direct holders of the Notes to repay any amounts already received from a guarantor. If the court
were to void MPT’s guarantee, we cannot assure you that funds would be available to pay the Notes from any of our subsidiaries or from any other
source.

**_Finco has no material assets or operations and provides no credit support for the Notes._**

Finco is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership and was formed for the sole purpose of being a co-issuer of some of the
Operating Partnership’s indebtedness. It has no assets or operations. You should not rely upon Finco to make payments on the Notes.

**_There is no established trading market for the Notes and if an actual trading market does not develop, you may not be able to resell them quickly, for_**
**_the price that you paid or at all._**

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no existing market. Although we expect to apply to have the Notes admitted to the
Official List of the Euronext Dublin and for them to be admitted to trading on its

S-25


-----

Global Exchange Market within a reasonable period after the issuance thereof, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or will remain listed or
admitted to trading. We may not obtain or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Euronext Dublin and may seek to obtain and maintain the
listing of the Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Failure for the Notes to be admitted to
listing on, or the delisting of the Notes from, the Official List of the Euronext Dublin or another listing exchange may have a material adverse effect on a
holder’s ability to sell the Notes. In addition, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Notes, the ability of holders
of the Notes to sell them or the price at which the holders of the Notes may be able to sell them. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend
on the number of holders, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions and our
own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as recommendations by securities analysts. Historically, the market for debt securities, such
as the Notes, has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial price volatility. We cannot assure you that if a market for the Notes were to
develop, it would not be subject to similar disruptions.

Certain of the underwriters have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. Each underwriter
may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice. As a result, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity
of any trading market for the Notes. We also cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or at all, or that the prices that
you receive when you sell them will be favorable. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at their fair market
value, or at all.

**_The Notes may be subject to withholding taxes in circumstances where the Issuers are not obliged to make gross up payments and this would result_**
**_in holders receiving less interest than expected and could adversely affect their return on the Notes._**

The terms of the Notes contain exemptions from the requirement that the Issuers make gross up payments in the event an amount of, or in respect
of, taxes were to be withheld from a payment. Where such exemptions apply, neither the Issuers, nor any paying agent, nor any other person would be
obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Notes as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. This could result in holders receiving
less interest than expected and could adversely affect their after-tax return on the Notes.

**_The credit ratings assigned to the Notes may not reflect all risks of an investment in the Notes._**

The credit ratings assigned to the Notes reflect the rating agencies’ assessment of our ability to make payments on the Notes when due.
Consequently, real or anticipated changes in assigned credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the Notes. The credit ratings, however, may
not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to structure, market or other factors related to the value of the Notes.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the indenture that will govern the Notes by beneficial owners with short positions in excess of their_**
**_interests in the Notes will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of Notes agrees, in connection with any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the
trustee to provide a notice of default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to
the Issuers and the trustee that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment in the Notes (other than
screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case such holder is the depositary or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners
that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined in “Description of Notes—Certain Definitions”) and (ii) provide the Issuers with such
other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five
business days of request therefor. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable to make such a
representation.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately €        ($         ), after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and our estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the redemption of all of the outstanding
2022 Notes, and any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include repaying amounts outstanding from time-to-time under
the Revolving Credit Facility, working capital, capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions.

At September 21, 2021, we had €500 million of 2022 Notes outstanding. Interest on the 2022 Notes is payable annually on August 19 of each
year. The 2022 Notes mature on August 19, 2022.

The Revolving Credit Facility consists of $1.3 billion, approximately £0.2 billion of which was outstanding at September 21, 2021. The Revolving
Credit Facility matures February 1, 2024 and can be extended for an additional 12 months at our option. Commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility may be increased in an aggregate amount not to exceed $500 million. At our option, loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be made as
either ABR loans or Eurocurrency loans. The applicable margin for loans that are ABR loans is adjustable on a sliding scale from 0.00% to 0.55% based
on current credit rating. The applicable margin for loans that are Eurocurrency loans is adjustable on a sliding scale from 0.825% to 1.55% based on
current credit rating. At September 21, 2021, the applicable margin was 1.2%. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a facility fee that is adjustable
on a sliding scale from 0.125% to 0.3% based on current credit rating.

Pending such use of the net proceeds from this offering, the Operating Partnership intends to invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing
securities.

Certain of the underwriters or their affiliates may hold 2022 Notes and may receive proceeds from this offering through the redemption of the
2022 Notes. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent we use a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, such affiliates will receive their proportionate share of any
amounts repaid.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

We will issue the senior unsecured notes due 20         (the “Notes”) under the base indenture, dated as of October 10, 2013, by and among
MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. (“Opco”), MPT Finance Corporation (“Finco”), Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (the “Parent”), the subsidiaries party
thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “trustee”), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, by and among Opco,
Finco, Parent and the trustee (as amended and supplemented, the “indenture”). The following is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture. It
does not restate that agreement, and we urge you to read the indenture in its entirety, which is available upon request to Opco at the address indicated
under “Where You Can Find More Information” in the accompanying prospectus, because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of
the Notes.

You can find the definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this description under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” The terms
_“Issuers”, “we”, “us” and “our” as used in this section refer only to Opco and Finco and not to any of their subsidiaries and the term “Parent” as used_
in this section refers only to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and not to any of its subsidiaries.

**General**

The Issuers will issue € aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes will be unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers and will mature
on        , 20        . The Notes will initially bear interest at a rate of  % per annum, payable annually in arrears to holders of record at the close
of business on the business day immediately preceding the interest payment date on        of each year, commencing        , 2022.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable, and the Notes may be exchanged or transferred, in accordance with the
terms of the indenture.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of
days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the
Notes (or the Issue Date if no interest has been paid on the Notes), to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention
is referred to as ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.

The Notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in minimum denominations of €100,000 of principal amount and any
integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Issuers are
entitled to require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge payable in connection with a registration of
transfer. Subject to the covenants described below under “—Certain Covenants” and applicable law, the Issuers are entitled to issue additional notes
under the indenture. The Notes and any additional notes of the same series as the Notes subsequently issued under the indenture will be treated as a
single class for all purposes under the indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Additional notes will not
necessarily be fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). The terms of the Notes include
those stated in the indenture and those made part of the indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act.

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent and Registrar**

The Issuers will make all payments, including principal of, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes, at their offices or
through an agent that they will maintain for these purposes. Initially, that

S-30


-----

office will be the office of the principal paying agent (the “paying agent”). Elavon Financial Services DAC, with offices in Ireland, will act as the
principal paying agent. The Issuers may change the paying agent and/or the location of the paying agent with respect to the Notes without prior notice to
the holders. The Issuers will make all payments on the Notes in same day funds. Payments on the Global Notes will be made to the common depositary
for Euroclear and Clearstream as the registered holder of the “global notes” (as defined under “—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”).

The Issuers will also maintain a registrar (the “registrar”) for the Notes and the initial registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC, with
offices in Ireland. The Issuers will also maintain a transfer agent (the “transfer agent”) for the Notes and the initial transfer agent will be Elavon
Financial Services DAC, with offices in Ireland.

The Issuers may change the paying agent, the registrar or the transfer agent without prior notice to the holders of the Notes. For so long as the
Notes are admitted to the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Dublin”), and for trading on its Global
Exchange Market and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuers will deliver a notice of any change of paying agent, registrar or transfer agent to
Euronext Dublin through its online portal, Euronext Direct.

No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer, exchange or redemption of the Notes, but the Issuers may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

**Issuance in Euros**

Initial holders will be required to pay for the Notes in euros, and principal, premium, if any, and interest payments in respect of the Notes,
including any payments made upon any redemption of the Notes, will be payable in euros.

If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or the euro is no longer used
by the member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public
institutions within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again
available to us or so used. The amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not
mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the
relevant payment date, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an
event of default under the Indenture. Neither the trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be responsible for obtaining exchange rates, effecting conversions or
otherwise handling redenominations.

Investors will be subject to foreign exchange risks as to payments of principal and interest that may have important economic and tax
consequences to them. See “Risk Factors.”

**Transfer**

All transfers of book-entry interests in the Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream
pursuant to customary procedures and subject to applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective
participants. For the purposes of Clearstream the Issuer will be recorded as MPT Operating Partnership, L.P. Please see the section entitled “—BookEntry, Delivery and Form.”

S-31


-----

Notes issued as definitive registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, to persons who take delivery thereof in the form of definitive registered Notes. In
connection with any such transfer or exchange, the indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder of the Notes to, among other things,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where
appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will
be made without charge to the holder of the Notes, other than any taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

**Optional Redemption**

The Issuers will be entitled at their option to redeem all or any portion of the Notes at any time or from time to time        prior to days prior to
the maturity date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

    - 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed; or

    - the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related

redemption date, but for such redemption, and calculated as if such Notes being redeemed matured on (        days prior to maturity) (the
“Par Call Date”) (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the redemption date) discounted to the redemption
date on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) using a discount rate equal to the Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined
below) plus        basis points (such excess, if any, of (ii) over (i), the “Make-Whole Premium”),

plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts to, but not including, the applicable redemption date;
provided, however, that if the redemption date falls after a record date and on or prior to the corresponding interest payment date, the Issuers will pay the
full amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Amounts, if any, on such interest payment date to the holder of record at the close of
business on the corresponding record date (instead of the holder surrendering its Notes for redemption).

In addition, the Notes may be redeemed on or after the Par Call Date to the maturity date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any Additional Amounts to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date.

As used herein:

“Comparable Government Bond” means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent
investment bank selected by us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the Par Call Date, or if such independent investment bank in its
discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the
advice of three brokers of, and/or market makers in, German federal government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the
Comparable Government Bond Rate.

“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded
upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes to be redeemed, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to
the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of
the middle market price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an
independent investment bank selected by us.

The Trustee shall not be responsible for the calculation of, or otherwise obligated to verify, the Comparable Government Bond Rate.

At any time, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuers, or any third party making
such tender offer in lieu of the Issuers, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuers will have the right
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 15 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price paid to each other holder in such tender offer plus, to the extent not
included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

The Notes are also subject to redemption prior to maturity if certain events occur involving changes in the tax law of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction.
If any of these special tax events do occur, the Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption. See “—Redemption for Changes in Taxes”.

After notice of optional redemption has been given as provided in the indenture, if funds for the redemption of any Notes called for redemption
have been made available on the redemption date, and subject to any applicable conditions precedent set forth therein, such Notes called for redemption
will cease to bear interest on the date fixed for the redemption specified in the redemption notice and the only right of the holders of such Notes will be
to receive payment of the redemption price.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the paying agent (or the registrar, as applicable) will select Notes for redemption on a
pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under “—Book-Entry, Delivery and Form” based on the applicable procedures
of the Common Depositary (and in such manner that complies with applicable legal and exchange requirements and the requirements of Euroclear and
Clearstream)). Neither the trustee nor the paying agent shall be liable for selections made by the paying agent (or the registrar, as applicable) in
accordance with this paragraph.

No Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part.

Notice of any optional redemption of any Notes will be given to holders (with a copy to the trustee and paying agent) at their addresses, as shown
in the Notes register, not more than 60 (except as provided below) nor less than 10 days prior to the date fixed for redemption; provided that redemption
notices may be given more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the indenture as to the Notes. The notice of redemption will specify, among other items, the redemption price and the principal amount
of the Notes held by the holder to be redeemed and the conditions precedent, if any, to the redemption.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, notices may be given by delivery
of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.
So long as any Notes are admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted for trading on its Global Exchange Market and the rules of
Euronext Dublin so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Notes shall also be delivered to Euronext Dublin through its online portal,
Euronext Direct, and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuers will notify Euronext Dublin of any change in the principal amount of Notes
outstanding.

The Issuers or their Affiliates are entitled to acquire Notes by means other than a redemption from time to time, including through open market
purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, exchange offers or otherwise, so long as such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms
of the indenture, upon such terms and at such prices as the Issuers or their Affiliates may determine, which may be more or less than the consideration
for which the Notes offered hereby are being sold and may be less than any redemption price then in effect and could be for cash or other consideration.

S-33


-----

Any redemption notice may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of
an Equity Offering (as defined below), financing or other transaction or event. In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the redemption date
may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic
transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date
as so delayed. The Issuers will provide prompt written notice of the rescission of any redemption notice in the same manner in which the notice of
redemption was given, and such redemption notice will thereafter be of no force or effect.

**Redemption for Changes in Taxes**

The Issuers may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at their discretion at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be given in accordance with the procedures described in “—Optional Redemption”), at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date
fixed by the Issuers for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, then due and which will become
due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on which any amount
would be payable in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee of the Notes, the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional
Amounts (but in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount payable cannot be paid by the Issuers or another Guarantor, if any, who can pay
such amount, without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor cannot avoid any such payment obligation by
taking reasonable measures available to it, including by making payment through a different paying agent (provided that changing the jurisdiction of
organization of either Issuer or any Guarantor shall be deemed not to be a reasonable measure), and the requirement arises as a result of:

(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, treaties or any regulations, rulings or other official guidance promulgated thereunder of a
relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment is publicly and formally proposed and becomes effective on or after the date of this
prospectus (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this prospectus, such later date); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws, treaties, regulations, rulings or other official
guidance (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative
practice) which amendment or change is publicly and formally proposed and becomes effective on or after the date of this prospectus (or, if
the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this prospectus, such later date).

The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the
Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis with respect to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the indenture, with respect to a
change or amendments occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the indenture.

The Issuers will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which an Issuer or a relevant Guarantor
would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuers will deliver to the trustee an opinion of outside legal counsel of recognized standing in the relevant Tax

S-34


-----

Jurisdiction attesting to such change in tax law or change in interpretation of tax law and an officer’s certificate attesting to an obligation to pay
Additional Amounts and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts could not be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to them (provided
that changing the jurisdiction of organization of either Issuer or any Guarantor shall be deemed not to be a reasonable measure).

The trustee will accept such officer’s certificate and opinion of counsel reasonably agreed upon as sufficient evidence of the existence and
satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.

**Sinking Fund**

There will be no sinking fund payments for the Notes.

**Priority of the Notes**

The Notes will be:

    - general unsecured obligations of the Issuers;

    - equal in right of payment with all other existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuers, including Indebtedness under the U.S. Credit

Agreement, Australian Credit Agreement, U.K. Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuers;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuers to the extent of the value of the collateral securing

such Indebtedness;

    - structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preferred stock of the Issuers’ subsidiaries; and

    - guaranteed by Parent.

As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions described in the “Prospectus Supplement Summary—Recent Developments” section,
the issuance of the Notes and application of the proceeds from this offering as described in “Use of Proceeds,” the Issuers and Parent would have had
$         billion of indebtedness (none of which would have been secured indebtedness) and the Issuers’ Subsidiaries, none of which will guarantee
the Notes on the date of issuance, would have had no indebtedness, other than MPT Australia Realty Trust’s borrowings under the Australian Credit
Agreement, certain of MPT’s subsidiaries’ borrowings under the U.K. Credit Agreement and the borrowings of certain of Opco’s Subsidiaries under the
U.K. Credit Agreement, all of which indebtedness is included in the Issuers’ and MPT’s indebtedness. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, after giving
effect to the Transactions described in the “Prospectus Supplement Summary—Recent Developments” section, the issuance of the Notes and application
of the proceeds from this offering as described in “Use of Proceeds,” we would have had $         billion of borrowings outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility and $         of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**The Guarantees**

The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Parent and each of the Issuers’ U.S. Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries that borrows
under or guarantees the U.S. Credit Agreement until certain conditions are met. On the date of issuance of the Notes, none of the Issuers’ Restricted
Subsidiaries will be a borrower under or guarantor of the U.S. Credit Agreement and therefore the Notes will initially be guaranteed only by Parent.

Each Guarantee of the Notes will be:

    - a general unsecured obligation of the Guarantor;

S-35


-----

    - equal in right of payment with all other existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Guarantor;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Guarantor;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Guarantor to the extent of the value of the collateral securing

such Indebtedness; and

    - structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preferred stock of the Issuers’ subsidiaries.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void
guarantees and require holders of Notes to return payments received from a guarantor.”

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuers under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantor with respect to any Guarantee of the Notes
will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, such Taxes is then required by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for,
or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which any Issuer or Guarantor is then incorporated or organized,
engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or
through which payment is made by or on behalf of any Issuer or Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any paying agent) or any political subdivision
thereof or therein (each, a “Tax Jurisdiction”) will at any time be required to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuers under or
with respect to the Notes or any Guarantor under or with respect to any Guarantee of the Notes, including payments of principal, redemption price,
purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuers or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as
may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder after such deduction or withholding (including any
such withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such
payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the
holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor
of a power over, the relevant holder, if the relevant holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability company or corporation,
in each case even if the payment is required to be made to such person by the laws of the Tax Jurisdiction) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction
(including being or having been a citizen, resident, or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business
therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein), but excluding any connection arising merely from the holding of such
Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Guarantee of the Notes or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note
or a Guarantee of the Notes;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for payment more than 30 days after the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(4) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes who would have been able to avoid such
withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another paying agent;

(5) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to, the Notes or with respect to any
Guarantee of the Notes;

S-36


-----

(6) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes, following
any Issuer’s written request addressed to the holder or beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial
owner acting reasonably to comply with that request), to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption
from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a
certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction);

(7) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuers or Guarantors to the holder if such holder is a fiduciary or partnership
or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment
had such holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Note;

(8) any U.S. federal withholding Taxes under FATCA;

(9) any Taxes imposed or withheld solely (A) by reason of the beneficial owner owning or having owned, actually or constructively (i) with
respect to any Issuer that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock of such Issuer entitled to vote or (ii) with respect to any Issuer that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal tax
purposes, 10 percent or more of the capital or profits interest in such Issuer, or (B) by reason of the beneficial owner being a bank that has
invested in the Notes as an extension of credit in the ordinary course of its trade or business;

(10) any taxes imposed or withheld in whole or in part by reason of the beneficial owner being or having been any of the following (as these
terms are defined in the Code): a personal holding company; a foreign private foundation or other foreign tax-exempt organization; a
passive foreign investment company; a controlled foreign corporation; or a corporation which has accumulated earnings to avoid U.S.
federal income tax; or

(11) any combination of items (1) through (10) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuers and any Guarantor will also pay and indemnify the holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (including penalties, interest and any other
reasonable expenses properly incurred related thereto) which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of
any of the Notes, the indenture, any Guarantee of the Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes
after this offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, or any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction as a result
of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes or any Guarantee of the Notes.

If any Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment
under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee of the Notes, each of the relevant Issuers or Guarantors, as the case may be, will deliver to the
trustee and each paying agent on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
less than 30 days prior to that payment date, in which case the relevant Issuer or Guarantor shall notify the trustee and each paying agent promptly
thereafter) an officer’s certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The officer’s
certificate(s) must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on
the relevant payment date. The trustee and each paying agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such officer’s certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

The relevant Issuer or Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law with respect to any payment under or relating to the
Notes or any Guarantee of the Notes and will timely remit the full amount

S-37


-----

so deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The relevant Issuer or Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to
obtain tax receipts from each tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The relevant Issuer or Guarantor will furnish
to the trustee and each paying agent, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies
of tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuers or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts,
receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments by such entity.

Whenever in the indenture or in this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of amounts based upon the principal
amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or any Guarantee of the Notes,
such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are,
were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the indenture or any Guarantee of the Notes, any transfer by a
holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to any Issuer or Guarantor is
incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes
any payment on the Notes (or any Guarantee of the Notes) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.

**Certain Calculations and Tests**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the terms in the indenture require (i) compliance with any financial ratio or test
(including, without limitation, the Interest Coverage Ratio or Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio test or Total Unencumbered Assets test) and/or any cap
expressed as a percentage of Adjusted Total Assets or (ii) the absence of a Default or Event of Default (or any type of Default or Event of Default), as a
condition to the consummation of a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such ratio, test, cap expressed as a percentage of
Adjusted Total Assets, Default and/or Event of Default (or any type of Default or Event of Default) shall, at the election of the Issuers, be the date of the
execution of the definitive agreement with respect to such Limited Condition Acquisition, after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and
the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) and such
ratios or tests or caps or Defaults or Events of Default shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition
(including the pro forma adjustments described in the definition of “Interest Coverage Ratio”) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the applicable
period, and for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in
Consolidated EBITDA or consolidated results of operations of the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition
Acquisition, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the
Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (y) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition
Acquisition or related transactions; provided, however, that (a) if any ratio or cap expressed as a percentage of Adjusted Total Assets improves as a
result of such fluctuations, any such improved ratio or cap may be utilized and (b) if the Issuers elect to have such determination occur at the time of
entry into the definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to
have occurred on the date the definitive agreements for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into and outstanding thereafter for
purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the indenture after the date of such definitive agreements and before the consummation of such
Limited Condition Acquisition unless and until such Limited Condition Acquisition has been abandoned, as determined by the Issuers, prior to the
consummation thereof.

**Currency Indemnity**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes and, with respect to the Notes, the Guarantees of the Notes and
the indenture is euro. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees of the Notes in a currency other than euro (whether as
a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuers, any Subsidiary or
otherwise) by the trustee or a holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such holder from any Issuer or Guarantor of the Notes
will constitute a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the euro amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received
or recovered in such other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on
which it is possible to do so). If the euro amount to be recovered is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the
Issuers and each Guarantor of the Notes shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any further purchase of euro in an
amount equal to such difference. These indemnities, to the extent permitted by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuers’ and each Guarantor’s other obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder of a Note or the trustee from time to time; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due
under any Note or any other judgment or order.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment in respect of a Note made in U.S. dollars to the extent permitted by the provisions described in “—Issuance
in Euros” will not be subject to the provisions described in this section.

**Certain Covenants**

**Suspension of Covenants**

The indenture governing the Notes will provide that if the Notes have Investment Grade Status from at least two of three Rating Agencies, several
material covenants included in the indenture will be suspended or become more lenient, as the case may be, if we provide notice of such ratings to the
trustee, until such time as the Notes no longer have Investment Grade Status from at least two of three Ratings Agencies.

During a Suspension Period, the Parent, Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants contained in the
indenture (each a “Suspended Covenant”):

    - Limitation on Restricted Payments;

    - Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;

    - Future Guarantees by U.S. Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries;

    - Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates;

    - Limitation on Asset Sales;

    - Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control and Rating Decline;

    - Clause (3) of Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.

All other provisions of the indenture will apply at all times during any Suspension Period so long as any Notes remain outstanding thereunder;
provided that the Interest Coverage Ratio that will be applicable under clause (3) of Limitation on Indebtedness will be 1.5 to 1.0 during any Suspension
Period.

S-39


-----

“Suspension Period” means any period:

(1) beginning on the date that:

(A) the Notes have Investment Grade Status from at least two of three Rating Agencies;

(B) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and

(C) the Issuers have delivered an officer’s certificate to the trustee certifying that the conditions set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above are
satisfied; and

(2) ending on the date (the “Reversion Date”) that the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status from at least two of three Rating Agencies.
On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness, liens thereon and dividend blockages incurred during the Suspension Period prior to such
Reversion Date will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date under the indenture.

For purposes of calculating the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (C) of the first paragraph of the “Limitation on
Restricted Payments” covenant, calculations under that clause will be made with reference to the Transaction Date, as set forth in that clause.
Accordingly, (x) Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period not otherwise permitted pursuant to any of clauses (1) through (12) under the
second paragraph under the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under
clause (C) of the first paragraph of such covenant; provided, however, that the amount available to be made as a Restricted Payment on the Transaction
Date shall not be reduced to below zero solely as a result of such Restricted Payments, but may be reduced to below zero as a result of negative
cumulative Funds From Operations during the Suspension Period for the purpose of clause (C)(i) of the first paragraph of such covenant, and (y) the
items specified in clauses (C)(i)-(vi) of the first paragraph of such covenant that occur during the Suspension Period will increase the amount available
to be made as a Restricted Payment under clause (C) of the first paragraph of such covenant. Any Restricted Payment made during the Suspension
Period that is of the type described in the second paragraph of the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant (other than the Restricted Payment
referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of such second paragraph or any exchange of Capital Stock for Capital Stock or Indebtedness referred to in clause (4) or
(5) of such second paragraph), and the Net Cash Proceeds from any issuance of Capital Stock referred to in clauses (4) and (5) of the second paragraph
of the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant (adjusted to avoid double counting) shall not be included in calculating the amounts permitted to
be incurred under such clause (C) on each Reversion Date. For purposes of the “Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant, on each Reversion Date, the
unutilized Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date (or thereafter)
under any Suspended Covenant solely as a result of any actions taken by the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiaries thereof, or events occurring, during
the Suspension Period. For purposes of the “Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets” covenant, if the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not
in compliance with such covenant as of a Reversion Date, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred for up to 120 days following
the Reversion Date; provided that neither the Parent nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall incur any Secured Indebtedness until such time that the
requirements of such covenant have been met.

**Limitation on Indebtedness**

(1) The Issuers will not and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if,
immediately after giving effect to the Incurrence of such additional Indebtedness and the receipt and application of the proceeds therefrom, the
aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis would be greater
than 60% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

(2) The Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Secured Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness
that is Secured Indebtedness) if, immediately after giving effect to the Incurrence of such additional Secured Indebtedness and the receipt and
application of the

S-40


-----

proceeds therefrom, the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Secured Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis would be greater than 40% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

(3) The Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided,
_however, that the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, after giving effect to_
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and the receipt and application of the proceeds therefrom, the Interest Coverage Ratio of the Issuers and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis would be at least 2.0 to 1.0.

(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), (2) or (3) above, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (except as specified below) may Incur each and
all of the following:

(A) Indebtedness of the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding under any Credit Facility at any time in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $6,630.0 million and (y) 30% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the
Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred under clause (M) below in respect of
such Indebtedness shall be deemed to have been incurred under this clause (A) for purposes of determining the amount of Indebtedness
that may at any time be incurred under this clause (A);

(B) Indebtedness of the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries owed to:

(i) the Issuers evidenced by an unsubordinated promissory note, or

_provided, however, that any event that results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuers or any subsequent_
transfer of such Indebtedness (other than to the Issuers or any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuers) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an
Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (B);

(C) Indebtedness of the Issuers or any of their Restricted Subsidiaries under Currency Agreements and Interest Rate Agreements; provided that
such agreements (i) are designed solely to protect the Issuers or any of their Restricted Subsidiaries against fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates or interest rates (whether fluctuations of fixed to floating rate interest or floating to fixed rate interest) and (ii) do not
increase the Indebtedness of the obligor outstanding at any time other than as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or
interest rates or by reason of fees, indemnities and compensation payable thereunder;

(D) Indebtedness of the Issuers or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, to the extent the net proceeds thereof are promptly:

(i) used to purchase Notes tendered in a Change of Control Offer made as a result of a Change in Control Triggering Event,

permitted by and made in accordance with the “Future Guarantees by U.S. Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries” covenant described below,
and (ii) Guarantees by a Subsidiary Guarantor of any Indebtedness of any other Subsidiary Guarantor;

arrangements, overdraft protections and similar arrangements in each case in connection with deposit accounts;

(L) Indebtedness supported by a letter of credit procured by the Issuers or their Restricted Subsidiaries in a principal amount not in excess of
the stated amount of such letter of credit and where the underlying Indebtedness would otherwise be permitted;

(M) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace,
Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the indenture to be incurred under the provisions of paragraph
(1), (2) or (3) of this covenant or clause (A), (F), (G), (M) or (O) of this paragraph (4);

(N) Indebtedness (including Capitalized Lease Obligations) Incurred by the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary within 270 days of the related
purchase, lease or improvement, to finance the purchase, lease or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment used in the
business of the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person
owning such assets in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the greater of (x) $884.0 million and (y)
4.0% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries at any time outstanding; or

(O) Additional Indebtedness of the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries in aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to
exceed the greater of (x) $884.0 million and (y) 4.0% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries;
_provided, however, that any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred under clause (M) above in respect of such Indebtedness shall be_
deemed to have been incurred under this clause (O) for purposes of determining the amount of Indebtedness that may at any time be
incurred under this clause (O).

(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Parent, the
Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur pursuant to this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies.

(6) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant,(i) Indebtedness Incurred
and outstanding under the U.S. Credit Agreement on or prior to the Issue Date shall be treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (A) of paragraph
(4) of this “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant and may not be reclassified, and (ii) Guarantees, Liens or obligations with respect to letters of
credit supporting Indebtedness otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount shall not be included.

(7) For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the
categories of permitted Indebtedness described in clauses (A) through (O) of paragraph (4) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to
paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above, the Issuers shall, in their sole discretion, be entitled to classify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness on
the date of its incurrence or issuance and determine the order of such incurrence or issuance (and may later reclassify such item of Indebtedness)
and may divide and classify such Indebtedness in more than one of the

S-42


-----

types of Indebtedness described, and, in such event, such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) will be treated as being incurred or existing
pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof) without giving pro forma effect to such item (or portion thereof) when calculating
the amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to any other clause or paragraph. At any time that the Issuers or the Restricted
Subsidiaries would be entitled to have incurred any then outstanding Indebtedness under clause (1), (2) and (3) of this covenant, such Indebtedness
shall be automatically reclassified into Indebtedness incurred pursuant to those paragraphs. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be
permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness, but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, the outstanding principal amount of any
particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once and any obligations arising under any guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument
supporting such Indebtedness shall not be double counted.

(8) For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Dollar-equivalent
principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, however, that
if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable Dollar denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any committed amounts associated therewith (if
the Issuers elected to have such commitment deemed to be Incurred at the time of the commitment in accordance with the last paragraph of the
definition of “Incur”), the amount of any reasonable premium (including reasonable tender premiums), defeasance costs and any reasonable fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of such new Indebtedness. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange
rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets**

The Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries will maintain Total Unencumbered Assets of not less than 150% of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.

**Limitation on Restricted Payments**

Opco will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or with respect to Capital Stock of Opco or any Restricted Subsidiary held by
Persons other than Opco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than (i) dividends or distributions payable solely in shares of its Capital Stock
(other than Disqualified Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of such Capital Stock and (ii) pro rata dividends or other
distributions made by a Restricted Subsidiary of Opco that is not Wholly Owned to minority stockholders (or owners of equivalent interests in the
event such Subsidiary is not a corporation);

such shares of Capital Stock) of Opco or any of its direct or indirect parent entities held by any Person (other than a Restricted Subsidiary);

Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case excluding (i) any intercompany Indebtedness between or
among the Parent, the Issuers or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors; (ii) the payment, purchase, redemption, defeasance, acquisition or retirement
(collectively, a “purchase”) of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or
final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such payment, purchase, redemption, defeasance, acquisition or retirement and
(iii) the giving of an irrevocable notice of redemption with respect to a transaction described in clauses (3) or (5) of the second paragraph of this
covenant; or

(4) make an Investment, other than a Permitted Investment, in any Person

(B) the Issuers could not Incur at least $1.00 of Indebtedness under paragraphs (1) and (3) of the “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, or

(C) the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments (the amount, if other than in cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Issuers, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution) made after April 26, 2011 shall exceed the
sum of, without duplication:

(i) 95% of the aggregate amount of the Funds From Operations (or, if the Funds From Operations is a loss, minus 100% of the amount of
such loss) accrued on a cumulative basis during the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning April 1, 2011 and ending on the last day of
the last fiscal quarter preceding the Transaction Date for which reports have been filed with the SEC or provided to the trustee pursuant to the
“SEC Reports and Reports to Holders” covenant, plus

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuers after April 26, 2011 from (x) the issuance and sale of Opco’s Capital
Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) or (y) the issuance and sale of Parent’s Capital Stock (to the extent contributed to Opco as Capital Stock
(other than Disqualified Stock)) to a Person who is not a Subsidiary of the Parent, including from an issuance or sale permitted by the indenture of
Indebtedness of the Issuers or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for cash subsequent to April 26, 2011 upon the conversion of such Indebtedness
into Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of Opco or Parent, or from the issuance to a Person who is not a Subsidiary of the Parent of any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire Capital Stock of Opco or Parent (in each case, exclusive of any Disqualified Stock or any options,
warrants or other rights that are redeemable at the option of the holder for cash or Indebtedness, or are required to be redeemed, prior to the Stated
Maturity of the Notes), plus

(iii) 100% of (x) the aggregate net cash proceeds and (y) the fair market value of other property, in any such case, received by means of the
sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary) of Restricted Investments made by the Issuers or a Restricted
Subsidiary and repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than by the Issuers
or a Restricted Subsidiary) and repayments of loans or advances that constitute Restricted Investments made by the Issuers or a Restricted
Subsidiary, in each case after April 26, 2011 (except, in each case, to the extent any such payment or proceeds are included in the calculation of
Funds From Operations), plus

(iv) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of
an Unrestricted Subsidiary into one of the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary to one of the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary after April 26, 2011, the fair market value, as determined in good faith by
the Issuers (or if such fair market value exceeds the greater of (x) $442.0 million and (y) 2.0% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, as determined in writing by a nationally recognized investment banking, appraisal or accounting firm), of the
Investment in such

-----

Unrestricted Subsidiary or the assets transferred at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or at
the time of such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or transfer of assets (other than to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary
constituted a Permitted Investment), plus

(v) the fair market value of non-cash tangible assets or Capital Stock acquired in exchange for an issuance of Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock or Capital Stock issued in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuers or Parent utilized pursuant to clauses (3) or (4) of the
succeeding paragraph) of Opco or, to the extent contributed to Opco or one or more Restricted Subsidiaries, the Parent, in each case, subsequent to
April 26, 2011 (including upon conversion or exchange of the Common Units for Capital Stock of the Parent, in which case the fair market value
shall equal the fair market value received upon issuance of such Common Units), plus

(vi) without duplication, in the event the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary makes any Investment in a Person that, as a result of or in
connection with such Investment, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount not to exceed the amount of Investments previously made by the
Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries in such Person that was treated as a Restricted Payment.

As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions described in the “Prospectus Supplement Summary—Recent Developments” section,
there was approximately $5.6 billion available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the foregoing clause (C).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations on Restricted Payments described above shall not apply to the following:

(1) any distribution or other action that the Issuers believe in good faith is necessary to maintain the Parent’s status as a REIT under the
Code, if the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
determined in accordance with GAAP is less than 60% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of
the end of the fiscal quarter covered in the Parent’s annual or quarterly report most recently furnished to holders of the Notes or filed with the
SEC, as the case may be;

(2) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption within 60 days after the date of

of Opco (collectively, including any such contributions, “Refunding Capital Stock”) (with any offering within 90 days deemed as substantially
concurrent); and (b) the declaration and payment of accrued dividends on any Capital Stock redeemed, repurchased, retired, defeased or acquired
out of the proceeds of the sale of Refunding Capital Stock within 90 days of such sale; provided, that the amount of any such proceeds or

(ii) of this covenant;

(5) the payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Subordinated Indebtedness, including
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest with the proceeds

S-45


-----

of, or in exchange for, an issuance of, shares of Capital Stock of the Parent or Opco (or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital
Stock) that occurs within 90 days of such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value; provided, that
the amount of any such proceeds or contributions that are utilized for any Restricted Payments pursuant to this clause (5) shall be excluded from
the amount described in clause (4)(C)(ii) of this covenant;

any shares of Capital Stock of the Parent held by any of the Parent’s or Medical Property Trust LLC’s Subsidiaries and (y) the repurchase,
redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any shares of Capital Stock of Opco or any Restricted Subsidiary in each case held by

transferees, assigns, estates or heirs of any of the foregoing); provided, however, the aggregate amount distributed or dividended to Parent and
paid by the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to this clause (6) shall not exceed the greater of (x) $111.0 million and (y) 0.5% of
consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, in any calendar year (excluding for purposes of calculating such
amount the amount paid for Capital Stock repurchased, redeemed, acquired or retired with the cash proceeds from the repayment of outstanding
loans previously made by the Parent, an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof for the purpose of financing the acquisition of such Capital
Stock), with unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to the next two succeeding calendar years; provided further, that such amount
in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed (A) the Net Cash Proceeds from the sale of Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock) of Opco or Parent to the extent contributed to Opco or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries by members of management, directors
or consultants of the Parent, Opco or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries that occurs after April 26, 2011, to the extent such proceeds (i) have not
otherwise been and are not thereafter applied to the payment of any other Restricted Payment or (ii) are not attributable to loans made by the

permitted transferees, assigns, estates or heirs of any of the foregoing) of the Parent, an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof in connection
with a repurchase of Capital Stock of the Parent, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute a Restricted Payment
for purposes of the indenture;

(7)(x) distributions or dividends to Parent, the proceeds of which are used and (y) payments made or expected to be made by the Issuers or
any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, in respect of withholding or similar taxes payable upon exercise of Capital Stock by any future, present or
former employee, director, officer, manager or consultant (or any permitted transferees, assigns, estates or heirs of any of the foregoing) and any
repurchases of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon exercise of stock options or warrants if such Capital Stock represents a portion of the exercise
price of such options or warrants or required withholding or similar taxes and cashless repurchases of Capital Stock deemed to occur upon
exercise of stock options or warrants if such Capital Stock represent a portion of the exercise price of such options or warrants;

(8) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Subordinated Indebtedness or Preferred Stock of any Issuer

exercisable or convertible into Capital Stock of the Parent and the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of Capital Stock
upon exercise or conversion of securities exercisable or convertible into Capital Stock of Opco;

(11) additional Restricted Payments so long as, after giving pro forma effect thereto (including any incurrence and/or repayment of
Indebtedness in connection therewith), the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of the most
recent fiscal quarter or year; or

(12) additional Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $1,547.0 million and (y) 7.0% of consolidated
Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries at any time outstanding;

_provided, however, that, in the case of clauses (6), (11) and (12), no Default and no Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing or occur as a_
direct consequence of the actions or payments set forth therein.

The net amount of any Restricted Payment permitted pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) of the immediately preceding paragraph (adjusted to avoid
double counting) shall be included in calculating whether the conditions of clause (C) of the first paragraph of this “Limitation on Restricted Payments”
covenant have been met with respect to any subsequent Restricted Payments. The net amount of any Restricted Payment permitted pursuant to clauses
(3) through (12) of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be excluded in calculating whether the conditions of clause (C) of the first paragraph of
this “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant have been met with respect to any subsequent Restricted Payments. The amount of all Restricted
Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or
issued to or by the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a payment or other action meets the criteria of more than one of the
exceptions described in clauses (1) through (12) above, or is permitted to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant (including by virtue of
qualifying as a Permitted Investment), the Issuers will be permitted to classify such payment or other action on the date of its occurrence in any manner
that complies with this covenant. Payments or other actions permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such payment or other action but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant
permitting such payment or other action (including pursuant to any section of the definition of “Permitted Investment”) For purposes of determining
compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on Restricted Payments denominated in a foreign currency, the Dollar-equivalent amount of such
Restricted Payment shall be calculated based the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Restricted Payment was made.

**Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Issuers will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiaries to, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any
consensual encumbrance or restriction of any kind on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions permitted by applicable law on any Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary owned by
an Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(B) pay any Indebtedness owed to an Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(C) make loans or advances to an Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(D) transfer its property or assets to an Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary.

The foregoing provisions shall not restrict any encumbrances or restrictions:

(1) existing under, by reason of or with respect to, the indenture, the U.S. Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement, the U.K.
Credit Agreement and any other agreement in effect on the Issue

S-47


-----

Date as in effect on the Issue Date, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, extensions, increases, supplements, refundings, refinancing,
renewals or replacements of such agreements; provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions in any such amendments, modifications,
restatements, extensions, increases, supplements, refundings, refinancing, renewals or replacements are not materially more restrictive, taken as a
whole, than those in effect on the Issue Date;

(2) existing under, by reason of or with respect to any other Indebtedness of the Issuers or their Restricted Subsidiaries permitted under the
indenture; provided, however, that the Issuers have determined in good faith that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the agreement or
agreements governing the other Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in customary comparable
financings and will not impair in any material respect the Issuers’ and Guarantors’ ability to make payments on the Notes and Guarantees thereof
when due;

(3) existing with respect to any Person or the property or assets of such Person acquired by an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, existing at
the time of such acquisition and not incurred in contemplation thereof, which encumbrances or restrictions are not applicable to any Person or the
property or assets of any Person other than such Person or the property or assets of such Person so acquired and any amendments, modifications,
restatements, extensions, increases, supplements, refundings, refinancing, renewals or replacements thereof; provided, however, that the
encumbrances and restrictions in any such amendments, modifications, restatements, extensions, increases, supplements, refundings, refinancing,
renewals or replacements are entered into in the ordinary course of business or are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those
contained in the instruments or agreements with respect to such Person or its property or assets as in effect on the date of such acquisition;

(4) existing under, by reason of or with respect to provisions in joint venture, operating or similar agreements;

(5) in the case of clause (D) in the first paragraph of this “Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries” covenant:

(a) that restrict in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is a lease, license,
conveyance or contract or similar property or asset,

(b) existing by virtue of any transfer of, agreement to transfer, option or right with respect to, or Lien on, any property or assets of an
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise prohibited by the indenture,

(c) existing under, by reason of or with respect to (i) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of
business or (ii) capital leases or operating leases that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired or covered thereby,
or

(d) arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business, not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in the
aggregate, detract from the value of property or assets of an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to an Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor which was previously an Unrestricted
Subsidiary pursuant to or by reason of an agreement that such Subsidiary is a party to or entered into before the date on which such Subsidiary
became a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such agreement was not entered into in anticipation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary and any such encumbrance or restriction does not extend to any assets or property of the Issuers or any other Restricted
Subsidiary other than the assets and property of such Subsidiary;

(7) with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary and imposed pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into for the sale or disposition of the
Capital Stock of, or property and assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing
of such sale or other disposition; or

S-48


-----

(8) encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of applicable law, regulation, order, approval, license, permit or similar
restriction or agreement with governmental authorities with respect to assets located in their jurisdiction.

Nothing contained in this “Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” covenant shall prevent an
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from restricting the sale or other disposition of property or assets of an Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that secure Indebtedness of the Issuers or any of their Restricted Subsidiaries. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the
priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to distributions being paid on common stock shall not be deemed
a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock, and (2) the subordination of loans or advances made to a Restricted Subsidiary to other
Indebtedness incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**Future Guarantees by U.S. Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Issuers will cause each U.S. Domestic Restricted Subsidiary that borrows under or Guarantees the U.S. Credit Agreement to, within 30 days
thereof, execute and deliver to the trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will unconditionally Guarantee, on a
joint and several basis, the full and prompt payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest in respect of the Notes on a senior basis and all
other obligations under the indenture.

Any Subsidiary Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary shall provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon:

(1) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person that is not a Subsidiary of an Issuer of Capital Stock held by an Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary (which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited by the
indenture) such that, immediately after giving effect to such transaction, such Restricted Subsidiary would no longer constitute a Subsidiary of an
Issuer;

(2) in connection with the merger or consolidation of a Subsidiary Guarantor with (a) an Issuer or (b) any other Subsidiary Guarantor
(provided that the surviving entity remains a Subsidiary Guarantor);

(3) if the Issuers properly designate any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the
indenture;

(4) upon the Legal Defeasance (as defined below) or Covenant Defeasance (as defined below) or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture;

(5) upon a liquidation or dissolution of a Subsidiary Guarantor permitted under the indenture; or

(6) the release or discharge of the Guarantee that resulted in the creation of such Subsidiary Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as
a result of payment under such Guarantee.

In addition, any Subsidiary Guarantee shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged if such Subsidiary ceases to Guarantee
obligations under the U.S. Credit Agreement or ceases to constitute a co-borrower with respect to the U.S. Credit Agreement.

**Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates**

The Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into, renew or extend any transaction
(including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of property or assets, or the rendering of any service) with any holder (or any Affiliate of such holder) of
10% or more of any class of Capital Stock of the Parent or with any Affiliate of the Parent, an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case

S-49


-----

involving consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $66.3 million and (y) 0.3% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, except upon terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary than could be obtained, at the time of
such transaction or, if such transaction is pursuant to a written agreement, at the time of the execution of the agreement providing therefor, in a
comparable arm’s length transaction with a Person that is not such a holder or an Affiliate, or if in the good faith judgment of the Parent’s Board of
Directors, no comparable transaction is available with which to compare such transaction, such transaction is otherwise fair to the Issuers or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view.

The foregoing limitation does not limit, and shall not apply to:

(1) transactions (A) approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Board of Directors of the Parent, or where no such
disinterested directors exist, by unanimous approval of the directors of the Board of Directors of the Parent or (B) for which the Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the trustee a written opinion of a nationally recognized investment banking, appraisal or accounting firm stating
that the transaction is fair to the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view;

(2) any transaction solely between an Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or solely between Restricted Subsidiaries;

(3) the payment of reasonable fees and compensation (including through the issuance of Capital Stock) to, and indemnification and similar
arrangements on behalf of, current, former or future directors, officers, employees or consultants of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent;

(4) the issuance or sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of an Issuer;

(5) any Restricted Payments not prohibited by the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant and Investments constituting Permitted
Investments;

(6) any contracts, instruments or other agreements or arrangements in each case as in effect on the date of the indenture, and any transactions
pursuant thereto or contemplated thereby, or any amendment, modification or supplement thereto or any replacement thereof entered into from
time to time, as long as such agreement or arrangements as so amended, modified, supplemented or replaced, taken as a whole, is not materially
more disadvantageous to the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries at the time executed than the original agreement or arrangements as in effect
on the date of the indenture;

(7) any employment, consulting, service or termination agreement, or customary indemnification arrangements, entered into by an Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary with current, former or future officers and employees of the Parent or an Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary and the
payment of compensation to officers and employees of the Parent, an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (including amounts paid pursuant to
employee benefit plans, employee stock option or similar plans), in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(8) loans and advances to officers and employees of the Parent, an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or guarantees in respect thereof (or
cancellation of such loans, advances or guarantees), for bona fide business purposes, including for reasonable moving and relocation,
entertainment and travel expenses and similar expenses, made in the ordinary course of business;

(9) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Parent or an Issuer solely because the Parent or an Issuer, directly or indirectly, owns
Capital Stock of, or controls such Person;

(10) any transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate immediately before the consummation of such transaction that becomes an
Affiliate as a result of such transaction; or

(11) the entering into or amending of any tax sharing, allocation or similar agreement and any payments thereunder.

**SEC Reports and Reports to Holders**

Whether or not Opco is then required to file reports with the SEC, Opco shall file with the SEC all such reports and other information as it would
be required to file with the SEC by Sections 13(a) or 15(d) under the Exchange Act if it was subject thereto; provided, however, that, if filing such
documents by Opco with the SEC is not permitted under the Exchange Act, Opco shall, within 15 days after the time Opco would be required to file
such information with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) under the Exchange Act, provide such documents and reports to the trustee and
upon written request supply copies of such documents and reports to any holder and shall post such documents and reports on Opco’s public website.
Opco shall supply the trustee and each holder or shall supply to the trustee for forwarding to each such holder, without cost to such holder, copies of
such reports and other information. Delivery of such information, documents and reports to the trustee is for informational purposes only and the
trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein,
including the Issuers compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on officer’s certificates). The
trustee shall have no duty to monitor whether any such filings on EDGAR have been made.

So long as permitted by the SEC, at any time that either (x) one or more Subsidiaries of Opco is an Unrestricted Subsidiary or (y) Opco holds
directly any material assets (including Capital Stock) other than the Capital Stock of the Issuers, then the quarterly and annual financial information
required by this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” or any other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuers and their Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries and other material assets of the Issuers.

Opco shall also, within a reasonably prompt period of time following the disclosure of the annual and quarterly information required above,
conduct a conference call with respect to such information and results of operations for the relevant reporting period. No fewer than three Business Days
prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with the preceding sentence, Opco shall issue a press release to the appropriate
internationally recognized wire services announcing the date that such information will be available and the time and date of such conference call.

So long as the Parent is a Guarantor of the Notes, the indenture will permit Opco to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to filing,
furnishing, providing and posting documents, reports and other information relating to Opco by the Parent’s filing, furnishing, providing and posting, as
the case may be, of such documents, reports and other information relating to the Parent; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating
information that explains in reasonable detail and in the same manner described in this prospectus the differences between the information relating to the
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the information relating to the Parent and the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors, if any,
on a standalone basis, on the other hand, as of the ending date of the period covered by such report.

For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this “—Reports to Holders” section
and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuers will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any
Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

**Limitation on Asset Sales**

The Issuers will not, and will not permit any of their Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate any Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the consideration received by the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary (including by way of relief from, or by way of any other Person
assuming sole responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) is at least equal to the fair market value of the assets sold or
disposed of (such fair market value to be determined as of the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale); and

S-51


-----

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received from such Asset Sale consists of cash, Temporary Cash Investments or Replacement Assets, or a
combination of cash, Temporary Cash Investments or Replacement Assets; provided, however, with respect to the sale of one or more
properties that up to 75% of the consideration may consist of indebtedness of the purchaser of such properties so long as such Indebtedness
is secured by a first priority Lien on the property or properties sold.

For purposes of this provision, each of the following shall be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities of the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary (as shown on the most recent consolidated balance sheet of the Issuers and their
Restricted Subsidiaries other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Guarantee)
that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to an agreement that releases the Issuers or any such Restricted Subsidiary
from further liability with respect to such liabilities or that are assumed by contract or operation of law;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by an Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by
such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Temporary Cash Investments within 180 days (to the extent of the cash or Temporary
Cash Investments received in that conversion); and

(c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuers or any such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate
fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at the time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $442.0 million and (y) 2.0% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the
Restricted Subsidiaries at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Issuers or any such Restricted Subsidiary may apply such Net
Cash Proceeds:

(1) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuers or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is Secured Indebtedness (in each
case other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuers or an Affiliate of the Issuers);

(2) to make an Investment in (provided such Investment is in the form of Capital Stock), or to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a
Person engaged in a Permitted Business if such Person is, or will become as a result thereof, a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase (x) Pari Passu Indebtedness of an Issuer or of any Subsidiary Guarantor; provided, however, that if
the Issuers or a Guarantor shall so prepay, repay, redeem or purchase any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, the Issuers will equally and ratably
reduce obligations under the Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the indenture, through open market purchases (to the extent
such purchasers are at a purchase price at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any) or by
making an offer to all holders of Notes to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
(and such offer shall be deemed for purposes of this covenant to be a use of proceeds from an Asset Sale equal to the aggregate amount of
Net Cash Proceeds offered to the holders, whether or not the offer is accepted by any or all holders) or (y) any Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor;

(4) to fund all or a portion of an optional redemption of the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption;”

(5) to make a capital expenditure;

S-52


-----

(6) to acquire Replacement Assets to be used or that are useful in a Permitted Business; or

(7) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided, that the Issuers will be deemed to have complied with the provisions described in clauses (2), (5) and (6) of this paragraph if and to the extent_
that, within 450 days after the Asset Sale that generated the Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries has entered into and not
abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to acquire the assets or Capital Stock of a Permitted Business, acquire Replacement Assets or make a capital
expenditure in compliance with the provisions described in clauses (2), (5) and (6) of this paragraph (each an “Acceptable Commitment”), and that
Acceptable Commitment (or a replacement commitment should the Acceptable Commitment be subsequently cancelled or terminated for any reason) is
thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 450-day period. Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuers may
temporarily reduce the revolving Indebtedness under any Credit Facility or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited
by the indenture. The amount of such excess Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied (or to be committed to be applied) during such 450 day period as
set forth in the third paragraph above and not so applied by the end of such period shall constitute “Excess Proceeds.”

When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $221.0 million and (y) 1.0% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of
the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries (the “Excess Proceeds Cap”), the Issuers shall make an offer to all holders of the Notes and, if required by the
terms of any Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness, to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness on a pro rata basis (an “Asset Sale Offer”), to
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is in an amount equal to at least €100,000, that
may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value
thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the indenture. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days
after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Cap by delivering the notice required pursuant to the terms of the indenture, with a copy
to the trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Excess Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer
with respect to such Excess Proceeds prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days or with respect to Excess Proceeds equal to the Excess Proceeds
Cap or less.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the
registrar shall select the Notes and the Issuers shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value
or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds that resulted in the Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero.

Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Cash Proceeds may apply such Net Cash
Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner not
prohibited by the indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, in the case of Net Cash Proceeds received by any
non-Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary, only that portion of such proceeds that are allocable (based on economic share and not necessarily percentage
ownership) to the Issuers will be subject to the requirement to make an offer in accordance with this covenant and will be applied towards the Excess
Proceeds Cap.

S-53


-----

Notwithstanding the above, the Issuers shall not be required to make an Asset Sale Offer with respect to any amount:

(1) to the extent that the relevant Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sales by a Foreign Restricted Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is
prohibited, restricted or delayed under any Requirements of Law, from being repatriated to the United States, an amount equal to the
portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may
be retained by the Foreign Restricted Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the Requirements of Law will not permit repatriation to the
United States (the Issuers hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Foreign Restricted Subsidiary to promptly take all commercially
reasonable actions (as determined by the Issuers’ reasonable business judgment) required to permit such repatriation); it being understood
and agreed that once the repatriation of the relevant affected Net Cash Proceeds is permitted under Requirements of Law, the relevant
Foreign Restricted Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Net Cash Proceeds and the repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be
applied within ten business days (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) to make an Asset Sale Offer to the
extent required herein; or

(2) to the extent that the relevant Net Cash Proceeds are received in respect of any joint venture for so long as the distribution to the Issuers of
such Net Cash Proceeds would be prohibited under the organizational documents governing such joint venture (so long as such distribution
restrictions were not implemented for the purpose of avoiding mandatory repurchase requirements); it being understood and agreed that
once such distribution is permitted under the organizational documents governing such joint venture, the relevant joint venture will
promptly distribute the relevant Net Cash Proceeds and the distributed Net Cash Proceeds will be applied within 10 business days to make
an Asset Sale Offer to the extent required herein.

Notwithstanding the above, if the Issuers determine in good faith that the repatriation to the Issuers as a distribution or dividend of any amounts
required to make an Asset Sale Offer that are attributable to any Foreign Restricted Subsidiary would result in a material and adverse Tax liability
(including any withholding Tax) (such amount, a “Restricted Amount”), the amount with respect to which the Issuers shall be required to make an Asset
Sale Offer shall be reduced by the Restricted Amount; provided that to the extent that the repatriation of the relevant Net Cash Proceeds from the
relevant Foreign Restricted Subsidiary would no longer have a material and adverse tax consequence, an amount equal to the Restricted Amount
(reduced by any relevant Taxes) will be applied within ten business days to make an Asset Sale Offer to the extent required herein.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to
the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may rely on any
no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies
certain conditions.

The U.S. Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement and the U.K. Credit Agreement limit, and future credit agreements or other
agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuers become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this
Asset Sale covenant. In the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders to the purchase
of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the indebtedness that contains such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such
indebtedness, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an
Event of Default under the indenture.

S-54


-----

The provisions under the indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be
waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets**

No Issuer will consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its and its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ (taken as a whole) property and assets (as an entirety or substantially an entirety in one transaction or a series of related
transactions) to, any Person or permit any Person (other than a Restricted Subsidiary) to merge with or into it unless:

(1) such Issuer shall be the continuing Person, or the Person (if other than such Issuer) formed by such consolidation or into which such Issuer
is merged or that acquired such property and assets of such Issuer shall be a corporation, limited liability company, partnership (including a
limited partnership) or trust organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America or any state or jurisdiction
thereof and shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the trustee, all of the obligations of such Issuer
with respect to the Notes and under the indenture (provided that in the case of a limited liability company, partnership (including a limited
partnership) or trust, there shall also be a corporation organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America or any
state or jurisdiction thereof which shall expressly jointly with such limited liability company, partnership (including a limited partnership)
or trust, assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the trustee, all of the obligations of such Issuer with respect to the
Notes and under the indenture);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable Four-Quarter Period, on a pro forma basis the Issuers, or any Person becoming the successor obligor of the Notes, as the
case may be, (a) could Incur at least $1.00 of Indebtedness under paragraphs (1) and (3) of the “Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant or
(b) the Interest Coverage Ratio would improve; provided, however, that this clause (3) shall not apply to a consolidation or merger with or
into a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary; and

(4) if such Issuer is not the continuing Person, the Issuers deliver to the trustee an officer’s certificate (attaching the arithmetic computations to
demonstrate compliance with clause (3) above) and an opinion of counsel (which may be subject to customary qualifications), in each case
stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture complies with this covenant and that all conditions
precedent provided for herein relating to such transaction have been complied with and, with respect to the opinion of counsel, that the
supplemental indenture constitutes a valid and binding obligation enforceable against the Issuers, or the Person (if other than an Issuer)
formed by such consolidation or into which such Issuer is merged or that acquired all or substantially all of such Issuer’s and its Restricted
Subsidiaries’ property and assets;

_provided, however, that clause (3) above does not apply if, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Parent, whose determination_
shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution, the principal purpose of such transaction is to change the state of domicile of an Issuer; provided, further,
_however, that any such transaction shall not have as one of its purposes the evasion of the foregoing limitations._

The Issuers will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey or transfer, in one transaction or a series
of transactions, all or substantially all of its property and assets to any Person unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not such Subsidiary) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction under which such Subsidiary was organized or under the

S-55


-----

laws of the United States of America, or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person shall expressly assume, by a
supplemental indenture, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, under the Notes or its Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable;
provided, however, that the foregoing requirement will not apply in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor or all or substantially all of its
property and assets (x) that has been disposed of in its entirety to another Person (other than to an Issuer or an Affiliate of an Issuer),
whether through a merger, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets or (y) that, as a result of the disposition of all or a portion of its
Capital Stock, ceases to be a Subsidiary, so long as, in both cases, in connection therewith the Issuers provide an officer’s certificate to the
trustee to the effect that the Issuers will comply with their obligations under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Asset Sales”;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or transactions on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an
obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person as a result of such transaction as having been issued by such Person at the time of
such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(3) the Issuers deliver to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel (which may be subject to customary qualifications), each
stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture, if any, complies with the indenture and, with respect to
the opinion of counsel, that the supplemental indenture constitutes a valid and binding obligation enforceable against the Issuers, the
Subsidiary Guarantors, the Parent and the surviving Persons.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor may (i) merge with an Affiliate of an Issuer or an Affiliate or a Restricted Subsidiary or
another Subsidiary Guarantor solely for the purpose of changing the state of domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor, (ii) merge with or into or transfer all
or part of its properties and assets to another Subsidiary Guarantor or the Issuers, or (iii) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership,
limited liability company or trust organized under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Subsidiary Guarantor, provided that such surviving
Person (if not a Subsidiary Guarantor) shall expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, if any,
under the Notes and its Subsidiary Guarantee.

**Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control and Rating Decline**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuers to purchase some or all (in
minimum principal amounts of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000) of such holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of
Control Offer”).

Any Change of Control Offer will include a cash offer price of 101% of the principal amount of any Notes purchased plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”). If a Change of Control Offer is required,
within ten Business Days following a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers will mail a notice to each holder (with a copy to the trustee)
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute, or are expected to constitute, the Change of Control Triggering Event, and offering to
repurchase Notes on a specified date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”). The Change of Control Payment Date will be no earlier than 30 days and
no later than 60 days from the date the notice is mailed (or in the case of global notes, given pursuant to applicable rules of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
the case may be).

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit the Change of Control Payment with the paying agent in respect of all Notes so accepted; and

S-56


-----

(3) deliver to the paying agent the Notes accepted and an officer’s certificate (with a copy to the trustee) stating the aggregate principal amount
of all Notes purchased by the Issuers.

The paying agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the paying
agent will promptly authenticate and mail, or cause to be transferred by book entry, to each holder a new Note in principal amount equal to any
unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations to the extent
those laws and regulations are applicable to any Change of Control Offer. If the provisions of any of the applicable securities laws or securities
regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described above, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and
will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the covenant described above by virtue of that compliance.

For so long as the Notes are admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and for trading on its Global Exchange Market and the rules of such
exchange so require, the Issuers will deliver notices relating to the Change of Control to Euronext Dublin through its online portal, Euronext Direct. A
third party, instead of the Issuers, may make the Change of Control Offer in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture and purchase all
Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn. In addition, the Issuers will not be obligated to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer with
respect to the Notes, if they have irrevocably elected (which election may be subject solely to the occurrence of the Change of Control Triggering Event)
to redeem all of the Notes under provisions described under “—Optional Redemption” and have not defaulted in their redemption obligations.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event, subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event. The
Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by
electronic transmission) as such Change of Control Triggering Event is consummated. The Issuers may rescind or amend the Change of Control Offer in
the event that the Issuers shall determine that the Change of Control Triggering Event will not occur by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the
Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed. A Change of Control Offer made in advance of the Change of Control Triggering Event may be made at
the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the indenture. The provisions under the indenture
relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or
modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

Some change of control events may constitute a default under the U.S. Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement or the U.K. Credit
Agreement. Future indebtedness of the Issuers or Guarantors may contain prohibitions on the events that constitute a Change of Control or Change of
Control Triggering Event. The U.S. Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement and the U.K. Credit Agreement require, and future indebtedness
may require, the indebtedness to be purchased or repaid if a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event occurs. Moreover, the exercise by
the holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or
Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not. Finally, the Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes, if required to do so, may be limited
by its then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering—We may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the Notes
upon a Change of Control Triggering Event”.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of
“all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Issuers and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Furthermore, this term has not
been interpreted under New York law (which is the governing law of the indenture) to represent a specific

quantitative test. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuers to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of Issuers and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be
uncertain.

**Limitation on Activities of Finco**

Finco may not hold any material assets, become liable for any material obligations, engage in any trade or business, or conduct any business
activity, other than (1) the issuance of its Capital Stock to Opco or any wholly owned Restricted Subsidiary of Opco, (2) the incurrence of Indebtedness
as a co-obligor or guarantor, as the case may be, of the Notes, the U.S. Credit Agreement, the Australian Credit Agreement, the U.K. Credit Agreement
and any other Indebtedness that is permitted to be incurred under the covenant described under the heading “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness;” provided that the net proceeds of such Indebtedness are not retained by Finco, and (3) activities incidental thereto. Neither the Parent nor
any Restricted Subsidiary shall engage in any transaction with Finco in violation of the immediately preceding sentence.

**Events of Default**

Events of Default under the indenture include the following:

(1) default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on any Note when they are due and payable at maturity, upon acceleration,
redemption or otherwise;

(2) default in the payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when it is due and payable, and such default continues for a
period of 30 days;

(3) the Issuers or Restricted Subsidiaries do not comply with their obligations under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale”;

(4) the Issuers fail to make or consummate a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control when required as described under “—
Certain Covenants—Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control and Rating Decline”;

(5) the Issuers or Restricted Subsidiaries default in the performance of or breach any other covenant or agreement of the Issuers or the
Restricted Subsidiaries in the indenture or under the Notes (other than a default specified in clause (1), (2), (3) or (4) above) and such
default or breach continues for 60 consecutive days (or, in the case of a failure to comply with the indenture provisions described under
“—Certain Covenants—SEC Reports and Reports to Holders”, 270 consecutive days), after written notice by the trustee or the holders of
25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the Notes; provided that any such notice may not be given with respect to any action taken,
and reported publicly or to holders, more than two years prior to such notice;

(6) there occurs with respect to any issue or issues of Indebtedness of an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary having an outstanding principal
amount of the greater of (x) $442.0 million and (y) 2.0% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, or more in the aggregate for all such issues of all such Persons, whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be
created:

(a) an event of default that has caused the holder thereof to declare such Indebtedness to be due and payable prior to its Stated Maturity
and such Indebtedness has not been Discharged in full or such acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled within 30 days of
such acceleration, and/or

(b) the failure to make a principal payment at the final (but not any interim) fixed maturity and such defaulted payment shall not have
been made, waived or extended within 30 days of such payment default;

S-58


-----

(7) any final and non-appealable judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of the greater of (x) $442.0 million and (y) 2.0% of
consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the aggregate for all such final judgments or orders
against all such Persons:

(a) shall be rendered against an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary and shall not be paid or discharged, and

(b) there shall be any period of 60 consecutive days following entry of the final judgment or order that causes the aggregate amount for
all such final judgments or orders outstanding and not paid or discharged against all such Persons to exceed the greater of (x)
$442.0 million and (y) 2.0% of consolidated Adjusted Total Assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries during which a stay
of enforcement of such final judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect;

(8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters a decree or order for:

(a) relief in respect of an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
other similar law now or hereafter in effect, (b) appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee custodian, trustee, sequestrator or
similar official of an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property and assets of an Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary, or

(b) the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary and, in each case, such decree or order shall
remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or

(9) an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary:

(a) commences a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consents
to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under such law,

(b) consents to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar
official of an Issuer or such Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property and assets of an Issuer or such
Significant Subsidiary, or

(c) effects any general assignment for the benefit of its creditors.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (6) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting
payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) under the indenture shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and
without any action by the Trustee or the holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an officer’s certificate to the
Trustee stating that (i) the Indebtedness or Guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (ii) holders thereof have rescinded
or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (iii) the default that is the basis for such Event
of Default has been cured.

Any payment in respect of a Note made in U.S. dollars to the extent permitted by the provisions described in “—Issuance in Euros” will not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Notes or the Indenture. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause
(8) or (9) above that occurs with respect to an Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the indenture, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Issuers and paying agent (and to the trustee and paying agent if such notice is
given by the holders), may, and the trustee at the request of the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding shall,
declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes to be immediately due and payable. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest shall be immediately due and payable. In

S-59


-----

the event of a declaration of acceleration because an Event of Default set forth in clause (6) above has occurred and is continuing, such declaration of
acceleration shall be automatically rescinded and annulled if the event of default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (6) shall be
remedied or cured by the relevant Issuer or Significant Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 60 days after the
declaration of acceleration with respect thereto.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (8) or (9) above occurs with respect to an Issuer, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest
on the Notes then outstanding shall automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
trustee or any holder.

For the avoidance of doubt, each indenture will provide that if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure
to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any
further action, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the indenture.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other
action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (each a “Directing Holder”) in accordance with the Indenture must be
accompanied by a written representation from each such holder delivered to the Issuers and the trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder
is the depositary (which initially will be DTC) or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a
“Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a
continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each
Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuers with such other information as the
Issuers may reasonably request from time-to-time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business
Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is the depositary or its nominee, any Position Representation or
Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the depositary or its nominee and the
depositary or its nominee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to
the trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers determine in good faith that there is a
reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the trustee an officer’s
certificate stating that the Issuers have initiated litigation (“Litigation”) in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing
Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default or Event of Default (or notice thereof) that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with
respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court
of competent jurisdiction on such matter (a “Final Decision”). Once such officer’s certificate has been provided to the Trustee, the Trustee shall take no
future action pursuant to the related Noteholder Direction until it receives notices of a Final Decision. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder
Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers provide to the trustee an officer’s certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy
its Verification Covenant (a “Verification Officer’s Certificate”), the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure
period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy
stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant, and the Trustee shall take no further action pursuant to the related Noteholder Direction until
the Issuers provide a subsequent officer’s certificate to the Trustee that such Verification Covenant has been satisfied (a “Covenant Satisfaction Officer’s
Certificate”). The Issuers shall promptly deliver a Covenant Satisfaction Officer’s Certificate following satisfaction by the applicable Directing Holder
of its Verification Covenant and then the trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such

S-60


-----

Noteholder Direction. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being
disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining holders that provided such Noteholder
Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect
that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and rescinded and the trustee shall be deemed not to have
received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default and shall not be permitted to act thereon. Notwithstanding the
above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of holders required under the indenture to give
such Noteholder Direction, the trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be
taken by the Issuers (as described above). Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered
to the trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the
foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in
accordance with the indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with
any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any officer’s certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or
determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall
have no liability for ceasing to take any action, staying any remedy or otherwise failing to act in accordance with a Noteholder Direction during the
pendency of any Litigation or a Noteholder Direction after a Verification Officer’s Certificate has been provided to it but prior to receipt of a Covenant
Satisfaction Officer’s Certificate. The trustee shall have no liability to the Issuers, any holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder
Direction. The trustee shall have no obligation to inquire if the Issuers will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position
Representation or monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith or to monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of
Default has been publicly reported. Each holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed to acknowledge and agree that the trustee (and any agent) shall not
be liable to any party for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any officer’s
certificate or Verification Officer’s Certificate described above or (iv) its duties under the indenture.

The holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuers and to the trustee, may waive all
past defaults and rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration and its consequences if:

(1) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on
the Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived, and

(2) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. As to the waiver of defaults, see “—
Modification and Waiver.”

The holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee. However, the trustee may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the indenture, that may involve the trustee in personal liability, or that the trustee determines in good faith may be
unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of Notes not joining in the giving of such direction and may take any other action it deems proper that is not
inconsistent with any such direction received from holders of Notes. A holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the Notes
unless:

(1) the holder gives the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;

(2) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes make a written request to the trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holder or holders offer the trustee indemnity satisfactory to the trustee against any costs, liability or expense;

S-61


-----

(4) the trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes do not give the trustee a
direction that is inconsistent with the request.

However, such limitations do not apply to the right of any holder of a Note to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on, such Note or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the due date expressed in the Notes,
which right shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the holder.

The indenture requires certain officers of the Issuers to deliver an officer’s certificate to the trustee, on or before a date not more than 120 days
after the end of each fiscal year, stating that a review has been conducted of the activities of the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries and of its
performance under the indenture during the previous fiscal year and that the Issuers and their Restricted Subsidiaries have fulfilled all obligations
thereunder during such period, or, if there has been a default in fulfillment of any such obligation during such period, specifying each such default and
the nature and status thereof. The Issuers will also be obligated to notify the trustee of any default or defaults in the performance of any covenants or
agreements under the indenture within 30 days of becoming aware of any such default unless such default has been cured before the end of the 30 day
period.

**Defeasance**

The Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have their obligations and the obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to the
outstanding Notes (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Events of Default. Legal Defeasance means that the Issuers and the Guarantors shall
be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the Notes and the Guarantees, and the indenture shall cease to be of
further effect as to all outstanding Notes and Guarantees, except as to:

(1) rights of holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of and interest (including Additional Amounts, if any) on the Notes when
such payments are due from the trust funds referred to below;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes, and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trust, duties, and immunities of the trustee, and the Issuers’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have their obligations and the obligations of the Guarantors released with
respect to most of the covenants under the indenture, except as described otherwise in the indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”), and thereafter any
omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default . In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain Events of Default (not
including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) will no longer apply. The Issuers may exercise their Legal
Defeasance option regardless of whether they previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the paying agent, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes subject to Legal Defeasance
or Covenant Defeasance, Euros, non-callable Euro-Denominated Designated Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such
amounts as will be sufficient (without reinvestment) to pay the principal of and interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if
any) on the Notes on the stated date for payment or on the redemption date of such Notes;

S-62


-----

provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of a Make-Whole Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for
purposes of the indenture governing such Notes to the extent that an amount is deposited with the paying agent equal to the applicable
Make-Whole Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such
amount, the “Make-Whole Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the paying agent on or prior to the date of redemption.
Any Make-Whole Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an officer’s certificate delivered to the paying agent at least one Business Day prior
to the deposit of such Make-Whole Premium Deficit that confirms that such Make-Whole Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such
redemption. For the avoidance of doubt, the trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any officer’s certificate delivered to it in
accordance with the indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any officer’s certificate, or verify any
statements in any officer’s certificate delivered to it. The trustee shall have no liability to the Issuers, any holder or any other Person in
acting in good faith on an officer’s certificate;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel in the United States confirming that:

(a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service, a ruling, or

(b) since the date of the indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that,
and based thereon this opinion of counsel shall confirm that, the holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of the Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel in the United States reasonably
acceptable to the trustee confirming that the holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if the Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to
be applied to such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens
on the deposited funds in connection therewith);

(5) the Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any other material
agreement or instrument (other than the indenture) to which the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound (other than any such Default or default relating to any Indebtedness being defeased from any borrowing of funds
to be applied to such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to such Indebtedness, and the granting of Liens on the
deposited funds in connection therewith);

(6) the Issuers shall have delivered to the trustee an officer’s certificate stating that the deposit was not made by them with the intent of
preferring the holders over any other of their creditors or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other of their
creditors or others; and

(7) the Issuers shall have delivered to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that the conditions provided for
in, in the case of the officer’s certificate, clauses (1) through (6) and, in the case of the opinion of counsel, clauses (2) and/ or (3) and (5) of
this paragraph have been complied with.

S-63

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights or registration of transfer or exchange of the
Notes, as expressly provided for in the indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when:

(1) either:

(a) all the Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid and
Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and thereafter
repaid to the Issuers or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the registrar for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the registrar for cancellation (1) have become due and payable or (2) will become due and
payable within one year, or are to be called for redemption within one year, under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the trustee
and paying agent for the giving of notice of redemption by the paying agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers, and the
Issuers have irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the paying agent funds in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the registrar for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on the Notes to the date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be, together with irrevocable instructions from
the Issuers directing the paying agent to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of a Make-Whole Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient
for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the paying agent equal to the applicable Make-Whole
Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, as calculated by the Issuers or on behalf of the Issuers by such Person
as the Issuers shall designate, with any Make-Whole Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the paying agent on or prior
to the date of redemption, and any Make-Whole Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an officer’s certificate delivered to the Trustee
and the paying agent at least one Business Day prior to the deposit of such Make-Whole Premium Deficit that confirms that such
Make-Whole Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) the Issuers have paid all other sums payable under the indenture by the Parent or the Issuers; and

(3) the Issuers have delivered to the trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions precedent under the
indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as to all outstanding Notes have been complied with.

**Modification and Waiver**

Subject to certain limited exceptions, modifications and amendments of the indenture may be made by the Issuers and the trustee with the consent
of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes; provided, however, that no such modification or
amendment may, without the consent of each holder affected thereby:

(1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest (or Additional Amounts, if any) on, any Note;

(2) reduce the principal amount of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any Note or make the Notes payable in money other than that stated in
the Note;

(3) change the place of payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any Note;

(4) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity (or, in the case of a redemption, on or
after the Redemption Date) of any Note;

S-64


-----

(5) reduce the above-stated percentages of outstanding Notes the consent of whose holders is necessary to modify or amend the indenture;

(6) waive a default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest (or Additional Amounts, if any) on the Notes (except a
rescission of the declaration of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, so long as all other existing Events of Default, other than the
nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest (or Additional Amounts, if any) on the Notes that have become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived);

(7) voluntarily release a Guarantor of the Notes, except as permitted by the indenture;

(8) reduce the percentage or aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes the consent of whose holders is necessary for waiver of
compliance with certain provisions of the indenture or for waiver of certain defaults; or

(9) modify or change any provisions of the indenture affecting the ranking of the Notes as to right of payment or the Guarantees thereof in
any manner adverse to the holders of the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder, the Parent, the Issuers, the Subsidiary Guarantors and trustee may amend the
indenture:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Parent, the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor under
the indenture;

(3) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(4) to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes or to secure the Notes;

(5) to add to the covenants of the Parent, the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Parent, the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder, as evidenced by an officer’s certificate delivered to the trustee
(upon which it may fully rely);

(7) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;

(8) to make any amendment to the provisions of the indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes; provided, however, that
(a) compliance with the indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other
applicable securities law and (b) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes;

(9) to conform the text of the indenture or the Guarantees or the Notes to any provision of this Description of Notes to the extent that such
provision in this Description of Notes was intended to be a substantially verbatim recitation of a provision of the indenture or the Guarantees or
the Notes, as evidenced by an officer’s certificate delivered to the trustee (upon which it may fully rely);

(10) evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee, provided that the successor trustee is otherwise qualified
and eligible to act as such under the terms of the indenture;

(11) provide for a reduction in the minimum denominations of the Notes;

(12) comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary; or

(13) to provide for the issuance of additional notes and related guarantees in accordance with the limitations set forth in the indenture.

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such
consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

S-65


-----

After an amendment under the indenture becomes effective, the Issuers are required to mail to holders a notice briefly describing such amendment.
However, the failure to give such notice to all holders, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

**No Personal Liability of Incorporators, Stockholders, Officers, Directors, or Employees**

The indenture provides that no recourse for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes or for any claim based
thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuers or the Guarantors in the
indenture, or in any of the Notes or Guarantees or because of the creation of any Indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator,
stockholder, officer, director, employee or controlling person of the Issuers or the Guarantors or of any successor Person thereof. Each holder, by
accepting the Notes, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**Book-Entry, Delivery and Form**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more global notes, in definitive, fully registered form, each of which we refer to as a “global note”.
Each such global note will be deposited with the common depositary for Clearstream and Euroclear (the “Common Depositary”), and registered in the
name of the Common Depositary or its nominee. We will not issue certificated securities to you for the Notes you purchase, except in the limited
circumstances described below.

Beneficial interests in the global notes will be represented, and transfers of such beneficial interest will be effected, through accounts of financial
institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct or indirect participants in Clearstream or Euroclear. Investors may hold Notes directly through
Clearstream or Euroclear, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. The address
of Clearstream is 42 Avenue JF Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg, and the address of Euroclear is 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II, B-1210
Brussels, Belgium.

Beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be made only through, records
maintained by Clearstream or Euroclear and their participants. When you purchase Notes through the Clearstream or Euroclear systems, the purchases
must be made by or through a direct or indirect participant in the Clearstream or Euroclear system, as the case may be. The participant will receive credit
for the Notes that you purchase on Clearstream’s or Euroclear’s records, and, upon its receipt of such credit, you will become the beneficial owner of
those Notes. Your ownership interest will be recorded only on the records of the direct or indirect participant in Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case
may be, through which you purchase the Notes and not on Clearstream’s or Euroclear’s records.

Neither Clearstream nor Euroclear, as the case may be, will have any knowledge of your beneficial ownership of the Notes. Clearstream’s or
Euroclear’s records will show only the identity of the direct participants and the amount of the Notes held by or through those direct participants.

You will not receive a written confirmation of your purchase or sale or any periodic account statement directly from Clearstream or Euroclear. You
should instead receive those documents from the direct or indirect participant in Clearstream or Euroclear through which you purchase the Notes.

As a result, the direct or indirect participants are responsible for keeping accurate account of the holdings of their customers. The paying agent
will wire payments on the Notes to the Common Depositary as the holder of the global notes. The trustee, the paying agent and we will treat the
Common Depositary or any successor nominee to the Common Depositary as the owner of the global notes for all purposes.

Accordingly, the trustee, the paying agent and we will have no direct responsibility or liability to pay amounts due with respect to the global notes
to you or any other beneficial owners in the global notes. Any

redemption or other notices with respect to the Notes will be sent by us or at our direction directly to Clearstream or Euroclear, which will, in turn,
inform the direct participants (or the indirect participants), which will then contact you as a beneficial holder, all in accordance with the rules of
Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be, and the internal procedures of the direct participant (or the indirect participant) through which you hold
your beneficial interest in the Notes.

**Initial Settlement**

Investors will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form. It is intended that Notes will be credited
to the securities custody accounts of Clearstream and Euroclear holders. None of the Notes may be held through, no trades of the Notes will be settled
through, and no payments with respect to the Notes will be made through, The Depository Trust Company in the United States of America.

**Clearstream and Euroclear**

We have obtained the information in this section concerning Clearstream and Euroclear, and the book-entry system and procedures from sources
that we believe to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for the accuracy of this information. In addition, the description of the clearing systems in
this section reflects our understanding of the rules and procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear as they are currently in effect. Those clearing systems
could change their rules and procedures at any time.

Clearstream has advised that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its
participating organizations and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream participants through electronic
book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to
Clearstream participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and
securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Clearstream is registered as a bank in Luxembourg,
and as such is subject to regulation by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. Clearstream participants are recognized financial
institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other
organizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Clearstream is available to other institutions that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Clearstream participant.

Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream
participants in accordance with its rules and procedures.

Euroclear advises that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear
participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates
and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear provides various other services, including securities lending and
borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank SA/NV (the “Euroclear Operator”) under
contract with Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C., a Belgian cooperative corporation (the “Cooperative”). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear
Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator, not the Cooperative.
The Cooperative establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear participants. Euroclear participants include banks, securities brokers and dealers
and other professional financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.

The Euroclear Operator is regulated and examined by the Belgian Banking and Finance Commission. Securities clearance accounts and cash
accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and

S-67


-----

Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System, and applicable Belgian law. These Terms and
Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments with
respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities
clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear participants, and has no record of or
relationship with persons holding through Euroclear participants.

Under Belgian law, the Euroclear Operator is required to pass on the benefits of ownership in any interests in securities on deposit with it, such as
interest, consent rights and other entitlements, to any person credited with such interests in securities on its records.

Distributions with respect to interests in the Notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear
Participants in accordance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions.

**Secondary Market Trading**

Any secondary market trading of book-entry interests in the Notes will take place through participants in Clearstream and Euroclear in accordance
with the normal rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear and will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional
eurobonds in same-day funds. Owners of book-entry interests in the Notes will receive payments relating to their Notes in euros.

Clearstream or Euroclear will credit payments to the cash accounts of Clearstream customers or Euroclear participants, as applicable, in
accordance with the relevant system’s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Clearstream or the Euroclear Operator, as the case
may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the indenture on behalf of a Clearstream customer or Euroclear participant
only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures.

You should be aware that investors will be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving the Notes through
Clearstream and Euroclear only on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks,
brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Clearstream and Euroclear on the
same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of
the Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on
whether Clearstream or Euroclear is used.

Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the Notes among participants of Clearstream
and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at
any time.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The indenture provides that, except during the continuance of a Default, the trustee will not be liable, except for the performance of such duties as
are specifically set forth in the indenture. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the trustee will use the same degree of care and skill in
its exercise of the rights and powers vested in it under the indenture as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of such
person’s own affairs.

The indenture and provisions of the Trust Indenture Act incorporated by reference into the indenture contain limitations on the rights of the
trustee, should it become a creditor of an Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in

S-68


-----

certain cases or to realize on certain property received by it in respect of any such claims, as security or otherwise. The trustee is permitted to engage in
other transactions; provided, however, that if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict or resign.

**Notices**

All notices to the holders of the Notes regarding the Notes will be mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Notes and will
be deemed to have been given on the fourth Business Day after the date of mailing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Notes are represented by global notes and such global notes are held on behalf of Euroclear and
Clearstream, notices to the holders of such Notes may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and Clearstream for communication by it
to entitled accountholders.

In addition, for so long as the Notes are admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and for trading on its Global Exchange Market and the
rules of such exchange so require, the Issuers will deliver notices to the holders of such Notes to Euronext Dublin through its online portal, Euronext
Direct.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuers for payment of principal, premium or Additional Amounts (if any) on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the
applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer for payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable
due date for payment of interest.

**Listing**

The indenture will provide that the Issuers will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the first interest payment date on the
Notes and maintain the admission of the Notes to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and for trading on its Global Market Exchange for so long as such
Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuers determine that they will not maintain such listing, they will obtain prior to the delisting of
the Notes from Euronext Dublin, and thereafter use their commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on another internationally
recognized stock exchange. The Issuers will notify the trustee and paying agent of the listing of any Notes on an exchange.

Application will be made for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to trading on its Global Exchange Market. There
can be no assurance that the application to admit the Notes to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to trading on its Global Exchange Market will be
approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

which serves to, extend, refinance, renew, replace, defease, discharge or refund other Indebtedness of an Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than intercompany Indebtedness); provided that:

(1) the principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount
(or accreted value, if applicable) of the Indebtedness so extended, refinanced, renewed, replaced, defeased, discharged or refunded (plus all

defeased, discharged or refunded or (y) the date that is 91 days after the maturity of the Notes, and

(3) if the Indebtedness being extended, refinanced, renewed, replaced, defeased, discharged or refunded is contractually subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantee, such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

See “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the accompanying prospectus for a summary of the current material federal income tax
consequences to MPT and the Operating Partnership generally resulting from the treatment of MPT as a REIT.

**Taxation of Noteholders**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of the Notes for “U.S.
Holders” or “Non-U.S. Holders” (each, as defined below and collectively, “Holders”). Except where noted, this summary deals only with Notes held as
capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code), by a Holder who purchases the Notes for cash at their original “issue price” within the
meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes are sold to the public). This discussion does
not address the tax consequences to subsequent purchasers of Notes.

This discussion does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a Holder in light of its particular
circumstances or the considerations applicable to Holders that are subject to special rules, including, without limitation, dealers in securities or
currencies, financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, tax-deferred
or other retirement accounts, persons that hold the Notes as part of a “hedging,” “integrated” or “conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle”
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, former citizens or residents of the United States, pass-through entities (e.g., S corporations, partnerships or other
entities taxable as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), “controlled foreign corporations”, “passive foreign investment companies”, and
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This summary also does not deal with a Holder who holds a Note with amortizable bond
premium (which generally arises if the Holder’s tax basis in the Note exceeds its stated redemption price at maturity, as defined below), who has made
an election under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1272-3(a) to accrue interest on the Notes using the constant yield method, or who is required to
accelerate any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an “applicable financial statement” within the meaning of
Section 451(b) of the Code. Furthermore, this summary does not consider the effect of the U.S. federal estate or gift tax laws, state, local, or non-U.S.
income tax laws, the application of any income tax treaty or any U.S. federal alternative minimum tax considerations.

The U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below are based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, court decisions, and rulings and pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) all as in effect on the date
hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and to differing interpretations, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax
considerations different from those summarized below. We have not sought any ruling from the IRS with respect to statements made and conclusions
reached in this summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions.

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the

United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have

the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or if the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be
treated as a U.S. person.

S-91


-----

As used herein, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is a non-resident alien individual or a foreign corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and that is not otherwise subject to special treatment under the Code.

If a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of a Note, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership
considering an investment in the Notes and partners in such a partnership are urged to consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

Investors considering the purchase of the Notes are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income
tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under the laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

**_U.S. Holders_**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to a U.S. Holder.

_Effect of additional interest_

We may be required to pay additional interest on a Note in certain circumstances described above, e.g., under the headings “—Additional
Amounts”, “—Redemption for Changes in Taxes” and “—Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control and Ratings Decline”. Further, we may also
be required to make payments on a Note in U.S. dollars in certain circumstances described above, e.g., under the headings “Description of Notes—
Issuance in Euros”. Because we believe the likelihood that we will be obligated to either make any such additional payment on the Notes or make
payments on the Notes in U.S. dollars is remote, we are taking the position (and this discussion assumes) that the Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, a U.S. Holder generally would be required to accrue ordinary income
on its Notes in excess of stated interest, regardless of the U.S. holder’s method of accounting, and to treat any gain realized on the taxable disposition of
a Note as ordinary income rather than capital gain. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes are not treated as contingent payment debt
instruments.

_Stated interest_

Except as set forth below, stated interest on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income from domestic sources at the time
such interest is paid or accrued in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for tax purposes.

We expect, and the remainder of this discussion assumes (except to the limited extent specifically noted), that the Notes will not be treated as
being issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If a U.S. Holder uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and receives a payment of stated interest on a Note in
euros the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (determined at the spot rate on the date
such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash method U.S. Holder will not recognize
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros
so received. Such gain or loss will generally constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

S-92


-----

If a U.S. Holder uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and receives a payment of stated interest on a Note in
euros, the U.S. Holder will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in euros that has accrued with respect
to the Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will be determined by translating such income at the average rate of
exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that is partially within two different taxable years, at the average rate for the partial
period within each taxable year. A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income using the rate of exchange on the last day
of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that is partially within two different taxable years, using as the applicable rate of exchange for
the portion of the accrual period that falls in the first taxable year the rate of exchange on the last day of such taxable year. This election will apply to
other obligations held by the U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. If the last day of an accrual period is within five
business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. Holder may translate such interest using the rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A
U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to
accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between
the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (determined on the date such payment is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S.
dollar value of interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above). Such gain or loss will generally constitute U.S. source
ordinary income or loss.

_Sale, redemption, exchange or other taxable disposition of Notes_

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or
loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the disposition (i.e., the amount of U.S. dollar cash proceeds and the fair market value of
euros or other property received on the disposition (except to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which is
taxable as ordinary income if not previously included in such Holder’s income) and (ii) such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. Subject to the
foreign currency rules described below, any gain or loss recognized on a disposition of a Note by a U.S. Holder will be U.S. source capital gain or loss,
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more
than one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally be subject to taxation at a reduced rate. A U.S. Holder’s
ability to deduct capital losses may be limited.

A U.S. Holder that receives euros or other foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition, will generally calculate the
amount realized relating to such disposition based on the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date the instrument is disposed of (or deemed
disposed of). In the case of a Note that is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S.
Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition.
No assurance can be given regarding whether the Notes will be traded on an established securities market. If an accrual basis U.S. Holder does not make
this election, and the Note is disposed of, or deemed to be disposed of, the U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amount realized
by translating that amount at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition and generally will recognize exchange gain
or loss (generally treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amount
realized based on the spot rates in effect on the date of disposition and the settlement date.

The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market,
which is discussed in the preceding paragraph, must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the U.S. dollar amount the U.S. Holder paid for the Note. If a U.S. Holder uses
foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase.
The conversion of U.S. dollars to a

S-93


-----

foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will generally not result in exchange gain or loss for a U.S. Holder.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and will generally be treated as U.S. source income or an offset to U.S. source income, respectively. Gain
or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates generally will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the
Note, determined on the date such payment is received or such Note is disposed of, and the U.S. dollar value of the euro principal amount of the Note,
determined on the date the U.S. Holder acquired such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of a Note a U.S.
Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received in respect of accrued and unpaid interest. Any such exchange gain or loss
with respect to accrued but unpaid interest will be determined as discussed under “U.S. Holders—Stated interest”. However, upon a sale, exchange,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and accrued but unpaid
interest only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the disposition.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the rules regarding foreign currency gains and losses in respect of
their investment in the Notes.

_Information reporting and backup withholding_

We will report to our U.S. Holders and to the IRS the amount of interest payments, and payments of the proceeds from the sale, exchange,
redemption, repurchase, retirement or other disposition of a Note made to a U.S. Holder, and the amount we withhold, if any. Under the backup
withholding rules, a U.S. Holder may be subject to backup withholding at a current rate of up to 24% with respect to such amounts unless the Holder:

    - comes within certain exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates that fact, or

    - provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding, and otherwise complies with the

applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

A U.S. Holder who does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the U.S. Holder’s income tax liability if
the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

_Medicare Tax_

U.S. Holders that are individuals are currently subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) the U.S. Holder’s “net investment income” for the relevant
taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. Holder’s modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (which currently is
between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s circumstances). Estates and trusts that do not fall into a special class of trusts that is
exempt from such tax are subject to the same 3.8% tax on the lesser of their undistributed net investment income and the excess of their adjusted gross
income over a certain threshold. Net investment income generally includes interest on our Notes and gain from the sale of our Notes. U.S. Holders that
are individuals, estates or trusts are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of this tax to their income and gains in respect of their
investment in the Notes.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

The rules governing the U.S. federal income taxation of a Non-U.S. Holder are complex and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than
a general summary of such rules. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the effect of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax
laws, as well as tax treaties, with regard to an investment in the Notes.

S-94


-----

_Interest_

A Non-U.S. Holder holding the Notes on its own behalf generally will be exempt from U.S. federal income and withholding taxes on payments of
interest on a Note (which for purposes of this discussion of Non-U.S. Holders includes any OID on a Note) that is not effectively connected with the
conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the Non-U.S. Holder unless (i) such Non-U.S. Holder is a direct or indirect 10% or greater partner
(as defined in section 871(h)(3) of the Code) in the Operating Partnership, (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder is a controlled foreign corporation related to the
Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, (iii) such Non-U.S. Holder is a bank extending credit pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the
ordinary course of its trade or business, or (iv) withholding is required under FATCA (discussed below).

In order for a Non-U.S. Holder to qualify for this exemption from taxation and withholding on interest, the “withholding agent” (generally, the last
U.S. payor or a non-U.S. payor who is a qualified intermediary or withholding foreign partnership) must have received a statement (generally made on
the relevant IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E) from the Non-U.S. Holder that: (i) is signed under penalties of perjury by the beneficial
owner of the Note, (ii) certifies that such owner is a Non-U.S. Holder and (iii) provides the beneficial owner’s name and address.

To the extent that interest income with respect to a Note is not exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax as described above, a Non-U.S. Holder
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax currently imposed at a 30% rate unless (1) such tax is eliminated or reduced under an applicable income tax
treaty and the Non-U.S. Holder complies with the applicable certification requirements (generally, by providing a properly completed IRS Form
W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E) or (2) such interest income is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base within the United States)
and the Non-U.S. Holder establishes that such interest is not subject to withholding (generally, by providing an IRS Form W-8ECI).

_Sale, redemption, exchange or other taxable disposition of Notes_

Any gain realized on the sale, redemption, exchange, retirement, repurchase or other taxable disposition of a Note by a Non-U.S. Holder (except
to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which would be taxable as described above) will generally be exempt from U.S.
federal income and withholding taxes so long as: (i) the gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by
the Non-U.S. Holder (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so provides, is not attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base within the
United States) and (ii) in the case of a foreign individual, the Non-U.S. Holder is not present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable
year in which the gain is realized and certain other requirements are met.

_Effectively connected income_

A Non-U.S. Holder whose gain or interest income with respect to a Note is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the
United States by such Non-U.S. Holder (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so provides, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed
base within the United States) will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain or interest income at regular U.S. federal income tax rates
on a net basis, as if the Holder were a U.S. person. In addition, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits tax
equal to 30% of its “dividend equivalent amount” within the meaning of the Code for the taxable year, subject to adjustment, unless it qualifies for a
lower rate or an exemption under an applicable tax treaty. The withholding tax discussed above will not apply to effectively connected income, provided
the Holder furnishes an IRS Form W-8ECI or the relevant IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable.

_Information reporting and backup withholding_

Information reporting requirements and backup withholding generally will not apply to interest payments on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder if the
statement described in “Non-U.S. Holders—Interest” is duly provided by such Holder, provided that the withholding agent does not have actual
knowledge that the Holder is a United States person. Information reporting requirements and backup withholding will not apply to any payment of the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a redemption) of a Note effected outside the United States by a foreign office of a “broker” (as
defined in applicable Treasury regulations), unless such broker (i) is a United States person, (ii) derives 50% or more of its gross income for certain
periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (iii) is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of the Code, (iv) is a
U.S. branch of a foreign bank or a foreign insurance company, or (v) is a partnership with a U.S. trade or business or a specified percentage of U.S.
partners. Payment of the proceeds of any such disposition effected outside the United States by a foreign office of any broker that is described in
(ii) through (v) of the preceding sentence will not be subject to backup withholding, but will be subject to the information reporting requirements unless
such broker has documentary evidence in its records that the beneficial owner is a Non-U.S. person and certain other conditions are met, or the
beneficial owner otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment of the proceeds of any such disposition or through the United States office of a broker is
subject to information reporting and backup withholding requirements, unless the beneficial owner of the debt security provides the statement described
in “Non-U.S. Holders—Interest” or otherwise establishes an exemption. Any amount withheld from a payment to a Holder of a Note under the backup
withholding rules is allowable as a credit against such Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (which might entitle such Holder to a refund), provided
that such Holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.

_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder (which are commonly referred to as “FATCA”),
together with administrative guidance and certain intergovernmental agreements entered into thereunder, generally impose withholding taxes on certain
types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other non-U.S. entities unless additional certification, information reporting and
other specified requirements are satisfied. Failure to comply with the FATCA reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership
by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) could result in withholding tax, at a rate of 30%, being imposed on payments of interest
and sales proceeds to foreign intermediaries and certain Non-U.S. Holders. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an
applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Compliance with these requirements generally is certified to a withholding agent by
providing an applicable IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E. Currently proposed regulations provide that FATCA withholding does not apply to gross
proceeds from the disposition of property of a type that can produce US source interest or dividends, such as interest on the Notes; however, prior
versions of the rules would have made such gross proceeds subject to FATCA withholding. Taxpayers (including withholding agents) can currently rely
on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. We will not pay any additional amounts to non-U.S. holders in respect of any amounts
withheld. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules on their investment in the Notes.

**CERTAIN UNITED KINGDOM TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a general, non-exhaustive summary regarding certain aspects relevant to the United Kingdom tax position of persons beneficially
owning the Notes. Particular rules may apply to certain classes of taxpayers holding the Notes (such as dealers and persons connected with us). The
summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are of a general nature only and may be subject to change in the future,
possibly with retrospective effect. The following only covers those matters specifically referred to below. Holders of the Notes should be aware that the
tax legislation of any jurisdiction where a holder is resident or otherwise subject to taxation (as well as the jurisdictions mentioned herein) may have an
impact on the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes including in respect of any income received from the Notes. Prospective investors in the
Notes should consult their professional advisers on the tax implications of the holding, redemption or sale of the Notes and the receipt of interest thereon
under the laws of their country of residence, citizenship or domicile.

The summary is based on current United Kingdom tax law and the published practice of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) which
may not be binding on HMRC and may be subject to change, sometimes with retrospective effect.

**United Kingdom Withholding Tax**

_Payments by the Issuers_

Provided that the interest on the Notes does not have a United Kingdom source, interest on the Notes may be paid by the Issuers without
withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax. The location of the source of a payment is a complex matter. It is necessary
to have regard to case law and HMRC practice. Case law has established that in determining the source of interest, all relevant factors must be taken into
account. HMRC has indicated that it considers the most important factors in determining the source of a payment are those which influence where a
creditor would sue for payment, and has stated that the place where the Issuer does business, and the place where its assets are located, are some of the
most important factors in this regard; however, HMRC has also indicated that, depending on the circumstances, other relevant factors may include the
place where the interest and principal are payable, the method of payment, the governing law of the Notes and the competent jurisdiction for any legal
action, the location of any security for the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, and similar factors relating to any guarantee. Based on an assessment of
relevant factors, the Company does not believe that interest should have a United Kingdom source.

In the event that any interest which has a United Kingdom source, it should be possible for such interest to be paid by the Issuers without
withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax provided that the Notes are and continue to be listed on a “recognised stock
exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) for the purposes of section 987 of the Act or admitted to trading on
a “multilateral trading facility” operated by a European Economic Area or United Kingdom regulated recognised stock exchange (within the meaning of
section 987 of the Act). The Irish Stock Exchange (“Euronext Dublin”) is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. Securities such as the Notes
will be treated as listed on the Euronext Dublin if they are included in the Official List of the Euronext Dublin and are admitted to trading on the
Euronext Dublin.

In all cases falling outside the above exemption and where interest has a United Kingdom source, interest on the Notes may fall to be paid under
deduction of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%).

Where interest has been paid under deduction of United Kingdom income tax, holders who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be able to
recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate provision in any applicable double taxation treaty.

S-97


-----

Where the Notes are issued at an issue price of less than 100 per cent of their principal amount, any discount element on any such Notes will not
generally be subject to any United Kingdom withholding tax (even should such discount element be considered to have a United Kingdom source on the
basis of the above considerations).

Where the Notes are to be, or may fall to be, redeemed at a premium, as opposed to being issued at a discount, then any such element of premium
may constitute a payment of interest. Payments of interest are subject to United Kingdom withholding tax as outlined above.

References to “interest” above mean “interest” as understood in United Kingdom tax law. The statements above do not take any account of any
different definitions of “interest” or “principal” which may prevail under any other law.

The attention of prospective investors in Notes is brought to the section headed “Description of Notes—Additional Amounts” which sets out the
basis on which the Issuer may be required to pay Additional Amounts in respect of deductions or withholdings, including deductions or withholdings for
or on account of United Kingdom tax.

_Payments under the Guarantee_

If the Guarantor makes payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts
subscribed for the Notes) and such payments have a United Kingdom source, such payments may be subject to United Kingdom withholding tax at the
basic rate (currently 20%) subject to such relief or exemption as may be available. Whether such payments made by the Guarantor have a United
Kingdom source is a complex matter and is likely to be determined by reference principally to the factors set out above. Such payments made by the
Guarantor may not be eligible for the exemption described above in respect of the Notes being listed on a recognized stock exchange.

**CERTAIN EUROPEAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**European Union Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (as Amended) and Proposed Financial Transactions Tax**

_EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (as amended)_

On May 25, 2018, the European Union adopted Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 amending European Council Directive 2011/16/EU on
administrative cooperation in the field of taxation that imposes a reporting obligation on parties involved in cross-border transactions that may be
associated with tax planning (“DAC 6”).

DAC 6 requires the mandatory and automatic exchange of information regarding cross-border arrangements within its scope. The reporting
obligation applies to cross-border arrangements that satisfy one or more “hallmarks” provided for in DAC 6 (the “Reportable Arrangements”). In the
case of a Reportable Arrangement, the information that must be reported generally includes the name of all relevant taxpayers and intermediaries as well
as an outline of the Reportable Arrangement, the value of the Reportable Arrangement and identification of any EU Member States, which is likely to be
concerned by the Reportable Arrangement.

DAC 6 imposes requirements on intermediaries (including, but not limited to, tax advisors, accountants, lawyers, banks and financial advisors and
certain persons who provide aid, assistance or advice in relation to such cross-border arrangements) to report information on Reportable Arrangements
to tax authorities. In certain circumstances (including, but not limited to, the relevant intermediary being located outside of the European Union or
bound by legal professional privilege) the obligation to disclose could pass to the taxpayer itself.

As a result of DAC 6, the Company or its advisors or intermediaries may be required to disclose information to European Union or United
Kingdom tax authorities regarding Reportable Arrangements in which the Company is involved. We may not be aware of all disclosures made pursuant
to DAC 6 regarding transactions to which the group is a party.

Similar reporting regime to DAC 6 has also been implemented outside of the EU and the United Kingdom implemented a limited version of DAC
6 with a view to amend the regime within a year. The United States has not to date committed to implement a reporting regime similar to DAC 6.

_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (“FTT”)_

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive for a common FTT in
Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “participating Member States”).

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market
transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of the Notes should, however, be exempt. Under the Commission’s Proposal the
FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain
dealings in the notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial
institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting
with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a
participating Member State.

On March 16, 2016, Estonia formally withdrew from enhanced cooperation on FTT leaving ten remaining participating Member States. On
December 11, 2019, Germany issued a revised proposal for the FTT to the remaining participating Member States. The FTT proposal (including whether
or not it comes into force as proposed or at all) remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and the scope of any

S-99


-----

such tax is uncertain. In an Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) report to the European Council dated December 5, 2019 it was noted that
agreement among the participating Member States would represent a first step in the legislative process and that an inclusive and substantial debate
between all EU Member States would need to take place at the European Council. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of, and investors in, the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**UNDERWRITING**

Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities, and Merrill Lynch International LLC are acting as representatives of
each of the underwriters named below. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in an underwriting agreement among us and the underwriters, we
have agreed to sell to the underwriters, and each of the underwriters has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, the principal amount of
Notes set forth opposite its name below.

**Principal**

**Underwriter** **Amount of Notes**

Barclays Bank PLC
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
Merrill Lynch International

Total £

To the extent any underwriter that is not a U.S.-registered broker-dealer intends to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so
through one or more U.S.-registered broker-dealers in accordance with applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the underwriting agreement, the underwriters have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all
of the Notes sold under the underwriting agreement if any of the Notes are purchased. If an underwriter defaults, the underwriting agreement provides
that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting underwriters may be increased or the underwriting agreement may be terminated.

We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to
payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The underwriters are offering the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to certain conditions
contained in the underwriting agreement, such as the receipt by the underwriters of officer’s certificates and legal opinions. The underwriters reserve the
right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The underwriters will purchase each series of Notes at the applicable discount from the offering price indicated on the cover of this prospectus
supplement. The representatives have advised us that the underwriters propose initially to offer the Notes of each series to the public at the public
offering price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus supplement and may offer some of the Notes to dealers at that price less a concession not to
exceed % of the Notes. The underwriters may allow, and dealers may reallow, on sales to other dealers, a concession not to exceed % of the principal
amount of the Notes. After the initial offering, the public offering price, concession or any other term of the offering may be changed.

The expenses of the offering, not including the underwriting discount, are estimated at approximately $         million and are payable by us.

**New Issue of Notes**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We intend to apply to have the Notes admitted to the Official List of
Euronext Dublin and traded on its Global Exchange Market. We have been

S-101


-----

advised by the underwriters that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no
obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading
market for the Notes or that an active public market for the Notes will develop. If an active public trading market for the Notes does not develop, the
market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price,
depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions
and other factors.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about, 2021, which will be the U.S. business day following the date of this
prospectus supplement (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are
required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes
prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+, to
specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the
Notes during such period should consult their advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period beginning on the date of the underwriting agreement and ending on the date that this offering closes,
without the prior consent of the representatives, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or
otherwise dispose of, any debt securities or securities exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, except for the Notes sold to the underwriters
pursuant to the underwriting agreement.

**Stabilization**

In connection with this issue, Barclays Bank PLC (the “Stabilizing Manager”) (or persons acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) for its
account may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and directives, over-allot or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the
Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on behalf
of the Stabilizing Manager) will undertake any stabilizing action. Any stabilizing action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public
disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Notes takes place and, if begun, may be discontinued at any time, but must end no later than the earlier of 30
days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. Any stabilization action or over-allotment must be
conducted by the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

**Electronic Distribution**

A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the Internet sites or through other online services maintained by one or more of the
underwriters and/or selling group members participating in this offering, or by their affiliates. In those cases, prospective investors may view offering
terms online and, depending upon the particular underwriter or selling group member, prospective investors may be allowed to place orders online. The
underwriters may agree with us to allocate a specific number of Notes for sale to online brokerage account holders. Any such allocation for online
distributions will be made by the representatives on the same basis as other allocations.

Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on any underwriter’s or selling group member’s web site and any information
contained in any other web site maintained by an underwriter or selling

S-102


-----

group member is not part of the prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, has not been approved and/or endorsed by
us or any underwriter or selling group member in its capacity as underwriter or selling group member and should not be relied upon by investors.

**Other Relationships**

The underwriters and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities
trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing
and brokerage activities. The underwriters and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various
commercial and investment banking and financial advisory services for the issuer and its affiliates, for which they received or may in the future receive
customary fees and expenses. Certain of the underwriters or their affiliates may hold 2022 Notes and may receive proceeds from this offering through
the redemption of the 2022 Notes. Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility portion of our U.S. Credit
Agreement. To the extent we use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility
portion of our U.S. Credit Agreement, such affiliates will receive their proportionate share of any amounts repaid (see “Use of Proceeds”).

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and certain of their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own
account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the issuer or
its affiliates. If the underwriters or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those underwriters or their affiliates routinely hedge, and
certain other of those underwriters or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities or the securities of our affiliates, including potentially the shares of common stock
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the shares of common stock offered
hereby. The underwriters and certain of their affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be_
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has
been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Hong Kong**

The Notes have not been offered or sold and will not be offered or sold in Hong Kong, by means of any document, other than (a) to “professional
investors” as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) of Hong Kong and any rules made under that Ordinance; or (b) in other
circumstances which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” as defined in the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32) of Hong Kong or which do
not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of that Ordinance. No advertisement, invitation or document relating to the Notes has been or
may be issued or has been or may be in the possession of any person for the purposes of issue, whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere, which is directed at,
or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public of Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the securities laws of Hong
Kong) other than with respect to Notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional
investors” as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance and any rules made under that Ordinance.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Switzerland**

This prospectus supplement does not constitute an issue prospectus pursuant to Article 652a or Article 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations and
the Notes will not be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Therefore, this

S-104


-----

prospectus supplement may not comply with the disclosure standards of the listing rules (including any additional listing rules or prospectus schemes) of
the SIX Swiss Exchange. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered to the public in or from Switzerland, but only to a selected and limited circle of
investors who do not subscribe to the Notes with a view to distribution. Any such investors will be individually approached by the underwriters from
time to time.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be_
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United
Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Each underwriter has represented and agreed that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or
sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers and MPT; and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in,

**ABOUT MEDICAL PROPERTIES TRUST, INC. AND MPT OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P.**

Medical Properties is a self-advised, NYSE-listed REIT focused on investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities across the United
States and selectively in foreign jurisdictions. Medical Properties has operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004. We conduct substantially all of our
business through the Operating Partnership. We acquire and develop healthcare facilities and lease the facilities to healthcare operating companies under
long-term net leases, which require the tenant to bear most of the costs associated with the property. We also make mortgage loans to healthcare
operators collateralized by their real estate assets. In addition, we selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable REIT
subsidiaries, the proceeds of which are typically used for acquisition and working capital. From time to time, we may also acquire a profit or other
equity interest in certain of our tenants that gives us a right to share in such tenants’ profits and losses.

Medical Properties was incorporated under Maryland law on August 27, 2003, and the Operating Partnership was formed under Delaware law on
September 10, 2003. Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Urban Center Drive, Suite 501, Birmingham, Alabama 35242. Our telephone
number is (205) 969-3755. Our Internet address is www.medicalpropertiestrust.com. The information found on, or otherwise accessible through, our
website is not incorporated into, and does not form a part of, this prospectus or any other report or document we file with or furnish to the SEC.

**ABOUT MPT FINANCE CORPORATION**

MPT Finance Corp. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. MPT Finance Corp. has no assets and does not and will not
conduct any operations or have any employees. It was formed for the sole purpose of acting as an issuer or co-issuer of debt securities that the Operating
Partnership may issue from time to time solely to allow certain institutional investors that might otherwise not be able to invest in our securities, either
because the Operating Partnership is a limited partnership, or by reason of the legal investment laws of their states of organization or their charters, to
invest in such debt securities.

**DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES AND RELATED GUARANTEES**

This prospectus contains a summary of the securities that we may sell pursuant to this prospectus. This summary is not meant to be a complete
description of each security. However, this prospectus, together with any applicable accompanying prospectus supplement, will contain the material
terms of the securities being offered. When used in this section, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “Issuers” refer jointly to the Operating Partnership and
MPT Finance Corp., and the term “Parent” refers only to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and not to any of its subsidiaries.

**_General_**

The Operating Partnership may issue senior debt securities in one or more series, and MPT Finance Corp. is expected to be a co-issuer of any such
series. MPT Finance Corp. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. MPT Finance Corp. has no assets and does not and will not
conduct any operations or have any employees. It was formed for the sole purpose of acting as an issuer or co-obligor of debt securities that the
Operating Partnership may issue from time to time.

If we offer debt securities covered by this registration statement, we will issue them under a base indenture, dated as of October 10, 2013, by and
among the Issuers, the Parent, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association,
as trustee, which will be amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture to create the form and terms of each series of debt securities that may
be issued, offered and sold hereunder. The base indenture is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and any
supplemental indenture will be filed as an exhibit to a document incorporated by reference herein, in connection with the issuance of any new series of
debt securities offered and sold hereunder. We refer to the base indenture, as amended and supplemented by each supplemental indenture applicable to a
series of debt securities issued thereunder and offered hereby, as an “indenture”. We urge you to read the base indenture and relevant supplemental
indenture because these documents, and not the summary below, will define your rights as a holder of debt securities. Capitalized terms used in the
summary have the meanings specified in the indenture.

**Specific Terms of Each Series of Debt Securities in the Prospectus Supplement**

A prospectus supplement and a supplemental indenture relating to any series of debt securities being offered will include specific terms relating to
the offering. These terms will include some or all of the following:

    - whether MPT Finance Corp. will be a co-issuer;

    - the guarantors of the debt securities, if any;

    - the title of the debt securities;

    - the total principal amount of the debt securities;

    - the assets, if any, that are pledged as security for the payment of the debt securities;

    - whether we will issue the debt securities in individual certificates to each holder in registered form, or in the form of temporary or

permanent global securities held by a depository on behalf of holders;

    - the prices at which we will issue the debt securities;

    - the portion of the principal amount that will be payable if the maturity of the debt securities is accelerated;

    - the currency or currency unit in which the debt securities will be payable, if not U.S. dollars;

    - the dates on which the principal of the debt securities will be payable;

    - the interest rate that the debt securities will bear and the interest payment dates for the debt securities;

    - any optional redemption provisions;

    - any sinking fund or other provisions that would obligate us to repurchase or otherwise redeem the debt securities;

    - any changes to or additional events of default or covenants; and

    - any other terms of the debt securities.

We may offer and sell debt securities, including original issue discount debt securities, at a substantial discount below their principal amount. The
prospectus supplement will describe special U.S. federal income tax and any other considerations applicable to those securities. In addition, the
prospectus supplement may describe certain special U.S. federal income tax or other considerations applicable to any debt securities that are
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars.

**_Guarantees_**

To the extent specified in the prospectus supplement relating to a series of debt securities, Parent may guarantee to each holder and the Trustee, on
a joint and several basis, the full and prompt payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the debt securities of that series when and as the
same become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, upon redemption or repurchase, by declaration of acceleration or otherwise. If a series of debt
securities is guaranteed, such series may be guaranteed by Parent and, to the extent specified in the prospectus supplement relating to a series of debt
securities and if one or more specified contingencies occurs after issuance of such debt securities, by some or all of Parent’s subsidiaries. The prospectus
supplement will describe any limitation on the maximum amount of any particular guarantee and the conditions under which guarantees may be
released. The guarantees will be general obligations of the Parent and any such subsidiaries.

**_Consolidation, Merger or Asset Sale_**

Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement respecting a series of debt securities, each indenture will, in general, allow us to
consolidate or merge with or into another entity. It will also allow each Issuer to sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
assets to another entity. If this happens, the remaining or acquiring entity must assume all of such Issuer’s responsibilities and liabilities under the
indenture including the payment of all amounts due on the debt securities and performance of such Issuer’s covenants in the indenture.

**_No Protection in the Event of a Change of Control_**

Unless otherwise set forth in the prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not contain any provisions that protect the holders of the debt
securities in the event of a change of control of us or in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, whether or not such transaction results in a change of
control of us.

**_Modification of Indentures_**

Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement respecting a series of debt securities, the following description will apply to
modifications of indentures.

We may supplement or amend an indenture if the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all
series issued under the indenture affected by the supplement or amendment consent to it. Further, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding debt securities of any series may waive past defaults under the indenture and compliance by us with our covenants with respect to the
debt securities of that series only. Those holders may not, however, waive any default in any payment on any debt security of that series or compliance
with a provision that cannot be supplemented or amended without the

8


-----

consent of each holder affected. Without the consent of each outstanding debt security affected, no modification of the indenture or waiver may:

    - reduce the principal amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

    - reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any debt security;

    - reduce or waive the premium payable upon redemption or alter or waive the provisions with respect to the redemption of the debt securities

(except as may be permitted in the case of a particular series of debt securities);

    - reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any debt security;

    - waive a Default or an Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the debt securities (except a

rescission of acceleration of the debt securities by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

    - except as otherwise permitted under the indenture, release any security that may have been granted with respect to the debt securities;

    - make any debt security payable in currency other than that stated in the debt securities;

    - make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders of debt securities to receive

payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the debt securities;

    - waive a redemption payment with respect to any debt security (except as may be permitted in the case of a particular series of debt

securities);

    - except as otherwise permitted in the indenture, release any guarantor from its obligations under its guarantee or the indenture or change any

guarantee in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of holders; or

    - make any change in the preceding amendment, supplement and waiver provisions (except to increase any percentage set forth therein).

We may supplement or amend an indenture without the consent of any holders of the debt securities in certain circumstances, including:

    - to establish the form of terms of any series of debt securities;

    - to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

    - to provide for the assumption of an Issuer’s or guarantor’s obligations to holders of debt securities in the case of a merger or consolidation or

disposition of all or substantially all of such Issuer’s or guarantor’s assets;

    - to add or release guarantors pursuant to the terms of the indenture;

    - to make any changes that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of debt securities or that do not, taken as a whole,

adversely affect the rights under the indenture of any holder of debt securities;

    - to evidence or provide for the acceptance of appointment under the indenture of a successor Trustee;

    - to add any additional Events of Default; or

    - to secure the debt securities and/or the guarantees.

**_Events of Default and Remedies_**

Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement respecting a series of debt securities, the following description will apply to Events of
Default and remedies under an indenture.

An “Event of Default”, when used in an indenture, will mean any of the following with respect to the debt securities of any series:

    - failure to pay when due the principal of or any premium on any debt security of that series;

    - failure to pay, within 60 days of the due date, interest on any debt security of that series;

    - failure to pay when due any sinking fund payment with respect to any debt securities of that series;

    - failure on the part of the Issuers to comply with the covenant described under “—Consolidation, Merger or Asset Sale”;

    - failure to perform any other covenant in the indenture that continues for 30 days after written notice is given to the Issuers;

    - certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of an Issuer; or

    - any other Event of Default provided under the terms of the debt securities of that series.

An Event of Default for a particular series of debt securities will not necessarily constitute an Event of Default for any other series of debt
securities issued under an indenture. The Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default (except in the payment of principal,
premium, if any, or interest) if it considers such withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders.

If an Event of Default for any series of debt securities occurs and continues, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the debt securities of the series may declare the entire principal of, and accrued interest on, all the debt securities of that series to be due and
payable immediately. If this happens, subject to certain conditions, the holders of a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of
that series can rescind the declaration.

Other than its duties in case of a default, a Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under either indenture at the request,
order or direction of any holders, unless the holders offer the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity. If they provide this reasonable security or
indemnification, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of any series of debt securities may direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding or any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any power conferred upon the Trustee, for that series of debt securities.

**_No Limit on Amount of Debt Securities_**

The indenture will not limit the amount of debt securities that we may issue, unless we indicate otherwise in a prospectus supplement.

**_Registration of Debt Securities_**

We will issue debt securities of a series only in registered form, without coupons, unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement.

**_Minimum Denominations_**

Unless the prospectus supplement states otherwise, the debt securities will be issued only in principal amounts of $1,000 each or integral multiples
of $1,000.

10


-----

**_No Personal Liability_**

The indenture provides that no recourse for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the debt securities or for any
claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuers or the
guarantors in the indenture, or in any of the debt securities or guarantees or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had
against any incorporator, stockholder, officer, director, employee or controlling person of the Issuers or the guarantors or of any successor person
thereof. Each holder, by accepting the debt securities, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the debt securities.

**Payment and Transfer**

The Trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar under the indenture. The Issuers may change the paying agent or registrar without prior
notice to the holders of debt securities, and the Issuers or any of their subsidiaries may act as paying agent or registrar.

If a holder of debt securities has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuers, the Issuers will make all payments on the debt securities in
accordance with those instructions. All other payments on the debt securities will be made at the corporate trust office of the Trustee, unless the Issuers
elect to make interest payments by check mailed to the holders at their addresses set forth in the debt security register.

**Exchange, Registration and Transfer**

Debt securities of any series will be exchangeable for other debt securities of the same series, the same total principal amount and the same terms
but in different authorized denominations in accordance with the indenture. Holders may present debt securities for exchange or registration of transfer
at the office of the registrar. The registrar will effect the transfer or exchange when it is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the person
making the request. We will not charge a service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange of the debt securities. We may, however, require the
payment of any tax or other governmental charge payable for that registration.

We will not be required:

    - to issue, register the transfer of, or exchange debt securities of a series either during a period beginning 15 business days prior to the

selection of debt securities of that series for redemption and ending on the close of business on the day of mailing of the relevant notice of
redemption or repurchase, or between a record date and the next succeeding interest payment date; or

    - to register the transfer of or exchange any debt security called for redemption or repurchase, except the unredeemed portion of any debt

security we are redeeming or repurchasing in part.

**Satisfaction and Discharge; Defeasance**

Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement respecting a series of debt securities, the following description will apply to the
satisfaction and discharge and defeasance of the debt securities.

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding debt securities of any series issued thereunder, when:

(a) either

(1) all outstanding debt securities of that series that have been authenticated (except lost, stolen or destroyed debt securities that have
been replaced or paid and debt securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to
us) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

11


-----

(2) all outstanding debt securities of that series that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable
by reason of the giving of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one
year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee and in any case we have
irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable
U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any
reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness of such debt securities not delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of debt securities that have
been due and payable) or the stated maturity or redemption date;

(b) we have paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by us under the indenture; and

(c) we have delivered an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and
discharge have been satisfied.

The debt securities of a particular series will be subject to legal or covenant defeasance to the extent, and upon the terms and conditions, set forth
in the prospectus supplement.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The indenture provides that, except during the continuance of a Default, the trustee will not be liable, except for the performance of such duties as
are specifically set forth in the indenture. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the trustee will use the same degree of care and skill in
its exercise of the rights and powers vested in it under the indenture as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of such
person’s own affairs.

The indenture and provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 incorporated by reference into the indenture contain limitations on the rights of
the trustee, should it become a creditor of an Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received by it in respect
of any such claims, as security or otherwise. The trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions; provided, however, that if it acquires any
conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict or resign.

**Governing Law**

The indenture and all of the debt securities and guarantees will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

**DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK**

The following summary of the material provisions of the Company’s capital stock is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the
Maryland General Corporation Law (“MGCL”), and the Company’s charter and bylaws. Copies of the Company’s charter and bylaws are on file with
the SEC. We recommend that you review these documents. See “Where You Can Find More Information”.

**Authorized Stock**

The Company’s charter authorizes the Company to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of December 28, 2018, the Company has 370,552,961 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The Company’s charter authorizes the Company’s board of directors to increase the
aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval.

**Common Stock**

The Company may issue common stock from time to time. The Company’s board of directors must approve the amount of stock the Company
sells and the price for which it is sold. All shares of the Company’s common stock, when issued, will be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable.
This means that the full price for the Company’s outstanding common stock will have been paid at the time of issuance and that any holder of the
Company’s common stock will not later be required to pay the Company any additional money for the common stock.

Subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of stock and to the provisions of the Company’s charter regarding the restrictions on
transfer of stock discussed below under the caption “—Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer”, holders of shares of the Company’s common stock are
entitled to receive dividends on such stock when, as and if authorized by the Company’s board of directors out of funds legally available therefore and
declared by the Company and to share ratably in the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to the Company’s stockholders in the event
of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up after payment of or adequate provision for all known debts and liabilities of the Company,
including the preferential rights on dissolution of any class or classes of preferred stock.

Subject to the provisions of the Company’s charter regarding the restrictions on transfer of stock, each outstanding share of the Company’s
common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors and, except as
provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of such shares will possess the exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative
voting in the election of the Company’s board of directors. In uncontested elections, directors are elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of all
votes cast “for” and “against” each director nominee. In contested elections, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. See “Certain Provisions
of Maryland Law and Our Charter and Bylaws—Our Board of Directors”.

Holders of shares of the Company’s common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund, redemption or appraisal rights and
have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any securities of the Company. Subject to the provisions of the Company’s charter regarding the restrictions
on transfer of stock, shares of the Company’s common stock will have equal dividend, liquidation and other rights.

Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of its assets,
engage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside of the ordinary course of business unless approved by the corporation’s board of
directors and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote on the matter unless a lesser

13


-----

percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation’s charter. The Company’s
charter does not provide for a lesser percentage for these matters. However, Maryland law permits a corporation to transfer all or substantially all of its
assets without the approval of the stockholders of the corporation to one or more persons if all of the equity interests of the person or persons are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the corporation. Because operating assets may be held by a corporation’s subsidiaries, as in the Company’s situation, this may
mean that a subsidiary of a corporation can transfer all of its assets without a vote of the corporation’s stockholders.

The Company’s charter authorizes the Company’s board of directors to reclassify any unissued shares of the Company’s common stock into other
classes or series of classes of stock and to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to set the preferences, conversion and other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption for each such class or
series.

**Preferred Stock**

The Company’s charter authorizes the Company’s board of directors to classify any unissued shares of preferred stock and to reclassify any
previously classified but unissued shares of any series. The preferred stock, when issued, will be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable and will
have no preemptive rights. Prior to issuance of shares of each series, the Company’s board of directors is required by the MGCL and the Company’s
charter to set the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions,
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption for each such series. Thus, the Company’s board of directors could authorize the issuance of
shares of preferred stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that
might involve a premium price for holders of the Company’s common stock or which holders might believe to otherwise be in their best interest. As of
December 31, 2017, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding.

**Power to Increase Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of the Company’s Common Stock and Preferred Stock**

The Company believes that the power of the Company’s board of directors, without stockholder approval, to increase the number of authorized
shares of stock, issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of
the Company’s common stock or preferred stock and thereafter to cause the Company to issue such classified or reclassified shares of stock will provide
the Company with flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs which might arise. The additional
classes or series, as well as the common stock, will be available for issuance without further action by the Company’s stockholders, unless stockholder
consent is required by applicable law or the rules of any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Company’s securities
may be listed or traded.

**Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer**

In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, not more than 50% of the
value of the outstanding shares of the Company’s stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to
include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made by the
Company). In addition, if the Company, or one or more owners (actually or constructively) of 10% or more of the Company’s stock, actually or
constructively owns 10% or more of a tenant of the Company’s (or a tenant of any partnership in which the Company is a partner), the rent received by
the Company (either directly or through any such partnership) from such tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income
tests of the Code. The Company’s stock must also be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months
or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made by the Company).

14


-----

The Company’s charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of the Company’s capital stock that are intended to assist the Company
in complying with these requirements and continuing to qualify as a REIT. The relevant sections of its charter provide that, effective upon completion of
the Company’s initial public offering and subject to the exceptions described below, no person or persons acting as a group may own, or be deemed to
own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than (1) 9.8% of the number or value, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock or (2) 9.8% of the number or value, whichever is more restrictive, of the issued and outstanding preferred or
other shares of any class or series of the Company’s stock. We refer to this restriction as the “ownership limit”. The ownership limit in the Company’s
charter is more restrictive than the restrictions on ownership of the Company’s common stock imposed by the Code.

The ownership attribution rules under the Code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related
individuals or entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of the Company’s common
stock (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, the Company’s common stock) by an individual or entity could
nevertheless cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of the Company’s outstanding
common stock and thereby subject the common stock to the ownership limit.

The Company’s board of directors may, in its sole discretion, prospectively or retroactively waive the ownership limit with respect to one or more
stockholders if it determines that such ownership in excess of the ownership limit would not result in the Company being “closely held” under
Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise jeopardize the
Company’s status as a REIT (for example, by causing any tenant of the Company to be considered a “related party tenant” for purposes of the REIT
qualification rules).

As a condition of the Company’s waiver, the Company’s board of directors may require an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service, or IRS,
ruling satisfactory to the Company’s board of directors and representations or undertakings from the applicant with respect to preserving our REIT
status.

In connection with the waiver of the ownership limit or at any other time, the Company’s board of directors may decrease the ownership limit for
all other persons and entities; provided, however, that the decreased ownership limit will not be effective for any person or entity whose percentage
ownership in the Company’s capital stock is in excess of such decreased ownership limit until such time as such person or entity’s percentage of the
Company’s capital stock equals or falls below the decreased ownership limit, but any further acquisition of the Company’s capital stock in excess of
such percentage ownership of the Company’s capital stock will be in violation of the ownership limit. Additionally, the new ownership limit may not
allow five or fewer “individuals” (as defined for purposes of the REIT ownership restrictions under the Code) to beneficially own more than 49.5% of
the value of the Company’s outstanding capital stock.

The Company’s charter generally prohibits:

    - any person from actually or constructively owning shares of the Company’s capital stock that would result in the Company being “closely

held” under Section 856(h) of the Code; and

    - any person from transferring shares of the Company’s capital stock if such transfer would result in shares of the Company’s stock being

beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution).

Any person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of the Company’s common stock that
will or may violate any of the foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will be required to give notice immediately to the Company and
provide the Company with such other information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on the Company’s status
as a REIT. The foregoing provisions on transferability and ownership will not apply if the Company’s

15


-----

board of directors determines that it is no longer in the Company’s best interests to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT.

Pursuant to the Company’s charter, if any purported transfer of the Company’s capital stock or any other event would otherwise result in any
person violating the ownership limit or the other restrictions in the Company’s charter, then any such purported transfer will be void and of no force or
effect with respect to the purported transferee or owner, or the purported owner, as to that number of shares in excess of the ownership limit (rounded up
to the nearest whole share). The number of shares in excess of the ownership limit will be automatically transferred to, and held by, a trust for the
exclusive benefit of one or more charitable organizations selected by the Company. The trustee of the trust will be designated by the Company and must
be unaffiliated with the Company and with any purported owner. The automatic transfer will be effective as of the close of business on the business day
prior to the date of the violative transfer or other event that results in a transfer to the trust. Any dividend or other distribution paid to the purported
owner, prior to the Company’s discovery that the shares had been automatically transferred to a trust as described above, must be repaid to the trustee
upon demand for distribution to the beneficiary of the trust and all dividends and other distributions paid by the Company with respect to such “excess”
shares prior to the sale by the trustee of such shares shall be paid to the trustee for the beneficiary. If the transfer to the trust as described above is not
automatically effective, for any reason, to prevent violation of the applicable ownership limit, then the Company’s charter provides that the transfer of
the excess shares will be void. Subject to Maryland law, effective as of the date that such excess shares have been transferred to the trust, the trustee
shall have the authority (at the trustee’s sole discretion and subject to applicable law) (1) to rescind as void any vote cast by a purported owner prior to
the Company’s discovery that such shares have been transferred to the trust and (2) to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee
acting for the benefit of the beneficiary of the trust, provided that if the Company has already taken irreversible action, then the trustee shall not have the
authority to rescind and recast such vote.

Shares of the Company’s capital stock transferred to the trustee are deemed offered for sale to the Company, or the Company’s designee, at a price
per share equal to the lesser of (1) the price paid by the purported owner for the shares (or, if the event which resulted in the transfer to the trust did not
involve a purchase of such shares of the Company’s capital stock at market price, the market price on the day of the event which resulted in the transfer
of such shares of the Company’s capital stock to the trust) and (2) the market price on the date the Company, or the Company’s designee, accepts such
offer. The Company has the right to accept such offer until the trustee has sold the shares of the Company’s capital stock held in the trust pursuant to the
provisions discussed below. Upon a sale to us, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold terminates and the trustee must distribute the
net proceeds of the sale to the purported owner and any dividends or other distributions held by the trustee with respect to such capital stock will be paid
to the charitable beneficiary.

If the Company does not buy the shares, the trustee must, within 20 days of receiving notice from the Company of the transfer of shares to the
trust, sell the shares to a person or entity designated by the trustee who could own the shares without violating the ownership limit. After that, the trustee
must distribute to the purported owner an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the net price paid by the purported owner for the shares (or, if the event which
resulted in the transfer to the trust did not involve a purchase of such shares at market price, the market price on the day of the event which resulted in
the transfer of such shares of our capital stock to the trust) and (2) the net sales proceeds received by the trust for the shares. Any proceeds in excess of
the amount distributable to the purported owner will be distributed to the beneficiary.

All persons who own, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than 5% (or such other percentage as provided in the
regulations promulgated under the Code) of the lesser of the number or value of the shares of the Company’s outstanding capital stock must give written
notice to the Company within 30 days after the end of each calendar year. In addition, each stockholder will, upon demand, be required to disclose to the
Company in writing such information with respect to the direct, indirect and constructive ownership of shares of the Company’s stock as the Company’s
board of directors deems reasonably necessary to comply with the provisions of the Code applicable to a REIT, to comply with the requirements of any
taxing authority or governmental agency or to determine any such compliance.

16


-----

All certificates representing shares of the Company’s capital stock will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above.

These ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of the Company that might involve a premium price over
the then prevailing market price for the holders of some, or a majority, of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock or which such holders
might believe to be otherwise in their best interest.

**Transfer Agent and Registrar**

The transfer agent and registrar for the Company’s common stock is American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC.

**CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF MARYLAND LAW AND OF THE COMPANY’S**

**CHARTER AND BYLAWS**

The following summary of certain provisions of the MGCL and of the Company’s charter and bylaws does not purport to be complete and is
subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, reference to the MGCL and the Company’s charter and bylaws. Copies of the Company’s charter and bylaws
are on file with the SEC. We recommend that you review these documents. See “Where You Can Find More Information”.

**The Company’s Board of Directors**

The Company’s charter and bylaws provide that the number of the Company’s directors is to be established by the Company’s board of directors
but may not be fewer than one nor, under the MGCL, more than 15. Currently, the Company’s board is comprised of seven directors. Any vacancy, other
than one resulting from an increase in the number of directors, may be filled, at any regular meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose, by
a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum. Any vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of the Company’s directors
must be filled by a majority of the entire board of directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected to serve until the next election of
directors and until his successor shall be elected and qualified.

Pursuant to the Company’s charter, each member of the Company’s board of directors is elected until the next annual meeting of stockholders and
until his successor is elected, with the current members’ terms expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2019. Holders of shares of the
Company’s common stock have no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Consequently, at each annual meeting of stockholders, all of
the members of the Company’s board of directors will stand for election and the Company’s directors will be elected by a majority of votes cast in
uncontested elections and by a plurality of votes cast in contested elections. Directors may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of
two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.

**Business Combinations**

Maryland law prohibits “business combinations” between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested
stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations
include a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, certain transfers of assets, certain stock issuances and
reclassifications. Maryland law defines an interested stockholder as:

    - any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation’s voting stock; or

    - an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner

of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of the corporation.

A person is not an interested stockholder if the board of directors approves in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have
become an interested stockholder. However, in approving the transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance,
at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.

After the five year prohibition, any business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by
the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:

    - 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the then outstanding shares of voting stock; and

18


-----

    - two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the voting stock other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or

with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or shares held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.

These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in
the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.

The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are approved by the board of directors before the
time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.

As permitted by Maryland law, the Company’s charter includes a provision excluding the Company from these provisions of the MGCL and,
consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between the Company and any
interested stockholder of the Company’s unless the Company later amends its charter, with stockholder approval, to modify or eliminate this exclusion
provision. We believe that the Company’s ownership restrictions will substantially reduce the risk that a stockholder would become an “interested
stockholder” within the meaning of the Maryland business combination statute. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will not opt into
the business combination provisions of the MGCL at a future date, subject to stockholder approval as required under the MGCL and the Company’s
charter.

**Control Share Acquisitions**

The MGCL provides that a holder of “control shares” of a Maryland corporation acquired in a “control share acquisition” has no voting rights
with respect to the control shares, except to the extent approved at a special meeting by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast
on the matter. Shares owned by the acquiror or by officers or directors who are the Company’s employees are excluded from shares entitled to vote on
the matter. “Control shares” are voting shares which, if aggregated with all other shares previously acquired by the acquiror or in respect of which the
acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy, would entitle the acquiror to exercise
voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: (i) one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or
more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to
vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of issued and outstanding
control shares, subject to certain exceptions.

A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including an undertaking to pay
expenses, may compel a corporation’s board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the
voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders’ meeting.

If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by Maryland
law, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares, except those for which voting rights
have previously been approved, for fair value determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last
control share acquisition by the acquiror or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved. If
voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders’ meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of a majority
of the voting power, then all other stockholders are entitled to demand and receive fair value for their stock, or provided for in the “dissenters” rights
provisions of the MGCL may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less
than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition.

19


-----

The control share acquisition statute does not apply (i) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party
to the transaction or (ii) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.

The Company’s charter contains a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of the
Company’s stock. There can be no assurance that the Company will not opt into the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL in the future,
subject to stockholder approval as required under the MGCL and the Company’s charter.

**Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act**

The Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act (“MUTA”) also permits Maryland corporations that are subject to the Exchange Act and have at least
three outside directors to elect, by resolution of the board of directors or by provision in its charter or bylaws and notwithstanding any contrary provision
in the charter or bylaws, to be subject to any or all of the following corporate governance provisions:

    - the board of directors may classify itself without the vote of stockholders. A board of directors classified in that manner cannot be altered by

amendment to the charter of the corporation;

    - a special meeting of the stockholders will be called only at the request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled

to be cast at the meeting;

    - the board of directors may reserve for itself the right to fix the number of directors and to fill vacancies created by the death, removal or

resignation of a director;

    - a director may be removed only by the vote of the holders of two-thirds of the stock entitled to vote; and

    - provide that all vacancies on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in

office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the
vacancy occurred.

A board of directors may implement all or any of these provisions without amending the charter or bylaws and without stockholder approval. If
implemented, these provisions could discourage offers to acquire a company’s stock and could increase the difficulty of completing an offer. The
Company has opted out of MUTA in its charter and may not opt back in without stockholder approval.

**Amendment to the Company’s Charter**

Pursuant to the MGCL, the Company’s charter may be amended only if declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except that the Company’s board of directors is
able, without stockholder approval, to amend the Company’s charter to change the Company’s corporate name or the name or designation or par value
of any class or series of stock.

**Dissolution of the Company**

A voluntary dissolution of the Company must be declared advisable by a majority of the entire board of directors and approved by the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

**Advance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business**

The Company’s bylaws provide that with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, the only business to be considered and the only proposals
to be acted upon will be those properly brought before the annual meeting:

    - pursuant to the Company’s notice of the meeting;

20


-----

    - by, or at the direction of, a majority of the Company’s board of directors; or

    - by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in the Company’s

bylaws.

With respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in the Company’s notice of meeting may be brought before the
meeting of stockholders unless otherwise provided by law.

Nominations of persons for election to the Company’s board of directors at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may be made only:

    - by, or at the direction of, the Company’s board of directors; or

    - by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in the Company’s

bylaws.

Generally, under the Company’s bylaws, a stockholder seeking to nominate a director or bring other business before the Company’s annual
meeting of stockholders must deliver a notice to the Company’s secretary not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice to stockholders for the prior year’s annual meeting. For a
stockholder seeking to nominate a candidate for the Company’s board of directors, the notice must describe various matters regarding the nominee,
including name, address, occupation and number of shares of common stock held, and other specified matters. For a stockholder seeking to propose
other business, the notice must include a description of the proposed business, the reasons for the proposal and other specified matters.

**Indemnification and Limitation of Directors and Officers Liability**

The MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation
and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services
or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action. The Company’s charter limits the personal
liability of the Company’s directors and officers for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted under current Maryland law, and the Company’s
charter and bylaws provide that a director or officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent required or permitted by Maryland law from and against
any claim or liability to which such director or officer may become subject by reason of his or her status as a director or officer of the Company.
Maryland law allows directors and officers to be indemnified against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements, and expenses actually incurred in
connection with any proceeding to which they may be made a party by reason of their service on those or other capacities, unless the following can be
established:

    - the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding and was committed in bad

faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty;

    - the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or

    - with respect to any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe his or her act or omission was unlawful.

The MGCL requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which the Company’s charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer
who has been successful on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any claim to which he or she is made a party by reason of his or her service in that
capacity.

However, under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or
for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly

21


-----

received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses. In addition, the MGCL permits a corporation to advance
reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation’s receipt of:

    - a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for

indemnification by the corporation; and

    - a written undertaking by the director or on the director’s behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately

determined that the director did not meet the standard of conduct.

The Company’s charter authorizes the Company to obligate itself to indemnify and the Company’s bylaws do obligate the Company, to the fullest
extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, to indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate
entitlement to indemnification, pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to:

    - any present or former director or officer who is made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity; or

    - any individual who, while a director or officer of the Company and at the Company’s request, serves or has served another corporation, real

estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise as a director, officer, partner or trustee
of such corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made
a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity.

The Company’s charter and bylaws also permit the Company to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of the
Company’s in any of the capacities described above.

The Company’s stockholders have no personal liability for indemnification payments or other obligations under any indemnification agreements
or arrangements. However, indemnification could reduce the legal remedies available to us and the Company’s stockholders against the indemnified
individuals.

This provision for indemnification of the Company’s directors and officers does not limit a stockholder’s ability to obtain injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies for a violation of a director’s or an officer’s duties to the Company or to the Company’s stockholders, although these equitable
remedies may not be effective in some circumstances.

In addition to any indemnification to which the Company’s directors and officers are entitled pursuant to the Company’s charter and bylaws and
the MGCL, the Company’s charter and bylaws provide that, with the approval of the Company’s board of directors, the Company may indemnify other
employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted under Maryland law, whether they are serving the Company or, at the Company’s request, any other
entity. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of the Company’s directors and executive officers, and the Company
maintains a directors and officers liability insurance policy. Although the form of the indemnification agreement offers substantially the same scope of
coverage afforded by provisions in the Company’s charter and bylaws, it provides greater assurance to the directors and officers that indemnification
will be available, because, as a contract, it cannot be modified unilaterally in the future by the board of directors or by stockholders to eliminate the
rights it provides.

Insofar as the foregoing provisions permit indemnification of directors, officers or persons controlling us for liability arising under the Securities
Act, the Company has been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, this indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
is therefore unenforceable.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP**

We have summarized the material terms and provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating
Partnership (the “partnership agreement”). This summary is not complete. For more detail, you should refer to the partnership agreement itself, a copy of
which has previously been filed with the SEC and which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplements.
See “Where You Can Find More Information”.

**Management of the Operating Partnership**

The Operating Partnership was organized as a Delaware limited partnership on September 10, 2003. The initial partnership agreement was entered
into on that date and was last amended and restated on July 31, 2007. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, as the sole equity owner of the sole general
partner of the Operating Partnership, Medical Properties Trust, LLC, the Company has, subject to certain protective rights of limited partners described
below, full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the Operating Partnership. The Company has the
power to cause the Operating Partnership to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, refinancings and selection of
tenants, and to cause changes in the Operating Partnership’s line of business and distribution policies. However, any amendment to the partnership
agreement that would affect the redemption rights of the limited partners or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the limited partners requires the
consent of limited partners, other than the Company, holding more than 50% of the units of the Company’s operating partnership held by such partners.

**Transferability of Interests**

The Company may not voluntarily withdraw from the Operating Partnership or transfer or assign the Company’s interest in the Operating
Partnership or engage in any merger, consolidation or other combination, or sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets, in a transaction which
results in a change of control of the Company unless:

    - the Company receives the consent of limited partners holding more than 50% of the partnership interests of the limited partners, other than

those held by the Company or its subsidiaries;

    - as a result of such transaction, all limited partners will have the right to receive for each partnership unit an amount of cash, securities or

other property equal in value to the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property paid in the transaction to a holder of one share of
our common stock, provided that if, in connection with the transaction, a purchase, tender or exchange offer shall have been made to and
accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, each holder of partnership units shall
be given the option to exchange its partnership units for the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property that a limited partner would
have received had it (1) exercised its redemption right (described below) and (2) sold, tendered or exchanged pursuant to the offer shares of
the Company’s common stock received upon exercise of the redemption right immediately prior to the expiration of the offer; or

    - the Company is the surviving entity in the transaction and either (1) the Company’s stockholders do not receive cash, securities or other

property in the transaction or (2) all limited partners receive for each partnership unit an amount of cash, securities or other property having
a value that is no less than the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property received in the transaction by the Company’s
stockholders.

The Company also may merge with or into or consolidate with another entity if immediately after such merger or consolidation (1) substantially
all of the assets of the successor or surviving entity, other than partnership units held by the Company, are contributed, directly or indirectly, to the
partnership as a capital contribution in exchange for partnership units with a fair market value equal to the value of the assets so

23


-----

contributed as determined by the survivor in good faith and (2) the survivor expressly agrees to assume all of the Company’s obligations under the
partnership agreement and the partnership agreement shall be amended after any such merger or consolidation so as to arrive at a new method of
calculating the amounts payable upon exercise of the redemption right that approximates the existing method for such calculation as closely as
reasonably possible.

The Company also may (1) transfer all or any portion of the Company’s general partnership interest to (A) a wholly-owned subsidiary or (B) a
parent company, and following such transfer may withdraw as general partner and (2) engage in a transaction required by law or by the rules of any
national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Company’s securities may be listed or traded.

**Capital Contribution**

The Company contributed the net proceeds of the Company’s April 2004 private placement and subsequent public offerings as capital
contributions in exchange for units of the Operating Partnership. The partnership agreement provides that if the Operating Partnership requires
additional funds at any time in excess of funds available to the Operating Partnership from borrowing or capital contributions, the Company may borrow
such funds from a financial institution or other lender and lend such funds to the Operating Partnership on the same terms and conditions as are
applicable to the Company’s borrowing of such funds. Under the partnership agreement, the Company is obligated to contribute the proceeds of any
offering of shares of the Company’s stock as additional capital to the Operating Partnership. The Company is authorized to cause the Operating
Partnership to issue partnership interests for less than fair market value if the Company has concluded in good faith that such issuance is in both the
Operating Partnership’s and the Company’s best interests. If the Company contributes additional capital to the Operating Partnership, the Company will
receive additional partnership units and the Company’s percentage interest will be increased on a proportionate basis based upon the amount of such
additional capital contributions and the value of the Operating Partnership at the time of such contributions. Conversely, the percentage interests of the
limited partners will be decreased on a proportionate basis in the event of additional capital contributions by the Company. In addition, if the Company
contributes additional capital to the Operating Partnership, the Company will revalue the property of the Operating Partnership to its fair market value,
as determined by the Company, and the capital accounts of the partners will be adjusted to reflect the manner in which the unrealized gain or loss
inherent in such property, that has not been reflected in the capital accounts previously, would be allocated among the partners under the terms of the
partnership agreement if there were a taxable disposition of such property for its fair market value, as determined by us, on the date of the revaluation.
The Operating Partnership may issue preferred partnership interests, in connection with acquisitions of property or otherwise, which could have priority
over common partnership interests with respect to distributions from the Operating Partnership, including the partnership interests that the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary owns as general partner.

**Redemption Rights**

Pursuant to Section 8.04 of the partnership agreement, the limited partners, other than the Company, will receive redemption rights, which will
enable them to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem their limited partnership units in exchange for cash or, at the Company’s option, shares of the
Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, dividends, recapitalization and similar events. Under
Section 8.04 of the partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will be prohibited from exercising their redemption rights for 12 months
after they are issued, unless this waiting period is waived or shortened by the Company’s board of directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a limited
partner will not be entitled to exercise its redemption rights if the delivery of common stock to the redeeming limited partner would:

    - result in any person owning, directly or indirectly, common stock in excess of the stock ownership limit in the Company’s charter;

    - result in the Company’s shares of stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution);

24


-----

    - cause the Company to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the ownership interests in a tenant of the Company’s or the

partnership’s real property, within the meaning of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code; or

    - cause the acquisition of common stock by such redeeming limited partner to be “integrated” with any other distribution of common stock for

purposes of complying with the registration provisions of the Securities Act.

The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, waive any of these restrictions.

With respect to the partnership units issuable in connection with the acquisition or development of our facilities, the redemption rights may be
exercised by the limited partners at any time after the first anniversary of our acquisition of these facilities; provided, however, unless the Company
otherwise agrees:

    - a limited partner may not exercise the redemption right for fewer than 1,000 partnership units or, if such limited partner holds fewer than

1,000 partnership units, the limited partner must redeem all of the partnership units held by such limited partner;

    - a limited partner may not exercise the redemption right for more than the number of partnership units that would, upon redemption, result in

such limited partner or any other person owning, directly or indirectly, common stock in excess of the ownership limitation in the
Company’s charter; and

     - a limited partner may not exercise the redemption right more than two times annually.

The number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the redemption rights will be adjusted to account for stock splits, mergers,
consolidations or similar pro rata stock transactions.

The partnership agreement requires that the Operating Partnership be operated in a manner that enables the Company to satisfy the requirements
for being classified as a REIT, to avoid any federal income or excise tax liability imposed by the Code (other than any federal income tax liability
associated with our retained capital gains) and to ensure that the partnership will not be classified as a “publicly traded partnership” taxable as a
corporation under Section 7704 of the Code.

In addition to the administrative and operating costs and expenses incurred by the Operating Partnership, the Operating Partnership generally will
pay all of the Company’s administrative costs and expenses, including:

    - all expenses relating to the Company’s continuity of existence;

    - all expenses relating to offerings and registration of securities;

    - all expenses associated with the preparation and filing of any of the Company’s periodic reports under federal, state or local laws or

regulations;

    - all expenses associated with the Company’s compliance with laws, rules and regulations promulgated by any regulatory body; and

    - all of the Company’s other operating or administrative costs incurred in the ordinary course of business on behalf of the Operating

Partnership.

**Distributions**

The partnership agreement provides that the Operating Partnership will distribute cash from operations, including net sale or refinancing proceeds,
but excluding net proceeds from the sale of the Operating Partnership’s property in connection with the liquidation of the Operating Partnership, at such
time and in such amounts as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, to the Company and the limited partners in accordance with their
respective percentage interests in the Operating Partnership.

25


-----

Upon liquidation of the Operating Partnership, after payment of, or adequate provision for, debts and obligations of the partnership, including any
partner loans, any remaining assets of the partnership will be distributed to the Company and the limited partners with positive capital accounts in
accordance with their respective positive capital account balances.

**Allocations**

Profits and losses of the partnership, including depreciation and amortization deductions, for each fiscal year generally are allocated to the
Company and the limited partners in accordance with the respective percentage interests in the partnership. All of the foregoing allocations are subject
to compliance with the provisions of Sections 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder. The Operating
Partnership expects to use the “traditional method” under Section 704(c) of the Code for allocating items with respect to contributed property acquired
in connection with the offering for which the fair market value differs from the adjusted tax basis at the time of contribution.

**Term**

The Operating Partnership will have perpetual existence, or until sooner dissolved upon:

    - the Company’s bankruptcy, dissolution, removal or withdrawal, unless the limited partners elect to continue the partnership;

    - the passage of 90 days after the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the partnership; or

    - an election by the Company in its capacity as the owner of the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.

**Tax Matters**

Through the Company’s ownership of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has authority to make tax elections under the
Code on behalf of the Operating Partnership.

**U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

This section summarizes the current material federal income tax consequences to Medical Properties and the Operating Partnership generally
resulting from the treatment of Medical Properties as a REIT. Because this section is a general summary, it does not address all of the potential tax issues
that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances. Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, P.C., or Baker Donelson, has
acted as our counsel, has reviewed this summary (except with respect to the general summary of material U.S. federal income tax considerations
contained under the heading “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation of Noteholders”), and is of the opinion that the discussion contained
herein fairly summarizes the federal income tax consequences that are material to a holder of our common stock. The discussion does not address all
aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular securityholders in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances, or to certain types of
securityholders that are subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial
institutions or broker-dealers, and non-United States individuals and foreign corporations.

The statements in this section of the opinion of Baker Donelson, referred to as the Tax Opinion, are based on the current federal income tax laws
governing qualification as a REIT. We cannot assure you that new laws, interpretations of law or court decisions, any of which may take effect
retroactively, will not cause any statement in this section to be inaccurate. You should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”), and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions set forth in those opinions.

This section is not a substitute for careful tax planning, nor does it constitute tax advice. We urge you to consult your own tax advisors regarding
the specific federal, state, local, foreign and other tax consequences to you, in the light of your own particular circumstances, of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of shares of our common stock, our election to be taxed as a REIT and the effect of potential changes in applicable tax laws.

**Taxation of Our Company**

We were previously taxed as a subchapter S corporation. We revoked our subchapter S election on April 6, 2004 and we have elected to be taxed
as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year that
began on April 6, 2004 and ended on December 31, 2004. In connection with this prospectus, our REIT counsel, Baker Donelson, has opined that, for
federal income tax purposes, we are and have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification to be taxed as a REIT under the Code
commencing with our initial short taxable year ended December 31, 2004, and that our current and proposed method of operations as described in this
prospectus and as represented to our counsel by us satisfies currently, and will enable us to continue to satisfy in the future, the requirements for such
qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for future taxable years. This opinion, however, is based on factual assumptions and representations
made by us to Baker Donelson concerning our organization, our proposed ownership and operations, and other matters relating to our ability to qualify
as a REIT, and is expressly conditioned upon the accuracy of such assumptions and representations.

We believe that our proposed future method of operation will enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be given that
our beliefs or expectations will be fulfilled, as such qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, for each taxable year, various
tests imposed under the Code as discussed below. Those qualification tests involve the percentage of income that we earn from specified sources, the
percentage of our assets that falls within specified categories, the diversity of our stock ownership, and the percentage of our earnings that we distribute.
Baker Donelson will not review our compliance with those tests on a continuing basis. Accordingly, with respect to our current and future taxable years,
no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operation will satisfy such requirements. For a discussion of the tax consequences of our failure
to maintain our qualification as a REIT, see “—Requirements for Qualification—Failure to Qualify”.

27


-----

The sections of the Code relating to qualification and operation as a REIT, and the federal income taxation of a REIT and its stockholders, are
highly technical and complex. The following discussion sets forth only the material aspects of those sections. This summary is qualified in its entirety by
the applicable Code provisions and the related rules and regulations.

We generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders. The benefit of that
tax treatment is that it avoids the “double taxation”, or taxation at both the corporate and stockholder levels, that generally results from owning stock in
a corporation. However, we will be subject to federal tax in the following circumstances:

    - We are subject to the corporate federal income tax on taxable income, including net capital gain, that we do not distribute to stockholders

during, or within a specified time period after, the calendar year in which the income is earned.

    - For tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2018, we are subject to the corporate “alternative minimum tax” on any items of tax preference

that we do not distribute or allocate to stockholders. The corporate alternative minimum tax has been repealed effective for tax years
beginning on or after January 1, 2018.

    - We are subject to tax, at the highest corporate rate, on:

         - net gain from the sale or other disposition of property acquired through foreclosure (“foreclosure property”) that we hold primarily

for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, and

         - other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property.

    - We are subject to a 100% tax on net income from sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, that we hold

primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.

    - We fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test, as described below under “—Requirements for Qualification—

Gross Income Tests”, but nonetheless continue to qualify as a REIT because we meet other requirements, we will be subject to a 100% tax
on:

         - the greater of (1) the amount by which we fail the 75% gross income test, or (2) the amount by which we fail the 95% gross income

test multiplied by

         - a fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

    - If we fail to distribute during a calendar year at least the sum of: (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year, (2) 95% of our REIT

capital gain net income for the year and (3) any undistributed taxable income from earlier periods, then we will be subject to a 4% excise tax
on the excess of the required distribution over the amount we actually distributed.

    - If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification during a taxable year, other than a gross income test or an asset test and

such failure is due to reasonable cause, we may retain our REIT qualification if we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure.

    - We may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net long-term capital gain. In that case, a United States stockholder would be taxed on its

proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain (to the extent that we make a timely designation of such gain to the
stockholder) and would receive a credit or refund for its proportionate share of the tax we paid, with an adjustment made to increase the
stockholder’s basis in our stock by the difference between (i) the amount of capital gain included in income and (ii) the amount of tax
deemed paid by the stockholder.

    - We may be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary that are not conducted at arm’s-length.

    - If we acquire any asset from a “C corporation” (that is, a corporation generally subject to the full corporate-level tax) in a transaction in

which the basis of the asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of the C corporation, and we
recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during the 5 year period beginning on the date that we acquired the asset, then the asset’s
“built-in” gain will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate.

28


-----

**Requirements for Qualification**

To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must meet various (1) organizational requirements, (2) gross income tests, (3) asset tests, and (4) annual
distribution requirements.

Organizational Requirements. A REIT is a corporation, trust or association that meets each of the following requirements:

(1) it is managed by one or more trustees or directors;

(2) its beneficial ownership is evidenced by transferable stock, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;

(3) it would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for its election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code;

(4) it is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to special provisions of the federal income tax laws;

(5) at least 100 persons are beneficial owners of its stock or ownership certificates (determined without reference to any rules of attribution);

(6) not more than 50% in value of its outstanding stock or ownership certificates is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals,
which the federal income tax laws define to include certain entities, during the last half of any taxable year; and

(7) it elects to be a REIT, or has made such election for a previous taxable year, which election has not been revoked or terminated, and
satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the IRS that must be met to elect and maintain REIT status.

We must meet requirements one through four during our entire taxable year and must meet requirement five during at least 335 days of a taxable
year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. If we comply with all the requirements for ascertaining
information concerning the ownership of our outstanding stock in a taxable year and have no reason to know that we violated requirement six, we will
be deemed to have satisfied requirement six for that taxable year. We did not have to satisfy requirements five and six for our taxable year ending
December 31, 2004. After the issuance of common stock pursuant to our April 2004 private placement, we had issued common stock with enough
diversity of ownership to satisfy requirements five and six as set forth above. Our charter provides for restrictions regarding the ownership and transfer
of our shares of common stock so that we should continue to satisfy these requirements. The provisions of our charter restricting the ownership and
transfer of our shares of common stock are described in “Description of Capital Stock—Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer”.

For purposes of determining stock ownership under requirement six, an “individual” generally includes a supplemental unemployment
compensation benefits plan, a private foundation, or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes. An
“individual”, however, generally does not include a trust that is a qualified employee pension or profit sharing trust under the federal income tax laws,
and beneficiaries of such a trust will be treated as holding our shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the trust for purposes of requirement six.

A corporation that is a “qualified REIT subsidiary”, or QRS, is not treated as a corporation separate from its parent REIT. All assets, liabilities,
and items of income, deduction and credit of a QRS are treated as assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction and credit of the REIT. A QRS is a
corporation other than a “taxable REIT subsidiary” as described below, all of the capital stock of which is owned by the REIT. Thus, in applying the
requirements described herein, any QRS that we own will be ignored, and all assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction and credit of such
subsidiary will be treated as our assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction and credit.

An unincorporated domestic entity with two or more owners that is eligible to elect its tax classification under Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-3 but does not make such an election is generally treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. In the case of a REIT that is
a partner in a partnership that has other partners, the REIT is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and as earning its
allocable share of the gross income of the partnership for purposes of the applicable REIT qualification tests. We treat our operating partnership as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, our proportionate share of the assets, liabilities and items of income of the operating
partnership and any other partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which
we acquire an interest, directly or indirectly, is treated as our assets and gross income for purposes of applying the various REIT qualification
requirements.

A REIT is permitted to own up to 100% of the stock of one or more “taxable REIT subsidiaries” or TRSs. We have formed and made taxable
REIT subsidiary elections with respect to MPT Development Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in January 2004 (“MPT TRS”) and MPT
Finance Corporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in April 2011. We also made a taxable REIT subsidiary election for MPT Covington TRS,
Inc. (“MPT Covington TRS”) which was formed in 2010 and has since been dissolved. We have also formed limited liability companies wholly-owned
by MPT TRS which are disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation that may earn
income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT. Generally, the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly file an election
with the IRS to treat the subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A taxable REIT subsidiary will pay income tax at regular corporate rates on any
income that it earns. Further, the rules impose a 100% excise tax on certain types of transactions between a taxable REIT subsidiary and its parent REIT
or the REIT’s tenants that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. We may engage in activities indirectly through a taxable REIT subsidiary as
necessary or convenient to avoid obtaining the benefit of income or services that would jeopardize our REIT status if we engaged in the activities
directly. In particular, we would likely engage in activities through a taxable REIT subsidiary if we wished to provide services to unrelated parties which
might produce income that does not qualify under the gross income tests described below. We might also engage in otherwise prohibited transactions
through a taxable REIT subsidiary. See description below under “—Requirements for Qualification—Prohibited Transactions”. A taxable REIT
subsidiary may not operate or manage a health care facility, though a health care facility leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary from a REIT may be
operated on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary by an eligible independent contractor. For purposes of this definition a “health care facility” means a
hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends
medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and which is operated by a service provider which is eligible for participation in the Medicare
program under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with respect to such facility. MPT Covington TRS, Inc. was formed specifically for the purpose of
leasing a health care facility from us, subleasing that facility to an entity in which it owned an equity interest, and having that facility operated by an
eligible independent contractor. We obtained a private letter ruling (the “Covington Letter Ruling”), from the IRS holding that ownership of the equity
interest and the operation of the facility in accordance with the agreements among the parties would not adversely affect the taxable REIT subsidiary
status of MPT Covington TRS. We have structured other transactions in which an MPT TRS owns an indirect equity interest in a tenant entity in a
similar manner, including with the operating subsidiaries of Ernest Health, Inc. (“Ernest”), and may structure other such transactions similarly in the
future. We disposed of our equity interest in Ernest Health Holdings, LLC during 2018, and as a result, with respect to Ernest, we no longer own a 10%
equity interest in any entity to which MPT TRS subleases a health care facility which is operated by an independent eligible contractor. Therefore, we
plan to terminate the leases with MPT TRS with respect to Ernest facilities effective January 1, 2019. Thereafter subsidiaries of our operating
partnership will lease the underlying real property directly to subsidiaries of Ernest.

_Gross Income Tests. We must satisfy two gross income tests annually to maintain our qualification as a REIT. First, at least 75% of our gross_
income for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income that we derive, directly or indirectly, from investments relating to real property or
mortgages on real property or

30


-----

qualified temporary investment income. Qualifying income for purposes of that 75% gross income test generally includes:

    - rents from real property;

    - interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property;

    - dividends or other distributions on, and gain from the sale of, shares in other REITs;

    - gain from the sale of real estate assets;

    - income derived from the temporary investment of new capital that is attributable to the issuance of our shares of common stock or a public

offering of our debt with a maturity date of at least five years and that we receive during the one year period beginning on the date on which
we received such new capital; and

    - gross income from foreclosure property.

Second, in general, at least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year must consist of income that is qualifying income for purposes of the
75% gross income test, other types of interest and dividends or gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities. Gross income from our sale of
property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is excluded from both the numerator and the denominator in both
income tests. In addition, income and gain from “hedging transactions” that we enter into to hedge indebtedness incurred or to be incurred to acquire or
carry real estate assets and that are clearly and timely identified as such also will be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for purposes
of the 95% gross income test and the 75% gross income test. Passive foreign exchange gain is excluded from the 95% gross income test and real estate
foreign exchange gain is excluded from both the 95% and the 75% gross income tests. The following paragraphs discuss the specific application of the
gross income tests to us.

The Secretary of the Treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of gain or income qualify or not under the 75% and
95% gross income tests, or are to be excluded from the measure of gross income for such purposes.

_Rents from Real Property. Rent that we receive from our real property will qualify as “rents from real property”, which is qualifying income for_
purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests, only if the following conditions are met.

First, the rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. Participating rent, however, will qualify as “rents from
real property” if it is based on percentages of receipts or sales and the percentages:

    - are fixed at the time the leases are entered into;

    - are not renegotiated during the term of the leases in a manner that has the effect of basing rent on income or profits; and

    - conform with normal business practice.

More generally, the rent will not qualify as “rents from real property” if, considering the relevant lease and all the surrounding circumstances, the
arrangement does not conform with normal business practice, but is in reality used as a means of basing the rent on income or profits. We have
represented to Baker Donelson that we intend to set and accept rents which are fixed dollar amounts or a fixed percentage of gross revenue, and not
determined to any extent by reference to any person’s income or profits, in compliance with the rules above.

Second, we must not own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the stock or the assets or net profits of any tenant, referred to as a related
party tenant, other than a taxable REIT subsidiary. Failure to adhere to this

31


-----

limitation would cause the rental income from the related party tenant to not be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income
tests. The constructive ownership rules generally provide that, if 10% or more in value of our stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person,
we are considered as owning the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for such person. In addition, our charter prohibits transfers of our shares that
would cause us to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the ownership interests in a tenant. We do not own, actually or constructively, 10% or
more of any tenant other than a taxable REIT subsidiary. We have represented to counsel that we will not rent any facility to a related-party tenant. We
have structured other transactions in a manner consistent with the Covington Letter Ruling and may structure future transactions in a similar manner. In
particular, our leases with subsidiaries of Ernest are currently structured in a similar manner with the exception that, prior to October 4, 2018, Guiding
Health Management Group, LLC (“GHMG”), formed by the prior management of Ernest and its subsidiaries, was the manager of the Ernest facilities.
We disposed of our equity interest in Ernest Health Holdings, LLC during 2018, and as a result, with respect to Ernest, we no longer own a 10% equity
interest in an entity to which MPT TRS subleases a health care facility which is operated by an eligible independent contractor. Therefore, we plan to
terminate the leases with MPT TRS with respect to Ernest facilities effective January 1, 2019. Thereafter subsidiaries of our operating partnership will
lease the underlying real property directly to subsidiaries of Ernest. Prior to our disposition of our investment in the operations of Capella Healthcare,
Inc. (“Capella”), our leases with subsidiaries of Capella were structured in a similar manner with a management company, Sunergeo Health Partners,
LLC (“Sunergeo”), formed by the prior management of Capella and its subsidiaries, as the manager of the Capella facilities. GHMG and Sunergeo
previously operated Ernest and its subsidiaries and Capella and its subsidiaries, respectively, as officers and employees. Although certain management
personnel remained as officers of Ernest and Capella, they became employees of and were compensated by GHMG or Sunergeo. We believe that during
the time in which we held an investment in the operations of Ernest GHMG met, GHMG meets, and during the time in which we held an investment in
the operations of Capella Sunergeo met, the definition of an “eligible independent contractor” which is any independent contractor if, at the time such
contractor enters into an agreement with a taxable REIT subsidiary to operate a qualified health care facility, such contractor is actively engaged in the
trade or business of operating such facilities for any person who is not a related person to the REIT or the taxable REIT subsidiary. There is no assurance
that the IRS will not take a contrary position with respect to the structuring of these and other such transactions. In addition, MPT TRS has and will
make, and prior to its dissolution in 2016, MPT Covington TRS made, loans to tenants to acquire operations and for other purposes. We have structured
and will structure these loans as debt and believe that they will be characterized as such, and that our rental income from our tenant borrowers will be
treated as qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary
position. If the IRS were to successfully treat a loan to a particular tenant as an equity interest, the tenant would be a related party tenant with respect to
us, the rent that we receive from the tenant would not be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests, and we could lose our REIT
status.

However, as stated above, we believe that these loans will be treated as debt rather than equity interests. Finally, because the constructive
ownership rules are broad and it is not possible to monitor continually direct and indirect transfers of our shares, no absolute assurance can be given that
such transfers or other events of which we have no knowledge will not cause us to own constructively 10% or more of a tenant other than a taxable
REIT subsidiary at some future date.

We currently own 100% of the stock of MPT TRS and MPT Finance Corporation, Inc., both of which are taxable REIT subsidiaries, and may in
the future own up to 100% of the stock of one or more additional taxable REIT subsidiaries. In addition, prior to our disposition of our investments in
the operations of Ernest and Capella, Ernest, Capella and their respective corporate subsidiaries were taxable REIT subsidiaries because of MPT TRS’s
indirect ownership of more than a 35% interest in Ernest and Capella. Under an exception to the related-party tenant rule described in the preceding
paragraph, rent that we receive from a taxable REIT subsidiary will qualify as “rents from real property” as long as (1) the taxable REIT subsidiary is a
qualifying taxable REIT subsidiary (among other things, it does not operate or manage a health care facility), (2) at least 90% of the leased space in the
facility is leased to persons other than taxable REIT subsidiaries and related party tenants, and

32


-----

(3) the amount paid by the taxable REIT subsidiary to rent space at the facility is substantially comparable to rents paid by other tenants of the facility
for comparable space. In addition, rents paid to a REIT by a taxable REIT subsidiary with respect to a “qualified health care property” (as defined below
under “—Requirements for Qualification—Foreclosure Property”), operated on behalf of such taxable REIT subsidiary by a person who is an “eligible
independent contractor” (as defined above), are qualifying rental income for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests. We have structured leases
with taxable REIT subsidiaries in a manner consistent with the Covington Letter Ruling.

Third, the rent attributable to the personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property must not be greater than 15% of the total rent
received under the lease. The rent attributable to personal property under a lease is the amount that bears the same ratio to total rent under the lease for
the taxable year as the average of the fair market values of the leased personal property at the beginning and at the end of the taxable year bears to the
average of the aggregate fair market values of both the real and personal property covered by the lease at the beginning and at the end of such taxable
year (the “personal property ratio”). With respect to each of our leases, we believe that the personal property ratio generally will be less than 15%.
Where that is not, or may in the future not be, the case, we believe that any income attributable to personal property will not jeopardize our ability to
qualify as a REIT. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS would not challenge our calculation of a personal property ratio, or that a court
would not uphold such assertion. If such a challenge were successfully asserted, we could fail to satisfy the 75% or 95% gross income test and thus lose
our REIT status.

Fourth, we cannot furnish or render noncustomary services to the tenants of our facilities, or manage or operate our facilities, other than through
an independent contractor who is adequately compensated and from whom we do not derive or receive any income. However, we need not provide
services through an “independent contractor”, but instead may provide services directly to our tenants, if the services are “usually or customarily
rendered” in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not considered to be provided for the tenants’ convenience. In addition, we
may provide a minimal amount of “noncustomary” services to the tenants of a facility, other than through an independent contractor, as long as our
income from the services does not exceed 1% of our income from the related facility (though any income attributable to such services would not qualify
as rent for either the 75% or the 95% gross income tests). Finally, we may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries, which
may provide noncustomary services to our tenants without tainting our rents from the related facilities. We do not intend to perform any services other
than customary services for our tenants, and services provided through independent contractors or taxable REIT subsidiaries. We have represented to
Baker Donelson that we will not perform noncustomary services which would jeopardize our REIT status.

Finally, in order for the rent payable under the leases of our properties to constitute “rents from real property”, the leases must be respected as true
leases for federal income tax purposes and not treated as service contracts, joint ventures, financing arrangements, or another type of arrangement. We
generally treat our leases with respect to our properties as true leases for federal income tax purposes; however, there can be no assurance that the IRS
would not consider a particular lease a financing arrangement instead of a true lease for federal income tax purposes. In that case, and in any case in
which we intentionally structure a lease as a financing arrangement, our income from that lease would be interest income rather than rent and would be
qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test to the extent that our “loan” does not exceed the fair market value of the real estate assets
associated with the facility. All of the interest income from our loan would be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. We believe
that the characterization of a lease as a financing arrangement would not adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.

If a portion of the rent we receive from a facility does not qualify as “rents from real property” because the rent attributable to personal property
exceeds 15% of the total rent for a taxable year, the portion of the rent attributable to personal property will not be qualifying income for purposes of
either the 75% or 95% gross income test. Thus, if rent attributable to personal property, plus any other income that is nonqualifying income for purposes
of the 95% gross income test, during a taxable year exceeds 5% of our gross income during the year,

33


-----

we would lose our REIT status. By contrast, in the following circumstances, none of the rent from a lease of a facility would qualify as “rents from real
property”: (1) the rent is considered based on the income or profits of the tenant; (2) the tenant is a related party tenant and fails to qualify for the
exception to the related-party tenant rule for qualifying taxable REIT subsidiaries; (3) we furnish more than a de minimis amount of noncustomary
services to the tenants of the facility, other than through a qualifying independent contractor or a taxable REIT subsidiary; or (4) for health care facilities
or lodging facilities, we manage or operate the facility, other than through an independent contractor. In any of these circumstances, we could lose our
REIT status because we would be unable to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income test.

Tenants may be required to pay, besides base rent, reimbursements for certain amounts we are obligated to pay to third parties (such as a tenant’s
proportionate share of a facility’s operational or capital expenses), penalties for nonpayment or late payment of rent or additions to rent. These and other
similar payments should qualify as “rents from real property”.

_Interest. The term “interest” generally does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of the amount_
depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the
term “interest” solely because it is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. Furthermore, to the extent that interest from a loan
that is based upon the residual cash proceeds from the sale of the property securing the loan constitutes a “shared appreciation provision”, income
attributable to such participation feature will be treated as gain from the sale of the secured property.

_Fee Income. We may receive various fees in connection with our operations. The fees will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and_
95% gross income tests if they are received in consideration for entering into an agreement to make a loan secured by real property and the fees are not
determined by income and profits. Other fees are not qualifying income for purposes of either gross income test. We anticipate that MPT TRS, one of
our taxable REIT subsidiaries, will receive most of the management fees, inspection fees and construction fees in connection with our operations. Any
fees earned by MPT TRS will not be included as income for purposes of the gross income tests.

_Prohibited Transactions. A REIT will incur a 100% tax on the net income derived from any sale or other disposition of property, other than_
foreclosure property, that the REIT holds primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. We believe that none of our assets
will be held primarily for sale to customers and that a sale of any of our assets will not be in the ordinary course of our business. Whether a REIT holds
an asset “primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business” depends, however, on the facts and circumstances in effect from
time to time, including those related to a particular asset. Nevertheless, we will attempt to comply with the terms of safe-harbor provisions in the federal
income tax laws prescribing when an asset sale will not be characterized as a prohibited transaction. We cannot assure you, however, that we can comply
with the safe-harbor provisions or that we will avoid owning property that may be characterized as property that we hold “primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business”. We may use a taxable REIT subsidiary to engage in transactions that may not fall within the
safe-harbor provisions.

_Foreclosure Property. We will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any income from foreclosure property, other than income that_
otherwise would be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, less expenses directly connected with the production of that income.
However, gross income from foreclosure property will qualify under the 75% and 95% gross income tests. Foreclosure property is any real property,
including interests in real property, and any personal property incidental to such real property acquired by a REIT as the result of the REIT’s having bid
on the property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced such property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after actual or
imminent default on a lease of the property or on indebtedness secured by the property, or a “Repossession Action”. Property acquired by a
Repossession Action will not be considered “foreclosure property” if (1) the REIT held or acquired the property

34


-----

subject to a lease or securing indebtedness for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or (2) the lease or loan was acquired or entered into
with intent to take Repossession Action or in circumstances where the REIT had reason to know a default would occur. The determination of such intent
or reason to know must be based on all relevant facts and circumstances. In no case will property be considered “foreclosure property” unless the REIT
makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property.

Foreclosure property includes any qualified health care property acquired by a REIT as a result of a termination of a lease of such property
(regardless of whether such termination relates to a default, or the imminence of a default, on the lease). A “qualified health care property” means any
real property, including interests in real property, and any personal property incident to such real property which is a “health care facility” (as defined
above under “—Requirements for Qualification—Organizational Requirements”) or is necessary or incidental to the use of a health care facility.

However, a REIT will not be considered to have foreclosed on a property where the REIT takes control of the property as a
mortgagee-in-possession and cannot receive any profit or sustain any loss except as a creditor of the mortgagor. Property generally ceases to be
foreclosure property at the end of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the REIT acquired the property (or, in the case of a qualified
health care property which becomes foreclosure property because it is acquired by a REIT as a result of the termination of a lease of such property, at the
end of the second taxable year following the taxable year in which the REIT acquired such property) or longer if an extension is granted by the Secretary
of the Treasury. This period (as extended, if applicable) terminates, and foreclosure property ceases to be foreclosure property on the first day:

    - on which a lease is entered into for the property that, by its terms, will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the 75%

gross income test, or any amount is received or accrued, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will
give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test;

    - on which any construction takes place on the property, other than completion of a building or any other improvement, where more than 10%

of the construction was completed before default became imminent; or

    - which is more than 90 days after the day on which the REIT acquired the property and the property is used in a trade or business which is

conducted by the REIT, other than through an independent contractor from whom the REIT itself does not derive or receive any income. For
this purpose, in the case of a qualified health care property, income derived or received from an independent contractor will be disregarded
to the extent such income is attributable to (1) a lease of property in effect on the date the REIT acquired the qualified health care property
(without regard to its renewal after such date so long as such renewal is pursuant to the terms of such lease as in effect on such date) or
(2) any lease of property entered into after such date if, on such date, a lease of such property from the REIT was in effect and, under the
terms of the new lease, the REIT receives a substantially similar or lesser benefit in comparison to the prior lease.

_Hedging Transactions. From time to time, we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Our_
hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, options to purchase such items, and futures and forward contracts.
Income and gain from “hedging transactions” is excluded from gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test and the 75% gross income test.
For this purpose, a “hedging transaction” will mean any transaction (i) entered into in the normal course of our trade or business primarily to manage the
risk of interest rate or price changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or
carry real estate assets; (ii) entered into primarily to manage risks of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be
qualifying income under the 75% or 95% income tests (or any property which generates such income or gain) ; or (iii) for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2015, that hedges against transactions described in clause (i) or (ii) and is entered into in connection with the extinguishment of debt or
sale of property that is being hedged against by the transaction described in clause (i) or (ii). We are required to clearly identify

35


-----

any such hedging transaction before the close of the day on which it is acquired, originated, or entered into, subject, for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2015, to certain curative provisions. Since the financial markets continually introduce new and innovative instruments related to risksharing or trading, it is not entirely clear which such instruments will generate income which will be considered qualifying or excluded income for
purposes of the gross income tests. We intend to structure any hedging or similar transactions so as not to jeopardize our status as a REIT.

_Foreign Currency Gain. Passive foreign exchange gain is excluded from the 95% income test and real estate foreign exchange gain is excluded_
from the 75% income test. Real estate foreign exchange gain is foreign currency gain (as defined in Code Section 988(b)(1)) which is attributable to
(i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 75% income test, (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations secured by mortgages on
real property or interests in real property; or (iii) becoming or being the obligor under obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests
in real property. Real estate foreign exchange gain also includes Code Section 987 gain attributable to a qualified business unit (“QBU”) of the REIT if
the QBU itself meets the 75% income test for the taxable year, and meets the 75% asset test at the close of each quarter of the REIT that has directly or
indirectly held the QBU. The QBU is not required to meet the 95% income test in order for this 987 gain exclusion to apply. Real estate foreign
exchange gain also includes any other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

Passive foreign exchange gain includes all real estate foreign exchange gain, and in addition includes foreign currency gain which is attributable to
(i) any qualifying item of income or gain for purposes of the 95% income test, (ii) the acquisition or ownership of obligations, (iii) becoming or being
the obligor under obligations, and (iv) any other foreign currency gain as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

Any gain derived from dealing, or engaging in substantial and regular trading, in securities denominated in, or determined by reference to, one or
more nonfunctional currencies will be treated as non-qualifying income for both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. We do not currently, and do not
expect to, engage in such trading.

_Failure to Satisfy Gross Income Tests. If we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year, we nevertheless may qualify_
as a REIT for that year if we qualify for relief under certain provisions of the federal income tax laws. Those relief provisions generally will be available
if:

    - our failure to meet those tests is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, and

    - following our identification of such failure for any taxable year, a schedule of the sources of our income is filed in accordance with

regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.

We cannot with certainty predict whether any failure to meet these tests will qualify for the relief provisions. As discussed above in “—Taxation of
Our Company”, even if the relief provisions apply, we would incur a 100% tax on the gross income attributable to the greater of the amounts by which
we fail the 75% and 95% gross income tests, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability.

_Asset Tests. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we also must satisfy the following asset tests at the end of each quarter of each taxable year._

First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must consist of:

    - cash or cash items, including certain receivables;

    - government securities;

    - real estate assets, which includes interest in real property, leaseholds, options to acquire real property or leaseholds, interests in mortgages on

real property, shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other REITs, and, for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs and interests in mortgages on interests in real property; and

36


-----

    - investments in stock or debt instruments attributable to the temporary investment (i.e., for a period not exceeding 12 months) of new capital

that we raise through any equity offering or public offering of debt with at least a five year term.

Effective for tax years beginning after July 30, 2008, if a REIT or its QBU uses any foreign currency as its functional currency (as defined in
section 985(b) of the Code), the term “cash” includes such currency to the extent held for use in the normal course of the activities of the REIT or QBU
which give rise to items of income or gain qualifying under the 95% and 75% income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets
qualifying under the 75% assets test, provided that the currency cannot be held in connection with dealing, or engaging in substantial and regular
trading, in securities.

With respect to investments not included in the 75% asset class, we may not hold securities of any one issuer (other than a taxable REIT
subsidiary) that exceed 5% of the value of our total assets; nor may we hold securities of any one issuer (other than a taxable REIT subsidiary) that
represent more than 10% of the voting power of all outstanding voting securities of such issuer or more than 10% of the value of all outstanding
securities of such issuer.

In addition, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, we may not hold securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries that
represent in the aggregate more than 25% of the value of our total assets and, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, we may not hold
securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 20% of the value of our total assets, in all cases
irrespective of whether such securities may also be included in the 75% asset class (e.g., a mortgage loan issued to a taxable REIT subsidiary). For
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, we may not hold debt instruments (other than debt secured by interests in real property) issued by
publicly offered REITs that represent in the aggregate more than 25% of the value of our total assets. Furthermore, no more than 25% of our total assets
may be represented by securities that are not included in the 75% asset class, including, among other things, certain securities of a taxable REIT
subsidiary such as stock or non-mortgage debt.

For purposes of the 5% and 10% asset tests, the term “securities” does not include stock in another REIT, equity or debt securities of a qualified
REIT subsidiary or taxable REIT subsidiary, mortgage loans that constitute real estate assets, or equity interests in a partnership to the extent that the
partnership holds real estate assets. The term “securities”, however, generally includes debt securities issued by a partnership or another REIT, except
that for purposes of the 10% value test, the term “securities” does not include:

    - “Straight debt”, defined as a written unconditional promise to pay on demand or on a specified date a sum certain in money if (1) the debt is

not convertible, directly or indirectly, into stock, and (2) the interest rate and interest payment dates are not contingent on profits, the
borrower’s discretion, or similar factors. “Straight debt” securities do not include any securities issued by a partnership or a corporation in
which we or any controlled TRS (i.e., a TRS in which we own directly or indirectly more than 50% of the voting power or value of the
stock) holds non- “straight debt” securities that have an aggregate value of more than 1% of the issuer’s outstanding securities. However,
“straight debt” securities include debt subject to the following contingencies:

         - a contingency relating to the time of payment of interest or principal, as long as either (1) there is no change to the effective yield to

maturity of the debt obligation, other than a change to the annual yield to maturity that does not exceed the greater of 0.25% or 5%
of the annual yield to maturity, or (2) neither the aggregate issue price nor the aggregate face amount of the issuer’s debt obligations
held by us exceeds $1 million and no more than 12 months of unaccrued interest on the debt obligations can be required to be
prepaid;

         - a contingency relating to the time or amount of payment upon a default or exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt

obligation, as long as the contingency is consistent with customary commercial practice;

37


-----

    - Any loan to an individual or an estate;

    - Any “Section 467 rental agreement”, other than an agreement with a related party tenant;

    - Any obligation to pay “rents from real property”;

    - Any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government or any political

subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but only if the determination of any payment thereunder does not depend in
whole or in part on the profits of any entity not described in this paragraph or payments on any obligation issued by an entity not described
in this paragraph;

    - Any security issued by a REIT;

    - Any debt instrument of an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes to the extent of our interest as a partner in the

partnership; and

    - Any debt instrument of an entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes not described in the preceding bullet points if at

least 75% of the partnership’s gross income, excluding income from prohibited transactions, is qualifying income for purposes of the 75%
gross income test described above in “—Requirements for Qualification—Gross Income Tests”.

For purposes of the 10% value test, our proportionate share of the assets of a partnership is our proportionate interest in any securities issued by
the partnership, excluding all securities described above except those securities described in the last two bullet points above.

MPT TRS has made and will make, and prior to its dissolution in 2016, MPT Covington TRS made, loans to tenants to acquire operations and for
other purposes. If the IRS were to successfully treat a particular loan to a tenant as an equity interest in the tenant, the tenant would be a “related party
tenant” with respect to our company and the rent that we receive from the tenant would not be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income
tests. As a result, we could lose our REIT status. In addition, if the IRS were to successfully treat a particular loan as an interest held by our operating
partnership rather than by one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries we could fail the 5% asset test, and if the IRS further successfully treated the loan as
other than straight debt, we could fail the 10% asset test with respect to such interest. As a result of the failure of either test, we could lose our REIT
status.

We have structured transactions in which MPT TRS owns an indirect equity interest in a tenant entity in a manner consistent with the Covington
Letter Ruling, including leases with the subsidiaries of Ernest. If the IRS successfully challenged the taxable REIT subsidiary status of MPT TRS, and
we were unable to cure as described below, we could fail the 10% asset test with respect to our ownership of MPT TRS and as a result lose our REIT
status.

We will monitor the status of our assets for purposes of the various asset tests and will manage our portfolio in order to comply at all times with
such tests. If we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, we will not lose our REIT status if:

    - we satisfied the asset tests at the end of the preceding calendar quarter; and

    - the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset test requirements arose from changes in the market values of our assets and

was not wholly or partly caused by the acquisition of one or more non-qualifying assets.

If we did not satisfy the condition described in the second item above, we still could avoid disqualification by eliminating any discrepancy within
30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose.

In the event that, at the end of any calendar quarter, we violate the 5% or 10% test described above, we will not lose our REIT status if (1) the
failure is de minimis (up to the lesser of 1% of our assets or $10 million) and

38


-----

(2) we dispose of assets or otherwise comply with the asset tests within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identified the failure of
the asset test. In the event of a more than de minimis failure of the 5% or 10% tests, or a failure of the other assets test, at the end of any calendar
quarter, as long as the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, we will not lose our REIT status if we (1) file with the IRS a
schedule describing the assets that caused the failure, (2) dispose of assets or otherwise comply with the asset tests within six months after the last day of
the quarter in which we identified the failure of the asset test and (3) pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 and tax at the highest corporate rate on the
net income from the nonqualifying assets during the period in which we failed to satisfy the asset tests.

_Distribution Requirements. Each taxable year, we must distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends and deemed distributions of retained_
capital gain, to our stockholders in an aggregate amount not less than:

    - the sum of:

         - 90% of our “REIT taxable income”, computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or our net capital gain or loss; and

         - 90% of our after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property;

    - Minus

         - the sum of certain items of non-cash income.

We must pay such distributions in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if we declare the distribution before we
timely file our federal income tax return for the year and pay the distribution on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration.

We will pay federal income tax on taxable income, including net capital gain, that we do not distribute to stockholders. In addition, we will incur a
4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of a specified required distribution over amounts we actually distribute if we distribute an amount less than
the required distribution during a calendar year, or by the end of January following the calendar year in the case of distributions with declaration and
record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year. The required distribution must not be less than the sum of:

    - 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year;

    - 95% of our REIT capital gain income for the year; and

    - any undistributed taxable income from prior periods.

We may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long-term capital gain we receive in a taxable year. See “—Requirements for Qualification—
Taxation of Taxable United States Stockholders”. If we so elect, we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount for purposes of the
4% excise tax described above. We intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements and to avoid corporate
income tax and the 4% excise tax.

It is possible that, from time to time, we may experience timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible
expenses and the inclusion of that income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our REIT taxable income. For example, we may not deduct
recognized capital losses from our “REIT taxable income”. Further, it is possible that, from time to time, we may be allocated a share of net capital gain
attributable to the sale of depreciated property that exceeds our allocable share of cash attributable to that sale. Under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act (the “Act”), we generally will be required to take certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain
financial statements. The application of this rule may require the accrual of income with respect to certain debt instruments or mortgage-backed
securities, such as original issue discount or market discount, earlier than would be the case under the

39


-----

general tax rules, although the precise application of this rule is unclear at this time. This rule generally will be effective for tax years beginning after
December 31, 2017 or, for debt instruments or mortgage-backed securities issued with original issue discount, for tax years beginning after
December 31, 2018. As a result of the foregoing, we may have less cash than is necessary to distribute all of our taxable income and thereby avoid
corporate income tax and the excise tax imposed on certain undistributed income. In such a situation, we may need to borrow funds or issue additional
shares of common or preferred stock.

Under certain circumstances, we may be able to correct a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends”
to our stockholders in a later year. We may include such deficiency dividends in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. Although we may
be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, we will be required to pay interest based upon the amount of any deduction
we take for deficiency dividends.

_Recordkeeping Requirements. We must maintain certain records in order to qualify as a REIT. In addition, to avoid paying a penalty, we must_
request on an annual basis information from our stockholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of our shares of outstanding capital stock. We
intend to comply with these requirements.

_Failure to Qualify. If we failed to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and no relief provision applied, we would have the following_
consequences. We would be subject to federal income tax and, for tax year beginning prior to January 1, 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax
at rates applicable to regular C corporations on our taxable income, determined without reduction for amounts distributed to stockholders. We would not
be required to make any distributions to stockholders, and any distributions to stockholders would be taxable to them as dividend income to the extent of
our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Corporate stockholders could be eligible for a dividends-received deduction if certain conditions are
satisfied. Unless we qualified for relief under specific statutory provisions, we would not be permitted to elect taxation as a REIT for the four taxable
years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT.

If we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification, other than the gross income tests and the asset tests, we could avoid
disqualification if the failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. In addition,
there are relief provisions for a failure of the gross income tests and asset tests, as described above in “—Gross Income Tests” and “—Asset Tests”.

**Other Tax Consequences**

_Tax Aspects of Our Investments in Our Operating Partnership. The following discussion summarizes certain federal income tax considerations_
applicable to our direct or indirect investment in our operating partnership and any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability companies we form or
acquire, each individually referred to as a “Partnership” and collectively, as “Partnerships”. The following discussion does not cover state or local tax
laws or any federal tax laws other than income tax laws.

Classification as Partnerships. We are entitled to include in our income our distributive share of each Partnership’s income and to deduct our
distributive share of each Partnership’s losses only if each Partnership is classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership (or an entity that is
disregarded for federal income tax purposes if the entity has only one owner or member), rather than as a corporation or an association taxable as a
corporation. An organization with at least two owners or members will be classified as a partnership, rather than as a corporation, for federal income tax
purposes if it:

    - is treated as a partnership under the Treasury regulations relating to entity classification (the “check-the-box regulations”); and

    - is not a “publicly traded” partnership.

40


-----

Under the check-the-box regulations, an unincorporated entity with at least two owners or members may elect to be classified either as an
association taxable as a corporation or as a partnership. If such an entity does not make an election, it generally will be treated as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes. We intend that each Partnership will be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes (or else a disregarded
entity where there are not at least two separate beneficial owners).

A publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary
market (or a substantial equivalent). A publicly traded partnership is generally treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, but will not be
so treated for any taxable year for which at least 90% of the partnership’s gross income consists of specified passive income, including real property
rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, interest, and dividends (the “90% passive income exception”).

Treasury regulations, referred to as PTP regulations, provide limited safe harbors from treatment as a publicly traded partnership. Pursuant to one
of those safe harbors, the “private placement exclusion”, interests in a partnership will not be treated as readily tradable on a secondary market or the
substantial equivalent thereof if (1) all interests in the partnership were issued in a transaction or transactions that were not required to be registered
under the Securities Act, and (2) the partnership does not have more than 100 partners at any time during the partnership’s taxable year. For the
determination of the number of partners in a partnership, a person owning an interest in a partnership, grantor trust, or S corporation that owns an
interest in the partnership is treated as a partner in the partnership only if (1) substantially all of the value of the owner’s interest in the entity is
attributable to the entity’s direct or indirect interest in the partnership and (2) a principal purpose of the use of the entity is to permit the partnership to
satisfy the 100-partner limitation. We expect that each Partnership would qualify for the private placement exclusion.

An unincorporated entity with only one separate beneficial owner generally may elect to be classified either as an association taxable as a
corporation or as a disregarded entity. If such an entity is domestic and does not make an election, it generally will be treated as a disregarded entity. A
disregarded entity’s activities are treated as those of a branch or division of its beneficial owner.

The operating partnership has not elected to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation. Therefore, our operating partnership is treated as
a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We intend that our operating partnership will continue to be treated as partnership for federal income tax
purposes.

We have not requested, and do not intend to request, a ruling from the IRS that the operating partnership or any other subsidiary entity will be
classified as either a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes. If for any reason any Partnership were taxable as a corporation,
rather than as a partnership or a disregarded entity, for federal income tax purposes, we likely would not be able to qualify as a REIT. See “—
Requirements for Qualification—Gross Income Tests” and “—Requirements for Qualification—Asset Tests”. In addition, any change in a Partnership’s
status for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event, in which case we might incur tax liability without any related cash distribution. See “—
Requirements for Qualification—Distribution Requirements”. Further, items of income and deduction of such Partnership would not pass through to its
partners, and its partners would be treated as stockholders for tax purposes. Consequently, such Partnership would be required to pay income tax at
corporate rates on its net income, and distributions to its partners would constitute dividends that would not be deductible in computing such
Partnership’s taxable income.

**_Income Taxation of the Partnerships and Their Partners_**

_Partners, Not the Partnerships, Subject to Tax. A partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes. If each Partnership is_
classified as a partnership, we will therefore take into account our allocable share of each such Partnership’s income, gains, losses, deductions, and
credits for each taxable year of each Partnership ending with or within our taxable year, even if we receive no distribution from any Partnership for that
year or a

41


-----

distribution less than our share of taxable income. Similarly, even if we receive a distribution, it may not be taxable if the distribution does not exceed
our adjusted tax basis in our interest in the Partnership. If any Partnership is classified as a disregarded entity, each Partnership’s activities will be treated
as if carried on directly by us.

_Partnership Allocations. Although a partnership agreement generally will determine the allocation of income and losses among partners,_
allocations will be disregarded for tax purposes if they do not comply with the provisions of the federal income tax laws governing partnership
allocations. If an allocation is not recognized for federal income tax purposes, the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with
the partners’ interests in the partnership, which will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic
arrangement of the partners with respect to such item. Each Partnership’s allocations of taxable income, gain, and loss are intended to comply with the
requirements of the federal income tax laws governing partnership allocations.

_Tax Allocations with Respect to Contributed Properties. Income, gain, loss, and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that_
is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated in a manner such that the contributing partner is charged
with, or benefits from, respectively, the unrealized gain or unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution. Similar rules apply
with respect to property revalued on the books of a partnership. The amount of such unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as built-in gain or
built-in loss, is generally equal to the difference between the fair market value of the contributed or revalued property at the time of contribution or
revaluation and the adjusted tax basis of such property at that time, referred to as a book-tax difference. Such allocations are solely for federal income
tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners. The United States Treasury
Department has issued regulations requiring partnerships to use a “reasonable method” for allocating items with respect to which there is a book-tax
difference and outlining several reasonable allocation methods. Our operating partnership generally intends to use the traditional method for allocating
items with respect to which there is a book-tax difference.

_Basis in Partnership Interest. Our adjusted tax basis in any partnership interest we own generally will be:_

    - the amount of cash and the basis of any other property we contribute to the partnership;

    - increased by our allocable share of the partnership’s income (including tax-exempt income) and our allocable share of indebtedness of the

partnership; and

    - reduced, but not below zero, by our allocable share of the partnership’s loss, the amount of cash and the basis of property distributed to us,

and constructive distributions resulting from a reduction in our share of indebtedness of the partnership.

Loss allocated to us in excess of our basis in a partnership interest will not be taken into account until we again have basis sufficient to absorb the
loss. A reduction of our share of partnership indebtedness will be treated as a constructive cash distribution to us, and will reduce our adjusted tax basis.
Distributions, including constructive distributions, in excess of the basis of our partnership interest will constitute taxable income to us. Such
distributions and constructive distributions normally will be characterized as long-term capital gain.

_Partnership Audits. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, in the event of a federal income tax audit the Partnership, rather than the_
Partnership’s partners, could be liable for the payment of certain taxes, including interest and penalties, or the partners could be liable for the tax but be
required to pay interest at a higher rate than would otherwise apply to underpayments. Furthermore, the “partnership representative” of the Partnership
will have exclusive authority to bind all partners to any federal income tax proceeding.

_Depreciation Deductions Available to Partnerships. The initial tax basis of property is the amount of cash and the basis of property given as_
consideration for the property. A partnership in which we are a partner

42


-----

generally will depreciate property for federal income tax purposes under the modified accelerated cost recovery system of depreciation, referred to as
MACRS. Under MACRS, each Partnership generally will depreciate furnishings over a seven year recovery period and equipment over a five year
recovery period using a 200% declining balance method and a half-year convention. If, however, the partnership places more than 40% of its furnishings
and equipment in service during the last three months of a taxable year, a mid-quarter depreciation convention must be used for the furnishings and
equipment placed in service during that year. Under MACRS, the partnership generally will depreciate buildings and improvements over a 39 year
recovery period using a straight line method and a mid-month convention. Each Partnership’s initial basis in properties acquired solely in exchange for
units of each Partnership should be the same as the transferor’s basis in such properties on the date of acquisition by the partnership. Although the law is
not entirely clear, each Partnership generally will depreciate such property for federal income tax purposes over the same remaining useful lives and
under the same methods used by the transferors. Each Partnership’s tax depreciation deductions will be allocated among the partners in accordance with
their respective interests in the partnership, except to the extent that any Partnership is required under the federal income tax laws governing partnership
allocations to use a method for allocating tax depreciation deductions attributable to contributed or revalued properties that results in our receiving a
disproportionate share of such deductions.

_Sale of a Partnership’s Property. Generally, any gain realized by a Partnership on the sale of property held for more than one year will be long-_
term capital gain, except for any portion of the gain treated as depreciation or cost recovery recapture. Any gain or loss recognized by a Partnership on
the disposition of contributed or revalued properties will be allocated first to the partners who contributed the properties or who were partners at the time
of revaluation, to the extent of their built-in gain or loss on those properties for federal income tax purposes. The partners’ built-in gain or loss on
contributed or revalued properties is the difference between the partners’ proportionate share of the book value of those properties and the partners’ tax
basis allocable to those properties at the time of the contribution or revaluation. Any remaining gain or loss recognized by the Partnership on the
disposition of contributed or revalued properties, and any gain or loss recognized by the Partnership on the disposition of other properties, will be
allocated among the partners in accordance with the Partnership’s allocation provisions (subject to the restrictions described above).

Our share of any Partnership gain from the sale of inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of each
Partnership’s trade or business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% tax. Income from a prohibited transaction may
have an adverse effect on our ability to satisfy the gross income tests for REIT status. See “—Requirements for Qualification—Gross Income Tests”. We
do not presently intend to acquire or hold, or to allow any Partnership to acquire or hold, any property that is likely to be treated as inventory or property
held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our, or any Partnership’s, trade or business.

_Taxable REIT Subsidiaries. As described above, we have formed and have made a timely election to treat MPT TRS and MPT Finance_
Corporation as taxable REIT subsidiaries and may form or acquire additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. A taxable REIT subsidiary may
provide services to our tenants and engage in activities unrelated to our tenants, such as third-party management, development, and other independent
business activities.

We and any corporate subsidiary in which we own stock, other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, must make an election for the subsidiary to be
treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a taxable REIT subsidiary directly or indirectly owns shares of a corporation with more than 35% of the value or
voting power of all outstanding shares of the corporation, the corporation will automatically also be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Prior to our
disposition of our investment in the operations of Ernest and Capella, Ernest, Capella, and their respective corporate subsidiaries were automatically
treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries under this rule. For tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, no more than 25% of the value of our assets may
consist of securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries and for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, no more than 20% of the
value of our assets may consist of securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries, irrespective of whether such

43


-----

securities may also qualify under the 75% assets test, and no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of the securities that are not
qualifying assets under the 75% test, including, among other things, certain securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary, such as stock or non-mortgage debt.

Rent we receive from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will qualify as “rents from real property” as long as at least 90% of the leased space in the
property is leased to persons other than taxable REIT subsidiaries and related party tenants, and the amount paid by the taxable REIT subsidiary to rent
space at the property is substantially comparable to rents paid by other tenants of the property for comparable space. Rents paid to a REIT by a taxable
REIT subsidiary with respect to a “qualified health care property”, (as defined above under “—Requirements for Qualification—Foreclosure Property”)
operated on behalf of such taxable REIT subsidiary by a person who is an “eligible independent contractor”, (as defined above under “—Requirements
for Qualification—Organizational Requirements”) are qualifying rental income for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests. The taxable REIT
subsidiary rules impose a 100% excise tax on certain types of transactions between a taxable REIT subsidiary and us or our tenants that are not
conducted on an arm’s-length basis.

A taxable REIT subsidiary may not directly or indirectly operate or manage a “health care facility”, (as defined above under “—Requirements for
Qualification—Organizational Requirements”) though a health care facility leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary from a REIT may be operated on behalf
of the taxable REIT subsidiary by an eligible independent contractor. We have structured transactions in which MPT TRS owns an indirect equity
interest in a manner consistent with the Covington Letter Ruling, and may structure other such transactions in the future.

_State and Local Taxes. We and our stockholders may be subject to taxation by various states and localities, including those in which we or a_
stockholder transact business, own property or reside. The state and local tax treatment may differ from the federal income tax treatment described
above. Consequently, stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws upon an investment in our
common stock.

**Taxation of Our Stockholders**

_Taxation of Taxable United States Stockholders. As long as we qualify as a REIT, a taxable “United States stockholder” will be required to take_
into account as ordinary income distributions made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits that we do not designate as capital gain
dividends or retained long-term capital gain. A United States stockholder will not qualify for the dividends-received deduction generally available to
corporations. The term “United States stockholder” means a holder of shares of common stock that, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:

    - a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation or partnership (including an entity treated as a corporation or partnership for United States federal income tax purposes)

created or organized under the laws of the United States or of a political subdivision of the United States;

    - an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - any trust if (1) a United States court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more United

States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a United
States person.

For individuals with taxable income in excess of certain thresholds, the maximum federal income tax rate on ordinary income is 37% and the
maximum rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income is 20%. Estates and trusts have separate tax rate schedules.

_Distributions. Distributions paid to a United States stockholder will generally not qualify for the maximum 20% tax rate in effect for “qualified_
dividend income.” Qualified dividend income generally includes dividends

44


-----

paid by domestic C corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations to most United States noncorporate stockholders. As long as we qualify as a
REIT, our dividends generally will not be eligible for the current preferred rates on qualified dividend income. As a result, our ordinary REIT dividends
will continue to be taxed at the higher tax rate applicable to ordinary income. Currently, the highest marginal individual income tax rate on ordinary
income is 37%. However, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct 20% of dividends from a REIT, other than capital
gains dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026,
subject to certain limitations. Furthermore, the 20% maximum tax rate for qualified dividend income will apply to our ordinary REIT dividends, if any,
that are (1) attributable to dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations, such as our taxable REIT subsidiaries, and (2) attributable to income
upon which we have paid corporate income tax (e.g., to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income). In general, to qualify for the
reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, a stockholder must hold our common stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning
on the date that is 60 days before the date on which our common stock becomes ex-dividend.

Distributions to a United States stockholder which we designate as capital gain dividends will generally be treated as long-term capital gain,
without regard to the period for which the United States stockholder has held its common stock. With certain limitations, capital gain dividends received
by an individual U.S. stockholder may be eligible for preferential rates of taxation. U.S. stockholders that are corporations, may, however, be required to
treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income. In addition, certain net capital gains attributable to depreciable real property held
for more than 12 months are subject to a 25% maximum federal income tax rate to the extent of previously claimed real property depreciation.

The amount of dividends we designate as qualified dividends and capital gain dividends with respect to any taxable year may not exceed the
dividends we pay with respect to such year.

We may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long-term capital gain that we receive in a taxable year. In that case, a United States
stockholder would be taxed on its proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain. The United States stockholder would receive a credit
or refund for its proportionate share of the tax we paid. The United States stockholder would increase the basis in its shares of common stock by the
amount of its proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain, minus its share of the tax we paid.

A United States stockholder will not incur tax on a distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits if the distribution
does not exceed the adjusted basis of the United States stockholder’s shares. Instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the shares, and any
amount in excess of both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the adjusted basis will be treated as capital gain, long-term if the shares
have been held for more than one year, provided the shares are a capital asset in the hands of the United States stockholder. In addition, any distribution
we declare in October, November, or December of any year that is payable to a United States stockholder of record on a specified date in any of those
months will be treated as paid by us and received by the United States stockholder on December 31 of the year, provided we actually pay the distribution
during January of the following calendar year.

Stockholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses. Instead, these losses are
generally carried over by us for potential offset against our future income. Taxable distributions from us and gain from the disposition of shares of
common stock will not be treated as passive activity income; stockholders generally will not be able to apply any “passive activity losses,” such as
losses from certain types of limited partnerships in which the stockholder is a limited partner, against such income. In addition, taxable distributions
from us and gain from the disposition of common stock generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest
limitations. We will notify stockholders after the close of our taxable year as to the portions of the distributions attributable to that year that constitute
ordinary income, return of capital, and capital gain.

_Taxation of United States Stockholders on the Disposition of Shares of Common Stock. In general, a United States stockholder who is not a dealer_
in securities must treat any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of our shares of common stock as long-term capital gain or loss if the United
States stockholder has held the stock for more than one year, and otherwise as short-term capital gain or loss. However, a United States stockholder must
treat any loss upon a sale or exchange of common stock held for six months or less as a long-term capital loss to the extent of capital gain dividends and
any other actual or deemed distributions from us which the United States stockholder treats as long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any loss that a
United States stockholder realizes upon a taxable disposition of common stock may be disallowed if the United States stockholder purchases other
shares of our common stock within 30 days before or after the disposition.

_Capital Gains and Losses. The tax-rate differential between capital gain and ordinary income for non-corporate taxpayers may be significant. A_
taxpayer generally must hold a capital asset for more than one year for gain or loss derived from its sale or exchange to be treated as long-term capital
gain or loss. The highest marginal individual income tax rate is currently 37%. The maximum tax rate on long-term capital gain applicable to individuals
is generally 20%. The maximum tax rate on long-term capital gain from the sale or exchange of “section 1250 property” (i.e., generally, depreciable real
property) is 25% to the extent of certain “unrecaptured section 1250 gain”. We generally may designate whether a distribution we designate as a capital
gain dividend (and any retained capital gain that we are deemed to distribute) is long-term capital gain or “unrecaptured section 1250 gain”.

The characterization of income as capital gain or ordinary income may affect the deductibility of losses. A non-corporate taxpayer may deduct
from its ordinary income capital losses not offset by capital gains only up to a maximum of $3,000 annually. A non-corporate taxpayer may carry
forward unused capital losses indefinitely. A corporate taxpayer must pay tax on its net capital gain at corporate ordinary income rates. A corporate
taxpayer may deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains and unused losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years.

Certain United States individuals, estates, and trusts with taxable incomes in excess of certain thresholds will be subject to an additional 3.8% tax
on their net investment income.

_Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding. We will report to our stockholders and to the IRS the amount of distributions we_
pay during each calendar year and the amount of tax we withhold, if any. A United States stockholder may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of
up to 24% with respect to distributions unless the holder:

    - is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact; or

    - provides a taxpayer identification number, certifies, under penalty of perjury, as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding, and

otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

A United States stockholder who does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by
the IRS. Any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the stockholder’s income tax liability. In addition, we may be required to
withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any stockholder who fails to certify its non-foreign status to us. United States stockholders should
consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualifications for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.

_Taxation of Tax-exempt Stockholders. Tax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual_
retirement accounts, referred to as pension trusts, generally are exempt from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
“unrelated business taxable income.” While many investments in real estate generate unrelated business taxable income, the IRS has issued a ruling that
dividend

46


-----

distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute unrelated business taxable income so long as the exempt employee
pension trust does not otherwise use the shares of the REIT in an unrelated trade or business of the pension trust. Based on that ruling, amounts we
distribute to tax-exempt stockholders generally should not constitute unrelated business taxable income. However, if a tax-exempt stockholder were to
finance its acquisition of common stock with debt, a portion of the income it received from us would constitute unrelated business taxable income
pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules. Furthermore, social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit
trusts and qualified group legal service plans that are exempt from taxation under special provisions of the federal income tax laws are subject to
different unrelated business taxable income rules, which generally will require them to characterize distributions they receive from us as unrelated
business taxable income. Finally, in certain circumstances, a qualified employee pension or profit sharing trust that owns more than 10% of our
outstanding stock must treat a percentage of the dividends it receives from us as unrelated business taxable income. The percentage is equal to the gross
income we derive from an unrelated trade or business, determined as if we were a pension trust, divided by our total gross income for the year in which
we pay the dividends. This rule applies to a pension trust holding more than 10% of our outstanding stock only if:

    - the percentage of our dividends which the tax-exempt trust must treat as unrelated business taxable income is at least 5%;

    - we qualify as a REIT by reason of the modification of the rule requiring that no more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock be owned

by five or fewer individuals, which modification allows the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding shares in proportion to
their actual interests in the pension trust; and

    - either of the following applies:

         - one pension trust owns more than 25% of the value of our outstanding stock; or

         - a group of pension trusts individually holding more than 10% of the value of our outstanding stock collectively owns more than 50%

of the value of our outstanding stock.

_Taxation of Non-United States Stockholders. This section is a summary of the rules governing the U.S. federal income taxation of non-U.S._
stockholders. The term “non-U.S. stockholder” means a holder of shares of our common stock that is not a U.S. stockholder, a partnership (or entity
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or a tax-exempt stockholder. The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of
nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships, and other foreign stockholders are complex. We urge non-U.S. stockholders to
consult their own tax advisors to determine the impact of U.S. federal, state, and local income tax laws on the purchase, ownership and disposition of
shares of our common stock, including any reporting requirements.

_Distributions to Non-United States Stockholders._

A non-U.S. stockholder that receives a distribution that is not attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of a “United States real property
interest,” or USRPI, as defined below, and that we do not designate as a capital gain dividend or retained capital gain will recognize ordinary income to
the extent that we pay such distribution out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. A withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of
the distribution ordinarily will apply to such distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates the tax. Under some treaties, lower
withholding rates on dividends do not apply, or do not apply as favorably, to dividends from REITs.

However, if a distribution is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S.
stockholder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the distribution at graduated rates, in the same manner as U.S. stockholders are taxed
with respect to such distribution, and a non-U.S. stockholder that is a corporation also may be subject to a 30% branch profits tax with

47


-----

respect to that distribution. The branch profits tax may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty. We plan to withhold U.S. income tax at the rate of 30% on
the gross amount of any such distribution paid to a non-U.S. stockholder unless either:

    - a lower treaty rate applies and the non-U.S. stockholder provides us with an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, evidencing

eligibility for that reduced rate;

    - the non-U.S. stockholder provides us with an IRS Form W-8ECI claiming that the distribution is effectively connected with the conduct of a

U.S. trade or business; or

    - the distribution is treated as attributable to a sale of a USRPI under FIRPTA (discussed below).

A non-U.S. stockholder will not incur tax on a distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits if the excess portion of
such distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the non-U.S. stockholder in its shares of our common stock. Instead, the excess portion of such
distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the non-U.S. stockholder in such shares. A non-U.S. stockholder will be subject to tax on a distribution that
exceeds both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the adjusted basis of the non-U.S. stockholder in its shares of our common stock, if
the non-U.S. stockholder otherwise would be subject to tax on gain from the sale or disposition of its shares of our common stock, as described below.
Because we generally cannot determine at the time we make a distribution whether the distribution will exceed our current and accumulated earnings
and profits, we normally will withhold tax on the entire amount of any distribution at the same rate as we would withhold on a dividend. However, a
non-U.S. stockholder may claim a refund of amounts that we withhold if we later determine that a distribution in fact exceeded our current and
accumulated earnings and profits.

Under FIRPTA (discussed below), we may be required to withhold 15% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and
profits. Consequently, although we intend to withhold at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be provided under an applicable tax treaty) on the
entire amount of any distribution, to the extent that we do not do so, we will withhold at a rate of 15% on any portion of a distribution not subject to
withholding at a rate of 30%.

For any year in which we qualify as a REIT, a non-U.S. stockholder may incur tax on distributions that are attributable to gain from our sale or
exchange of a USRPI under FIRPTA. A USRPI includes interests in real property located in the United States or the Virgin Islands and shares in
corporations at least 50% by value of whose real property interests and assets used or held for use in a trade or business consist of USRPI. Under
FIRPTA, a non-U.S. stockholder is taxed on distributions attributable to gain from sales of USRPIs as if such gain were effectively connected with a
U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. stockholder. A non-U.S. stockholder thus would be taxed on such a distribution at the normal capital gains rates
applicable to U.S. stockholders, subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of a nonresident alien
individual. A non-U.S. corporate stockholder not entitled to treaty relief or exemption also may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax on such a
distribution. Unless you are a stockholder that owns not more than 10% of our capital stock, or are a “qualified shareholder” or a “qualified foreign
pension fund” (both as defined below), we must withhold 21% of any distribution that we could designate as a capital gain dividend. A non-U.S.
stockholder may receive a credit against its tax liability for the amount we withhold.

In addition, distributions to certain non-U.S. publicly traded stockholders that meet certain record-keeping and other requirements (“qualified
shareholders”) are exempt from FIRPTA, except to the extent owners of such qualified shareholders that are not also qualified stockholders own,
actually or constructively, more than 10% of our capital stock. Furthermore, distributions to “qualified foreign pension funds” or entities all of the
interests of which are held by “qualified foreign pension funds” are exempt from FIRPTA. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding
the application of these rules.

Although not free from doubt, amounts we designate as retained capital gains in respect of the common stock held by U.S. stockholders generally
should be treated with respect to non-U.S. stockholders in the same

48


-----

manner as actual distributions by us of capital gain dividends. Under this approach, a non-U.S. stockholder would be able to offset as a credit against its
U.S. federal income tax liability resulting from its proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains, and to receive from the IRS a
refund to the extent the non-U.S. stockholder’s proportionate share of such tax paid by us exceeds its actual U.S. federal income tax liability, provided
that the non-U.S. stockholder furnishes required information to the IRS on a timely basis. We currently do not intend to retain any capital gains.

_Dispositions by Non-United States Stockholders._

A non-U.S. stockholder generally will not incur tax under FIRPTA with respect to gain on a sale of shares of common stock as long as, at all times
during a specified testing period, non-United States persons hold, directly or indirectly, less than 50% in value of our outstanding stock. We cannot
assure you that this test will be met. Even if we meet this test, pursuant to “wash sale” rules under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. stockholder may incur tax under
FIRPTA to the extent such stockholder disposes of our common stock within a certain period prior to a capital gain distribution and directly or indirectly
(including through certain affiliates) reacquires our common stock within certain prescribed periods. In addition, even if we do not meet the
“domestically controlled” test, a non-U.S. stockholder that owned, actually or constructively, 10% or less of the outstanding common stock at all times
during a specified testing period will not incur tax under FIRPTA on gain from a sale of common stock if the stock is “regularly traded” on an
established securities market. An actual or deemed disposition of our capital stock by such stockholders may also be treated as a dividend. Furthermore,
dispositions of our capital stock by “qualified foreign pension funds” or entities all of the interests of which are held by “qualified foreign pension
funds” are exempt from FIRPTA. Any gain subject to tax under FIRPTA will be treated in the same manner as it would be in the hands of U.S.
stockholders subject to alternative minimum tax, but under a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. Non-U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules.

A non-U.S. stockholder generally will incur tax on gain from the sale of common stock not subject to FIRPTA if:

    - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of the non-U.S. stockholder’s U.S. trade or business, in which case the non-U.S.

stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. stockholders with respect to the gain; or

    - the non-U.S. stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year,

in which case the non-U.S. stockholder will incur a 30% tax on capital gains.

_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act for Stockholders._

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder (which are commonly referred to as
“FATCA”), withholding is required at a rate of 30 percent on dividends in respect of our common stock held by certain foreign financial institutions
(including investment funds) and certain other non-U.S. entities, unless (i) in the case of such financial institutions, such financial institutions enter into
an agreement with the Secretary of Treasury to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities information regarding
U.S. account holders of such institutions (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institutions, as well as certain account holders that are
foreign entities with U.S. owners) and (ii) in the case of such other non-U.S. entities, such entities provide the withholding agent with a certification
either certifying that such entity does not have “substantial United States owners” or identifying any direct or indirect “substantial United States owners”
of such entity. Non-United States stockholders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implication of FATCA on their
investment in our common stock.

**SELLING STOCKHOLDERS**

Selling stockholders include certain persons or entities that, directly or indirectly, have acquired or may from time to time acquire from us, shares
of our common stock or preferred stock in various private transactions. Such selling stockholders may be parties to registration rights agreements with
us, or we otherwise may have agreed or will agree to register their securities for resale. The initial purchasers of our securities, as well as their
transferees, pledges, donees or successors, all of whom we refer to as selling stockholders, may from time to time offer and sell the common stock or
preferred stock pursuant to this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement.

The applicable prospectus supplement will set forth the name of each of the selling stockholders and the number of shares of our common stock or
preferred stock beneficially owned by such selling stockholders that are covered by such prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus supplement
will also disclose whether any of the selling stockholders has held any position or office with us, has been employed by us or otherwise has had a
material relationship with us during the three years prior to the date of the prospectus supplement.

51

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

We and/or any selling stockholders may sell the securities in any one or more of the following ways:

    - to the public through underwriting syndicates led by one or more managing underwriters;

    - directly to investors, including through a specific bidding, auction or other process;

    - to investors through agents;

    - directly to agents;

    - to or through brokers or dealers;

    - to one or more underwriters acting alone for resale to investors or to the public;

    - from time to time at prevailing market prices by the issuer or through a designated agent; or

    - through a combination of any such methods of sale.

The Company’s common stock and preferred stock may be sold domestically or abroad. Selling stockholders to be named in a prospectus
supplement may offer and sell, from time to time, common stock and preferred stock up to such amounts as set forth in a prospectus supplement. The
Company’s common stock or preferred stock may be issued upon the exchange of the debt securities of the Operating Partnership or in exchange for
other securities. We reserve the right to sell securities directly to investors on their own behalf in those jurisdictions where they are authorized to do so.

If we or any selling stockholders sell securities to a dealer acting as principal, the dealer may resell such securities at varying prices to be
determined by such dealer in its discretion at the time of resale without consulting with us or any selling stockholders and such resale prices may not be
disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement.

Any underwritten offering may be on a best efforts or a firm commitment basis. We may also offer securities through subscription rights
distributed to our stockholders on a pro rata basis, which may or may not be transferable. In any distribution of subscription rights to stockholders, if all
of the underlying securities are not subscribed for, we may then sell the unsubscribed securities directly to third parties or may engage the services of
one or more underwriters, dealers or agents, including standby underwriters, to sell the unsubscribed securities to third parties.

Sales of the securities may be effected from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions:

    - at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed;

    - at market prices prevailing at the time of sale;

    - at prices related to prevailing market prices; or

    - at negotiated prices.

Any of the prices may represent a discount from the then prevailing market prices.

In the sale of the securities, underwriters or agents may receive compensation from us in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions and
may also receive compensation from purchasers of the securities, for whom they may act as agents, in the form of discounts, concessions or
commissions. Underwriters may sell the securities to or through dealers, and such dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts,
concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agents. Discounts, concessions
and commissions may be changed from time to time. Dealers and agents that participate

52


-----

in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters under the Securities Act, and any discounts, concessions or commissions they
receive from us and any profit on the resale of securities they realize may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under applicable federal and state
securities laws.

The applicable prospectus supplement will, where applicable:

    - identify any such underwriter, dealer or agent;

    - describe any compensation in the form of discounts, concessions, commissions or otherwise received from us by each such underwriter or

agent and in the aggregate by all underwriters and agents;

    - describe any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers;

    - identify the amounts underwritten; and

    - identify the nature of the underwriter’s or underwriters’ obligation to take the securities.

Unless otherwise specified in the related prospectus supplement, each series of securities will be a new issue with no established trading market,
other than shares of the Company’s common stock, which are listed on the NYSE. Any common stock sold pursuant to a prospectus supplement will be
listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. We may elect to list any series of debt securities or preferred stock, on an exchange, but we are
not obligated to do so. It is possible that one or more underwriters may make a market in the securities, but such underwriters will not be obligated to do
so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, any
offered securities.

We and/or any selling stockholders may enter into derivative transactions with third parties, or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to
third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement, in connection with those derivative transactions
third parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus and such prospectus supplement, including in short sale transactions. If so, the third party
may use securities pledged by us and/or the selling stockholders, or borrowed from us, the selling stockholders or from others to settle those short sales
or to close out any related open borrowings of securities, and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivative transactions to close
out any related open borrowings of securities. If the third party is or may be deemed to be an underwriter under the Securities Act, it will be identified in
the applicable prospectus supplements.

Until the distribution of the securities is completed, rules of the SEC may limit the ability of any underwriters and selling group members to bid
for and purchase the securities. As an exception to these rules, underwriters are permitted to engage in some transactions that stabilize the price of the
securities. Such transactions consist of bids or purchases for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the securities.

Underwriters may engage in overallotment. If any underwriters create a short position in the securities in an offering in which they sell more
securities than are set forth on the cover page of the applicable prospectus supplement, the underwriters may reduce that short position by purchasing the
securities in the open market.

The lead underwriters may also impose a penalty bid on other underwriters and selling group members participating in an offering. This means
that if the lead underwriters purchase securities in the open market to reduce the underwriters’ short position or to stabilize the price of the securities,
they may reclaim the amount of any selling concession from the underwriters and selling group members who sold those securities as part of the
offering.

In general, purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of the security to be higher
than it might be in the absence of such purchases. The imposition of a penalty bid might also have an effect on the price of a security to the extent that it
were to discourage resales of the security before the distribution is completed.

53


-----

We do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above might have on
the price of the securities. In addition, we do not make any representation that underwriters will engage in such transactions or that such transactions,
once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

Under agreements into which we or any selling stockholders may enter, underwriters, dealers and agents who participate in the distribution of the
securities may be entitled to indemnification by us or the selling stockholders against or contribution towards certain civil liabilities, including liabilities
under the applicable securities laws.

Underwriters, dealers and agents may engage in transactions with us, perform services for us or be our tenants in the ordinary course of business.

If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will authorize underwriters or other persons acting as our agents to solicit offers by
particular institutions to purchase securities from us at the public offering price set forth in such prospectus supplement pursuant to delayed delivery
contracts providing for payment and delivery on the date or dates stated in such prospectus supplement. Each delayed delivery contract will be for an
amount no less than, and the aggregate amounts of securities sold under delayed delivery contracts shall be not less nor more than, the respective
amounts stated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Institutions with which such contracts, when authorized, may be made include commercial and
savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, educational and charitable institutions and others, but will in all cases be
subject to our approval. The obligations of any purchaser under any such contract will be subject to the conditions that (a) the purchase of the securities
shall not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any jurisdiction in the United States to which the purchaser is subject, and (b) if the
securities are being sold to underwriters, we shall have sold to the underwriters the total amount of the securities less the amount thereof covered by the
contracts. The underwriters and such other agents will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or performance of such contracts.

To comply with applicable state securities laws, the securities offered by this prospectus will be sold, if necessary, in such jurisdictions only
through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In addition, securities may not be sold in some states unless they have been registered or qualified for
sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.

Underwriters, dealers or agents that participate in the offer of securities, or their affiliates or associates, may have engaged or engage in
transactions with and perform services for, Medical Properties Trust, Inc., the Operating Partnership or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business
for which they may have received or receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses.
