1963,Offerings 2020.md,3310,MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF HOLDINGS AND THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE ISSUERS,3310.5,,3310.5.1,,"This offering memorandum includes and incorporates by reference information about Holdings, the parent company of the Operating Partnership. Holdings is not the issuer of the notes offered hereby and will not guarantee the notes. The Operating Partnership and the Co-Issuer are the issuers of the notes. Because the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the substantial majority of Holdings’ business, and is a separately identified reporting segment, we believe the financial information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, including the summary historical and pro forma financial data and pro forma financial statements, are useful to investors in evaluating an investment in the notes. However, it is important for investors to understand the material differences between the financial results and position of Holdings and the Issuers. Holdings operates in two reportable segments: its real property business, conducted through the Operating Partnership, and its golf business consisting of four golf courses, conducted through subsidiaries of Holdings that are not direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The real property business segment consists of leased real property and represents all of the Operating Partnership’s business and the substantial majority of Holdings’ business. The following table presents certain information with respect to (i) the real property business, (ii) the golf course business and (iii) the consolidated business of Holdings (consisting entirely of the real property business and the golf course business) as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

1963,Offerings 2020.md,3311,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF HOLDINGS,3311.1,,3311.1.1,,"This offering memorandum presents Funds From Operations (“FFO”), pro forma FFO, Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”), pro forma AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, each of Holdings, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). These are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Holdings believes FFO, pro forma FFO, AFFO, pro forma AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented with respect to Holdings and not the Operating Partnership or the Co-Issuer. FFO and pro forma FFO are non-GAAP financial measures that are considered supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. Consistent with the definition used by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Holdings defines FFO as net income (or loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding (i) gains (or losses) from sales of certain real estate assets, (ii) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (iii) gains and losses from change in control and (iv) impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Holdings prepares pro forma FFO by adjusting FFO to give effect to the net income associated with certain recent acquisitions and other transactions as if each such transactions had been completed on January 1, 2018 (and only to the extent not reflected in historical financial results), including: (i) the Recently Completed Transactions (as defined below), (ii) the Debt and Equity Transactions (as defined below), (iii) the JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition (as defined below) and (iv) the Eldorado Transaction, including the issuance of and use of proceeds from the Existing Senior Notes and the issuance of $2,500 million aggregate principal amount of notes in this offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts related to this offering, estimated offering expenses and the use of proceeds from the offering as described herein in “Use of Proceeds” (collectively, the “Pro Forma Transactions”). For a reconciliation of FFO and pro forma FFO to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, see “Summary— Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data of Holdings.” AFFO and pro forma AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures that Holdings uses as supplemental operating measures to evaluate its performance. Holdings calculates AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO direct financing and sales-type lease adjustments, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, other non-cash interest expense, non-real estate depreciation (which is comprised of the depreciation related to Holdings’ golf course operations), capital expenditures (which are comprised of additions to property, plant and equipment related to Holdings’ golf course operations), impairment charges and gains (or losses) on debt extinguishment.

For a reconciliation of AFFO and pro forma AFFO to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, see “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data of Holdings.” Holdings calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adding or subtracting from AFFO interest expense and interest income (collectively, interest expense, net) and income tax expense.

In addition, these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity, nor do they measure Holdings’ ability to fund all of its cash needs, including its and its subsidiaries ability to fund capital improvement or to make interest payments on indebtedness. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, pro forma FFO, AFFO, pro forma AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Holdings’ presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of Holdings’ financial results in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures in this offering memorandum are presented for Holdings, the parent company of the Operating Partnership, and not the Operating Partnership or the Co-Issuer.

- our dependence on the gaming industry; - our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies may be limited by our substantial debt service requirements and by the requirement that Holdings distribute 90% of its REIT taxable income in order to qualify for taxation as a REIT and that Holdings distribute 100% of its REIT taxable income in order to avoid current entity-level U.S. federal income taxes; - the impact of extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities; - the ability of our tenants to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals in connection with the operation of our properties;

- the possibility that we identify significant environmental, tax, legal or other issues that materially and adversely impact the value of properties acquired (or other benefits we expect to receive) in the Eldorado Transaction or any of our other pending acquisitions; - the effects of our recently completed acquisitions and the pending acquisitions including the Eldorado Transaction and the JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition on us, including the post-acquisition impact on our financial condition, financial and operating results, cash flows, strategy and plans;

Our entertainment facilities are leased to leading brands that seek to drive consumer loyalty and value with guests through superior services, experiences, products and continuous innovation. Prior to giving effect to the pending Eldorado Transaction and JACK Cleveland/ Thistledown Acquisition, each as defined and described herein, our well-maintained properties currently are located across urban, destination and drive-to markets in 13 states, contain approximately 15,500 hotel rooms and feature over 150 restaurants, bars and nightclubs across more than 40 million square feet. Our portfolio also includes approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip that is leased to Caesars, which we may look to monetize as appropriate. As a growth-focused real estate company, we expect our relationships with our partners, who lease and operate our properties, will position us for the acquisition of additional properties across the leisure and hospitality industries. Holdings’ net income, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $447.3 million, $616.9 million and $472.9 million, respectively.

On the same day, in connection with the ERI/CEC Merger, we entered into a master transaction agreement (“Master Transaction Agreement”) with ERI relating to the following transactions: - _Acquisition of MTA Properties. We have agreed to acquire the land and real estate assets associated with Harrah’s New Orleans, Harrah’s Laughlin and Harrah’s Atlantic City (collectively, the “MTA Properties”) for an aggregate purchase price of $1,823.5 million (which reflects a purchase price adjustment of $14.0 million related to Harrah’s New Orleans, which adjustment is subject to final definitive documentation) (the “MTA Properties Acquisitions”). On September 26, 2019, we entered into purchase agreements with ERI (the “MTA Purchase Agreements”) relating to the acquisition of the MTA Properties. Simultaneous with the closing of each MTA Properties Acquisition, we will enter into a triple-net lease with a subsidiary of ERI as tenant, by amending the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement to include such MTA Property with initial aggregate total annual rent payable to us and attributable to the MTA Properties of $154.0 million and an initial term of 15 years (so long as the MTA Properties Acquisitions are consummated concurrent with the closing of the ERI/CEC Merger), with the same four five-year tenant renewal options available under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement at such time. Each of our existing call options on the MTA Properties will terminate upon the earlier of the closing of the corresponding MTA Properties Acquisition or our obtaining specific performance or liquidated damages with respect to the relevant property. The purchase of each MTA Property will not be crossconditioned on the purchase of any other MTA Property (that is, we are not required to close on “all or none” of the MTA Properties). In addition, the closing of the other transactions that comprise the Eldorado Transaction is not conditioned on the completion of any or all of the MTA Properties Acquisitions. - _CPLV Incremental Rent and Lease Agreement Amendment.

We and ERI will terminate the HLV Lease Agreement and the related guaranty and, in consideration of a payment by us to ERI of $213.8 million, annual rent previously payable to us with respect to the Harrah’s Las Vegas property will be increased by $15.0 million (the “HLV Additional Rent Acquisition”). The CPLV Lease Agreement will be amended to provide, among other things, that the Harrah’s Las Vegas Property, which is currently subject to the HLV Lease Agreement, will be leased pursuant thereto (with the Harrah’s Las Vegas property subject to the higher rent escalator currently in place under the CPLV Lease Agreement). Thereafter, the as-amended CPLV Lease Agreement will be a multi-property 7 ----- master lease whereby the Harrah’s Las Vegas property tenant and the Caesars Palace Las Vegas property tenant will collectively be the tenant. - _Other Lease Modifications. We will make certain modifications to our existing lease agreements with respect to all properties at which Caesars is currently tenant, including the following (such modifications are referred to as the “Subsequent Lease Modifications”): - We will extend the initial term of all of our existing leases with Caesars such that upon the closing of the ERI/CEC Merger, each lease will have a full 15-year period prior to expiration of the initial term; - We will remove rent coverage floors, which coverage floors serve to reduce the rent escalators under such leases in the event that the “EBITDAR to Rent Ratio” (as defined in each of the leases) coverage is below the stated floor; and - We will amend the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement to, among other things: - permit the tenant to cause facilities subject to the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement that in the aggregate represent up to five percent of the aggregate EBITDAR of (A) all of the facilities under such Non-CPLV Lease Agreement and (B) the Harrah’s Joliet facility, for the 2018 fiscal year (defined as the “2018 EBITDAR Pool” in the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement, without giving effect to any increase in the 2018 EBITDAR Pool as a result of a facility being added to the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement) to be sold (whereby the tenant and landlord under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement would sell the operations and real estate, respectively, with respect to such facility); provided, among other things, that (1) we and ERI mutually agree to the split of proceeds from such sales, (2) such sales do not result in any impairment(s)/asset write down(s) by us, (3) rent under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement remains unchanged following such sale and (4) the sale does not result in us recognizing certain taxable gain; - restrict the ability of the tenant thereunder to transfer and sell the operating business of Harrah’s New Orleans and Harrah’s Atlantic City to replacement tenants without our consent and remove such restrictions with respect to Horseshoe Southern Indiana (in connection with the restrictions applying to Harrah’s New Orleans) and Horseshoe Bossier City (in connection with the restrictions applying to Harrah’s Atlantic City); provided that the tenant under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement may only sell the operating business of such properties if certain terms and conditions are met, including that replacement tenants meet certain criteria provided in the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement; and - require that the tenant under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement complete and pay for all capital improvements and other payments, costs and expenses related to the extension of the existing operating license with respect to Harrah’s New Orleans, including, without limitation, any such payments, costs and expenses required to be made to the City of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana or any other governmental body or agency. - _Centaur Properties Put/Call Agreement.

At the closing of the ERI/CEC Merger, a right of first refusal that we have with respect to the Centaur Properties will terminate and we will enter into a put/call agreement with ERI, whereby (i) we will have the right to acquire all of the land and real estate assets associated with the Centaur Properties at a price equal to 13.0x the initial annual rent of each property and to simultaneously lease back each such property to a subsidiary of ERI for initial annual rent equal to the property’s trailing four quarters EBITDA at the time of acquisition divided by 1.3 (i.e., the initial annual rent will be set at 1.3x rent coverage) and (ii) ERI will have the right to require us to acquire the Centaur Properties at a price equal to 12.5x the initial annual rent of each property, and to simultaneously lease back each such Centaur Property to a subsidiary of ERI for initial annual rent equal to the property’s trailing four quarters EBITDA at the 8 ----- time of acquisition divided by 1.3 (i.e., the initial annual rent will be set at 1.3x rent coverage). Either party will be able to trigger its respective put or call, as applicable, beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024.

If we enter into a sale leaseback transaction with ERI on any of these facilities, the leaseback will be implemented through the addition of such properties to the CPLV Lease Agreement. - _Horseshoe Baltimore ROFR.

1963,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to this offering and the notes,13.1.1,"We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and expect to incur significant additional indebtedness in connection with the closing of the Eldorado Transaction and our other pending acquisitions. Our substantial indebtedness exposes us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, limits our operating flexibility, increases the risks associated with a downturn in our business or in the businesses of our tenants, requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash to service our debt obligations, and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes and our other debt.","As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis, assuming the completion of this offering and the anticipated use of proceeds therefrom, the Eldorado Transaction and our other pending and recently completed acquisitions, offerings and other transactions as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of Holdings,” Holdings and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis would have had approximately $6.85 billion principal amount of debt outstanding, consisting of: - $2.1 billion of total indebtedness outstanding under the PropCo Term Loan B Facility; - $2.25 billion of total indebtedness outstanding under the Existing Senior Notes; and - $2.5 billion of total indebtedness outstanding under the notes offered hereby. In addition, as of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis, we would have $1.0 billion available for borrowing under our PropCo Revolving Credit Facility. Payments of principal and interest under our indebtedness, or any other indebtedness that we may incur in the future, may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pursue our business and growth strategies or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our substantial outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness, and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements, could have other significant adverse consequences, including the following: - our cash flow may be insufficient to make our required principal and interest payments on the notes or on our other indebtedness; - our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments may be increased; - we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to capitalize upon emerging acquisition opportunities, including exercising our rights of first refusal and call rights described herein, or meet operational needs; - we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of the indebtedness being refinanced; 22 ----- - we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties if permitted under the Lease Agreements, possibly on disadvantageous terms at a loss; - we may fail to comply with the payment and restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate payment of outstanding loans and foreclose on any properties securing such loans; and - we may be unable to hedge our debt, counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under our hedge agreements and these agreements may not effectively hedge interest rate fluctuation risk. If any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the foreclosure on our properties could create REIT taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, which could result in entity-level taxes to us or could adversely affect Holdings’ ability to meet the distribution requirements necessary to maintain Holdings’ qualification as a REIT. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) generally requires that a REIT distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (with certain adjustments), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at the regular corporate rate to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, including capital gains. In order to maintain Holdings’ status as a REIT and avoid or otherwise minimize current entity-level U.S. federal income taxes, a substantial portion of Holdings’ cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to its stockholders. Because of the limitations on the amount of cash available to us after satisfying our debt service obligations and our distribution requirements to maintain Holdings’ status as a REIT and avoid or otherwise minimize current entity-level U.S. federal income taxes, our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies will be limited.",N/A,as_expected,2020,158

In addition, we are required to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants under certain of our debt agreements. These restrictions and any other restrictions contained in future agreements governing our indebtedness could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our operational flexibility.

As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors in a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or our property, the holders of our or our subsidiaries’ secured debt will be entitled to be paid in full from our assets securing that secured debt before any payment may be made with respect to the notes. In addition, if we or our subsidiaries fail to meet payment or other obligations under such secured debt, the holders of that secured debt would be entitled to foreclose on our assets securing that secured debt and liquidate those assets. Accordingly, we may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, you may lose a portion of or the entire value of your investment in the notes. As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis, assuming the completion of this offering and the anticipated use of proceeds therefrom, the Eldorado Transaction and our other pending acquisitions and transactions as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of Holdings,” out of the approximately $6.85 billion principal amount of pro forma total indebtedness, $2.1 billion would have been secured indebtedness that is effectively senior to the notes, and we also would have additional availability for borrowing under our PropCo Revolving Credit Facility (subject to, among other things, compliance with the financial covenants under our PropCo Revolving Credit Facility).",N/A,as_expected,2020,158

If such a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing the notes under such agreements, we could seek the consent of our then existing lenders and other creditors to the purchase of the notes or could attempt to refinance the indebtedness that contains the prohibition. If we do not obtain such a consent or repay such indebtedness, we would remain prohibited from purchasing the notes.

We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for quotation of the notes on any automated dealer quotation system. An active trading market for the notes may not develop or, if such market develops, it could be very illiquid. We have been informed by certain of the initial purchasers that they intend to make a market in the notes after the offering is completed.

The credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall view of our industry.

Under U.S. federal bankruptcy law and similar provisions of state fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws, the issuance of the notes or the delivery of the guarantees could be avoided if a court determined that we, at the time we issued the notes: - issued the notes with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes and (1) were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence, (2) were engaged in a business or transaction for which our or such guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or (3) intended to incur, or believed that we would incur, debts beyond our or such guarantor’s ability to pay such debts as they matured. A court would likely find that we or a subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or the guarantee, as applicable, if we or such subsidiary guarantor, as applicable, did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the notes or guarantee’s issuance. If the notes or guarantees thereon were avoided or limited as a fraudulence conveyance, any claim you may make against us or the subsidiary guarantors for amounts payable on the notes or guarantees would be unenforceable to the extent of such voidance or limitation. The test for determining solvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending on the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, a court would consider an issuer or a guarantor insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the value of its property, at a fair valuation; 26 ----- - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. If a court voided our and the subsidiary guarantors’ obligations under the notes, holders of the notes would cease to be our creditors and likely have no source from which to recover amounts due under the notes.

The PropCo Credit Facilities initially bore interest at the London Interbank Overnight Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 2.25%. Upon Holdings’ initial public offering, on February 5, 2018, the interest rate was reduced to LIBOR plus 2.00%, as contemplated by the PropCo Credit Agreement. As a result of our repayment of $100.0 million principal amount of the PropCo Term Loan B Facility in February 2018, $2.1 billion of total indebtedness is currently outstanding under the PropCo Term Loan B Facility. On May 15, 2019, VICI PropCo entered into Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment No. 2”) to the PropCo Credit Agreement, pursuant to which certain lenders agreed to provide VICI PropCo with incremental revolving credit commitments and availability under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million on the same terms as VICI PropCo’s current revolving credit facility under the Revolving Credit Facility. After giving effect to Amendment No. 2, the PropCo Credit Agreement provided total borrowing capacity pursuant to the revolving credit commitments in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. On May 15, 2019, immediately after giving effect to Amendment No. 2, VICI PropCo entered into Amendment No. 3 (“Amendment No. 3”) to the PropCo Credit Agreement, which amended and restated the PropCo Credit Agreement in its entirety as of May 15, 2019 (the “Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) refinance the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility in whole with a new class of revolving commitments, (ii) extend the maturity date of the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility from December 22, 2022 to May 15, 2024, (iii) provide that borrowings under the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility will accrue based on a leverage-based pricing grid with a range of between 1.75% to 2.00% over LIBOR, or between 0.75% and 1.00% over the base rate, in each case depending on the total net debt to adjusted total assets ratio of VICI PropCo and its restricted subsidiaries (the “VICI PropCo Group”), (iv) provide that the commitment fee payable under the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate based on a leverage-based pricing grid with a range of between 0.375% to 0.50% depending on VICI PropCo Group’s total net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, (v) amend the existing springing financial covenant, which previously required VICI PropCo to maintain a total net debt to adjusted asset ratio of not more than 0.75 to 1.00 (or, during any fiscal quarter in which certain permitted acquisitions were consummated and the three consecutive fiscal quarters thereafter, not more than 0.80 to 1.00) if utilization of the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 30%, to require that, only with respect to the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ending after the effectiveness of Amendment No. 3, VICI PropCo maintain a maximum total net debt to adjusted asset ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter (or, during any fiscal quarter in which certain permitted acquisitions were consummated and the three consecutive fiscal quarters thereafter, not more than 0.70 to 1.00) regardless of the level of utilization of the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility, and (vi) include a new financial covenant, only with respect to the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility, requiring VICI PropCo to maintain, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter after the effectiveness of Amendment No. 3, an interest coverage ratio (defined as EBITDA to interest charges) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. The PropCo Revolving Credit Facility is available to be used for working capital purposes, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, permitted investments, permitted restricted payments and for other lawful corporate purposes.

VICI PropCo intends to enter into an amendment to the Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement, which, among other things, is expected to reduce the interest rate spread on the PropCo Term Loan B Facility, which is currently LIBOR plus 2.00%, by up to 0.25%. 46 ----- The Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement provides that, in the event LIBOR is no longer in effect, a comparable or successor rate approved by the Administrative Agent thereunder shall be utilized, provided that such approved rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice.

There can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient funds available at the time of any Change of Control to make any debt payment (including repurchases of notes) required by the foregoing covenant (as well as any covenant that may be contained in other securities of the Company or that might be outstanding at the time). Subject to the following paragraph, the provisions described above that require the Company to make an Offer to Purchase following a Change of Control will be applicable regardless of whether any other provisions of the indentures are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indentures shall not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, holders of notes may not be entitled to require the Company to purchase their notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of the Company’s Board of Directors. 76 ----- The Company will not be required to make an Offer to Purchase upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Offer to Purchase in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indentures applicable to an Offer to Purchase made by the Company and purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Offer to Purchase. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer to Purchase and the Company, or any third party making an Offer to Purchase in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Company will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer to Purchase described above, to redeem all notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but not including, such purchase date. The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes as a result of Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described hereunder, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the covenant described hereunder by virtue of our compliance with such securities laws or regulations. If the terms of any Credit Facilities prohibit the Company from making an Offer to Purchase or from purchasing the notes pursuant thereto, prior to the sending of the notice to holders, but in any event within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company covenants to: (1) repay in full all Indebtedness outstanding under such Credit Facilities or offer to repay in full all such Indebtedness and repay the Indebtedness of each lender who has accepted such offer; or (2) obtain the requisite consent under such Credit Facilities to permit the purchase of the notes as described above. The Company must first comply with the covenants described in clauses (1) and (2) above before it will be required to purchase notes in the event of a Change of Control; provided, however, that the Company’s failure to comply with the covenant described in the preceding sentence or to make an Offer to Purchase because of any such failure shall constitute a Default described in clause (4) under “ —Events of Default” below (and not under clause (3) thereof); provided further, if the Company has instituted any liability management procedures or is otherwise engaged in obtaining the requisite consents under such Credit Facilities to permit the purchase of the notes (such engagement to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion), the Company shall have an additional 30 days following the initial 30-day period after the occurrence of a Change of Control to secure such consents and no Default shall have occurred if such consents are obtained within such 30-day period. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a holder of notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the notes as described above. The provisions under the indentures governing the notes relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes. 77 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,158

(7) any final judgment or order (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $200 million for all such final judgments or orders against the Company, the Co-Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary; (A) is rendered against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary and is not paid or discharged; and 79 ----- (B) there shall be any period of 60 consecutive days following entry of the final judgment or order that causes the aggregate amount for all such final judgments or orders outstanding and not paid or discharged against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to exceed $200 million during which a stay of enforcement of such final judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect;

As to the waiver of defaults, see “—Modification and waiver.” The holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the applicable trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on such trustee. However, such trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the applicable indenture, that may involve such trustee in personal liability, or that such trustee determines in good faith may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of notes not joining in the giving of such direction and may take any other action it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from holders of notes. A holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to the applicable indenture or the applicable series of notes unless: (1) the holder gives the applicable trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default; (2) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding notes make a written request to the applicable trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holder or holders offer the applicable trustee indemnity and security satisfactory to such trustee against any costs, liability or expense; (4) the applicable trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the provision of indemnity and security; and (5) during such 60-day period, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding notes do not give the applicable trustee a direction that is inconsistent with the request. However, such limitations do not apply to the right of any holder of a note to receive payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, such note or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the due date expressed in the notes, which right shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the holder.

The Issuers will issue the % senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) under an indenture (the “2025 Indenture”) among the Issuers, the Subsidiary Guarantors and UMB Bank n.a., as trustee (the “2025 Trustee”), the % senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) under an indenture (the “2027 Indenture”) among the Issuers, the Subsidiary Guarantors and UMB Bank n.a., as trustee (the “2027 Trustee”), and the % senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes” and, collectively with the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes, the “notes”) under an indenture (the “2030 Indenture” and, together with the 2025 Indenture and the 2027 Indenture, the “indentures”) among the Issuers, the Subsidiary Guarantors and UMB Bank n.a., as trustee (the “2030 Trustee” and, together with the 2025 Trustee and 2027 Trustee, the “trustees”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” The indentures will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”), or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of the notes include only those stated in the applicable indenture. The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indentures. It does not restate the indentures in their entirety. We urge you to read the indentures because they, and not this description, define your rights as a holder of the notes. Copies of the indentures are available as set forth below under “—Additional information.” Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain definitions” have the meanings assigned to them in the applicable indenture.

1963,Offerings 2020.md,205,"BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM",205.1,Global notes,205.1.1,,"We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the global notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial interests represented by such global notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchaser and ownership of beneficial interests in the global notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the global notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the indentures. No beneficial owner of an interest in the global notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the applicable indenture with respect to the notes. 122 ----- Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on, the global notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. Neither we, the trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on the global notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the global notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers, registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security (as defined below) for any reason, including to sell notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of the notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in a global note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the applicable indenture. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the global notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the applicable indenture, DTC will exchange the applicable global notes for Certificated Securities (as defined below), which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading “Notice to Investors.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations 123 ----- that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. The information above concerning DTC has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for its accuracy. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers or interests in the global notes among participants of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,158

Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the distribution compliance period, only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream. 124 ----- Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Restricted Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the global notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other global note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such global note and will become an interest in the other global note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other global note for so long as it remains such an interest. 125 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,158

We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies are remote or incidental, and we do not intend to treat the notes as contingent payment debt instruments. Our position that such contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder unless such holder discloses to the IRS its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our position is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, a holder might be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate (as described below) on the notes, and to treat as ordinary interest income any gain realized on the taxable disposition of a note.

Upon the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the_ notes, you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash or other property received (other than any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as such to the extent not already included in income) and your adjusted tax basis in the notes (your adjusted tax basis in your notes generally will be your purchase price for the notes). Any gain or loss you realize upon such a sale or disposition of a note generally will be capital gain or loss. This gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period for the notes is greater than one year. Under current law, long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders are generally taxed at lower rates than items of ordinary income.

Under current Treasury regulations. you can meet the foregoing certification requirement if: - you (or your agent) deliver to the withholding agent an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form), signed by you or your agent on your behalf, certifying your non-U.S. status; - you hold your notes through a securities clearing organization or certain other financial institutions, and the organization or institution that holds your notes provides a signed statement to the withholding agent that is accompanied by an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) provided by you to that same organization or institution; or - you hold your notes directly through a “qualified intermediary” (generally a non-U.S. financial institution or clearing organization or a non-U.S. branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or clearing organization that is a party to a withholding agreement with the IRS) and certain conditions are satisfied. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the application of the U.S. withholding tax rules to your particular circumstances. In the event that you do not meet the foregoing requirements, interest on the notes will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at 30% unless reduced by an applicable income tax treaty. Interest on your notes that is effectively connected with your U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, you maintain a permanent establishment in the United States to which such interest is attributable) will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax if you have certified to the withholding agent (generally, we, or a financial institution acting as our agent, will be the withholding agent) on IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) that you are exempt from such withholding tax. Such interest will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis generally in the same manner as if you were a U.S. holder, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. If a non-U.S. holder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty between the United States and its country of residence, any interest that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the manner specified by the treaty and generally will only be subject to such tax if such income is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, that are effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business. 128 ----- The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty. _Sale or redemption of the notes. Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, if you sell_ or otherwise dispose of your notes in a transaction that is treated as a taxable sale or exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including a retirement or redemption), you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain you recognize on this transaction, unless: - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, you maintain a permanent establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable); or - you are an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the year in which you disposed of your notes and certain other conditions are met. A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the net gain derived from the sale generally in the same manner as a non-U.S. holder with respect to the effectively connected interest described above. The gain may qualify for a lower applicable treaty rate. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, that are effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. An individual non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will be subject to a flat 30% U.S. federal income tax on the gain derived from the sale, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses, even though the holder is not considered a resident of the United States (provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses). A non-U.S. holder’s ability to claim a loss on the disposition of the notes will be subject to substantial limitations.

In particular, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of ownership of notes by investors that do not hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: - dealers in securities; - traders that elect to mark their securities to market; - tax-exempt investors; - partnerships, S corporations, or other entities taxed as a pass-through or investors therein; - U.S. expatriates or former long-term permanent residents; - regulated investment companies, REITs, banks, thrifts, insurance companies or other financial institutions or financial service entities; - persons that hold the notes as a position in a straddle or as part of a synthetic security or hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction or other integrated investment; - persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an “applicable financial statement”; - U.S. holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; or - retirement plans.

The term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that is an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not a U.S. holder. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally depends on the status and tax situs of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

In addition, the notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.” We do not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for the notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue any market making in the notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading 134 ----- market will develop for the notes, that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes or cause the price of the notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for its own account and for the accounts of its customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that it acquires, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge or otherwise reduce their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, commercial lending and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are holders of the PropCo Notes. As described under “Use of Proceeds”, we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to redeem the PropCo Notes. As a result, such initial purchasers or their affiliates will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering upon redemption of the PropCo Notes. Affiliates of the initial purchasers are lenders and/or agents under the PropCo Credit Agreement. Affiliates of the initial purchasers are also commitment parties to the Bridge Facilities. Following the issuance of the notes, we expect to reduce the commitments under the Bridge Facilities by $2.0 billion. Delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about, 2020, which will be the tenth business day following the date hereof (such settlement being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by the virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+10, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors. 135 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,158
