**MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF**
**HOLDINGS AND THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE ISSUERS**

This offering memorandum includes and incorporates by reference information about Holdings, the parent
company of the Operating Partnership. Holdings is not the issuer of the notes offered hereby and will not
guarantee the notes. The Operating Partnership and the Co-Issuer are the issuers of the notes. Because the
Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries represent the substantial majority of Holdings’ business,
and is a separately identified reporting segment, we believe the financial information included or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum, including the summary historical and pro forma financial data and pro
forma financial statements, are useful to investors in evaluating an investment in the notes. However, it is
important for investors to understand the material differences between the financial results and position of
Holdings and the Issuers.

Holdings operates in two reportable segments: its real property business, conducted through the Operating
Partnership, and its golf business consisting of four golf courses, conducted through subsidiaries of Holdings that
are not direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The real property business segment consists of
leased real property and represents all of the Operating Partnership’s business and the substantial majority of
Holdings’ business. The following table presents certain information with respect to (i) the real property
business, (ii) the golf course business and (iii) the consolidated business of Holdings (consisting entirely of the
real property business and the golf course business) as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2019 and September 30, 2018 and as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Co-Issuer does not have
any assets, liabilities or operations (other than as co-issuer of the Existing Senior Notes).

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF HOLDINGS**

This offering memorandum presents Funds From Operations (“FFO”), pro forma FFO, Adjusted Funds
From Operations (“AFFO”), pro forma AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, each of
Holdings, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States (“GAAP”). These are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be construed as
alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Holdings believes FFO, pro forma FFO, AFFO, pro forma AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our business. These
non-GAAP financial measures are presented with respect to Holdings and not the Operating Partnership or the
Co-Issuer.

FFO and pro forma FFO are non-GAAP financial measures that are considered supplemental measures for
the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. Consistent with the definition used by The National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Holdings defines FFO as net income (or loss) (computed in
accordance with GAAP) excluding (i) gains (or losses) from sales of certain real estate assets, (ii) depreciation
and amortization related to real estate, (iii) gains and losses from change in control and (iv) impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to
decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Holdings prepares pro forma FFO by adjusting
FFO to give effect to the net income associated with certain recent acquisitions and other transactions as if each
such transactions had been completed on January 1, 2018 (and only to the extent not reflected in historical
financial results), including: (i) the Recently Completed Transactions (as defined below), (ii) the Debt and Equity
Transactions (as defined below), (iii) the JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition (as defined below) and
(iv) the Eldorado Transaction, including the issuance of and use of proceeds from the Existing Senior Notes and
the issuance of $2,500 million aggregate principal amount of notes in this offering, after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discounts related to this offering, estimated offering expenses and the use of proceeds from the
offering as described herein in “Use of Proceeds” (collectively, the “Pro Forma Transactions”). For a
reconciliation of FFO and pro forma FFO to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, see “Summary—
Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data of Holdings.”

AFFO and pro forma AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures that Holdings uses as supplemental
operating measures to evaluate its performance. Holdings calculates AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO
direct financing and sales-type lease adjustments, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of
real estate investments, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt issuance costs and
original issue discount, other non-cash interest expense, non-real estate depreciation (which is comprised of the
depreciation related to Holdings’ golf course operations), capital expenditures (which are comprised of additions
to property, plant and equipment related to Holdings’ golf course operations), impairment charges and gains (or
losses) on debt extinguishment. Holdings prepares pro forma AFFO by adjusting AFFO to give effect to the net
income associated with the Pro Forma Transactions as if the Pro Forma Transactions had occurred on January 1,
2018 (and only to the extent not reflected in historical financial results). For a reconciliation of AFFO and pro
forma AFFO to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, see “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro
Forma Financial Data of Holdings.”

Holdings calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adding or subtracting from AFFO interest expense and interest
income (collectively, interest expense, net) and income tax expense. Holdings prepares pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA by adjusting Adjusted EBITDA to give effect to the net income associated with the Pro Forma
Transactions as if the Pro Forma Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2018 (and only to the extent not
reflected in historical financial results). For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, see “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro
Forma Financial Data of Holdings.”

-----

These non-GAAP financial measures: (i) do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP;
(ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash
flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of
liquidity. In addition, these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity, nor do they measure
Holdings’ ability to fund all of its cash needs, including its and its subsidiaries ability to fund capital
improvement or to make interest payments on indebtedness. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, pro forma
FFO, AFFO, pro forma AFFO, Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies, including real estate investment
trusts (“REITs”), due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Holdings’
presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of Holdings’ financial results in accordance with
GAAP.

The non-GAAP financial measures in this offering memorandum are presented for Holdings, the parent
company of the Operating Partnership, and not the Operating Partnership or the Co-Issuer. For a description of
the material differences between the consolidated financial statements of Holdings and the financial information
of the Operating Partnership and the Co-Issuer, see “Material Differences between the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Holdings and the Financial Information of the Issuers.”

**Overview of Our Company**

We are an owner and acquirer of experiential real estate assets across leading gaming, hospitality,
entertainment and leisure destinations. Our national, geographically diverse portfolio currently consists of 27
gaming facilities, including Caesars Palace Las Vegas and Harrah’s Las Vegas, which we believe are two of the
most iconic entertainment facilities on the Las Vegas Strip. Our entertainment facilities are leased to leading
brands that seek to drive consumer loyalty and value with guests through superior services, experiences, products
and continuous innovation. Prior to giving effect to the pending Eldorado Transaction and JACK Cleveland/
Thistledown Acquisition, each as defined and described herein, our well-maintained properties currently are
located across urban, destination and drive-to markets in 13 states, contain approximately 15,500 hotel rooms and
feature over 150 restaurants, bars and nightclubs across more than 40 million square feet.

Our portfolio also includes approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land adjacent to the
Las Vegas Strip that is leased to Caesars, which we may look to monetize as appropriate. As a growth-focused
real estate company, we expect our relationships with our partners, who lease and operate our properties, will
position us for the acquisition of additional properties across the leisure and hospitality industries.

Holdings’ net income, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 were
$447.3 million, $616.9 million and $472.9 million, respectively. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO
reconciliations to Holdings’ net income, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures of Holdings” and “—Summary
Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data of Holdings.”

Financial statements of the Operating Partnership are not presented in or incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum, and you should review “Material Differences between the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Holdings and the Financial Information of the Issuers” for important information about the
financial information of the Operating Partnership and the Co-Issuer.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe the following strengths effectively position us to execute our business and growth strategies:

**_Leading portfolio of high-quality experiential gaming, hospitality, entertainment and leisure assets._**

Our portfolio features Caesars Palace Las Vegas and Harrah’s Las Vegas and market-leading urban,
destination and regional properties with significant scale. Our properties are well-maintained and leased to
leading brands, such as Caesars, Horseshoe, Harrah’s, Hard Rock, Bally’s and Margaritaville. These brands seek
to drive loyalty and value with guests through superior service and products and continuous innovation. Our
portfolio benefits from its strong mix of demand generators, including casinos, guest rooms, restaurants,
entertainment facilities, bars and nightclubs and convention space. We believe our properties are well-insulated
from incremental competition as a result of high replacement costs, as well as regulatory restrictions and longlead times for new development. We believe that the high quality of our properties appeals to a broad base of
customers, stimulating traffic and visitation.

Our portfolio is anchored by our Las Vegas properties, Caesars Palace Las Vegas and Harrah’s Las Vegas,
which are located at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. We believe Las Vegas is a market characterized by steady
economic growth and high consumer and business demand with limited new supply. Our Las Vegas properties,
which we believe are two of the most iconic entertainment facilities in Las Vegas, feature gaming entertainment,
large-scale hotels, extensive food and beverage options, state-of-the-art convention facilities, retail outlets and
entertainment showrooms.

Our portfolio also includes market-leading regional resorts and destinations that we believe are benefiting
from significant invested capital over recent years. The regional properties we own include award-winning landbased and dockside casinos, hotels and entertainment facilities that operate primarily under the Caesars,
Harrah’s, Horseshoe, Hard Rock, Bally’s and Margaritaville trademark and brand names, which, in many
instances, have market-leading brand recognition.

Under the terms of the Lease Agreements, the tenants are required to continue to invest in the properties,
which we believe will enhance the value of our properties.

**_Our properties feature diversified sources of revenue on both a business and geographic basis._**

Our portfolio includes 27 geographically diverse casino resorts that serve numerous Metropolitan Statistical
Areas nationally. This diversity reduces our exposure to adverse events that may affect any single geographic
market. In addition, our tenants benefit from multiple revenue streams derived from an economically diverse set
of customers and services to such customers. These include gaming, food and beverage, entertainment,
hospitality and other sources of revenue. We believe that this geographic diversity and the diversity of revenue
sources that our tenants derive from our leased properties improves the stability of rental revenue.

**_Our long-term Lease Agreements, which include contractual annual rent escalators, provide a highly_**
**_predictable base level of rent to service our debt._**

Our properties are 100% leased pursuant to our long-term triple-net Lease Agreements with subsidiaries of
Caesars, Penn National, Hard Rock and Century Casinos. Further, our leases provide embedded growth through
contractual annual rent escalators and 15-year initial terms with four five-year renewal options.

All of our casino resort properties are established assets with extensive operating histories. Based on
historical performance of the properties, we expect that the properties will generate sufficient revenues for
Caesars’, Penn National’s, Hard Rock’s and Century Casinos’ respective subsidiaries to pay to us all rent due
under the Lease Agreements. This revenue stream provides us with highly stable cash flow to service our debt.

**_Caesars or Caesars Resort Collection, LLC (“CRC”) guarantees the payment obligations of our tenants_**
**_under the Caesars Lease Agreements, Penn National guarantees the payment obligations of our tenants under_**
**_the Margaritaville and Greektown Lease Agreement, Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment guarantees the_**
**_payment obligations of our tenant under the JACK Cincinnati Lease Agreement and Century Casinos_**
**_guarantees the payment obligations of our tenants under the Century Lease Agreement._**

All of our existing properties are leased to subsidiaries of Caesars, Penn National, Hard Rock or Century
Casinos. Caesars guarantees the payment obligations of our tenants under the CPLV Lease Agreement, the Joliet
Lease Agreement and the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement, CRC, a subsidiary of Caesars, guarantees the payment
obligations of our tenant under the HLV Lease Agreement, Penn National guarantees the payment obligations of our
tenants under the Margaritaville Lease Agreement and the Greektown Lease Agreement, Seminole Hard Rock
Entertainment, Inc. guarantees the payment obligations of our tenant under the JACK Cincinnati Lease Agreement
and Century Casinos guarantees the payment obligations of our tenants under the Century Lease Agreement.

In addition to the properties leased from us, Caesars, Penn National, Hard Rock and Century Casinos
operate numerous other casino resorts, collectively comprising a nationally recognized portfolio of brands.
Caesars’ brands include Caesars, Harrah’s, Horseshoe and Bally’s, and Caesars operates its portfolio of
properties (including the properties that are leased from us) using the Caesars Rewards[®] customer loyalty
program. Core to Caesars’ cross market strategy, the Caesars Rewards[®] program is designed to encourage
Caesars’ customers to direct a larger share of their entertainment spending to Caesars. Penn National’s brands
include, but are not limited to, Hollywood, Boomtown, Argosy and Margaritaville, and Penn National operates
its portfolio of properties (including the property leased from us) using the mychoice[®] customer loyalty program.
Hard Rock operates its portfolio of hotel, casino and cafe properties under its Hard Rock brands with destinations
including Hard Rock’s two most successful hotel and casino properties in Tampa and Hollywood, Florida.
Century Casinos is an international casino entertainment company that operates worldwide. Although these other
properties are not our direct tenants, they help to support the corporate-level parent guarantee from Caesars, Penn
National, Hard Rock and Century Casinos and lift coverage multiples.

**_Holdings has a proven track record of prudent capital allocation and is committed to a conservatively_**
**_managed balance sheet._**

Holdings has a demonstrable acquisition track record having closed acquisitions of approximately $290 million
of annual rent for approximately $3.5 billion from the Formation Date through December 31, 2019. In addition,
Holdings will acquire over $318 million of additional annual rent for approximately $4.1 billion in connection with
the pending JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition and Eldorado Transaction, including the pending acquisition
of the MTA Properties, the CPLV Additional Rent Acquisition (as defined below) and HLV Additional Rent
Acquisition (as defined below). Holdings believes its disciplined M&A approach focused on market quality, asset
real estate quality, asset income quality and long-term AFFO growth and accretion positions it well as it evaluates
future growth opportunities in the broader experiential space. Since the Formation Date, Holdings has reduced its
net leverage to 4.2x for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Additionally, recent large acquisitions have
helped Holdings to diversify its tenant concentration, including through adding affiliates of Penn National, Hard
Rock and Century Casinos as tenants since the Formation Date. Furthermore, following the closing of the pending
JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition, affiliates of JACK Entertainment will become tenants. Throughout these
acquisitions, Holdings has remained focused on achieving target net leverage of 5.0 – 5.5x.

**_Actionable growth opportunities across identified pipeline of right of first refusal and put/call properties_**
**_in addition to other experiential real estate assets._**

The pending Eldorado Transaction refuels our embedded growth pipeline and further demonstrates our ability
to grow our portfolio and positions us for future growth. As part of the pending Eldorado Transaction, we will
acquire the land and real estate assets associated with Harrah’s New Orleans, Harrah’s Laughlin and Harrah’s
Atlantic City and will enter into put/call agreements on Harrah’s Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand, rights of first
refusal on two Las Vegas Strip assets, as well as a right of first refusal on Horseshoe Baltimore (subject to any
consent required from Caesars’ joint venture partners with respect to the Baltimore asset).

**_Independent and experienced board of directors._**

Holdings’ independent board of directors, which is comprised of highly skilled and seasoned real estate,
gaming, hospitality, consumer products and corporate professionals, was established to ensure that none of its
directors are executive officers of our tenants. In addition, Holdings’ board of directors is not staggered, with
each of its directors subject to re-election annually.

**Our Properties**

The following chart and table summarize Holdings’ current portfolio of properties as of December 31, 2019
(including the four golf courses owned by Holdings, in which the Operating Partnership does not have an
interest), as well as Holdings’ pending acquisition properties, property subject to the put/call option agreement
with Caesars and properties subject to the right of first refusal agreements and put/call agreement pending
completion of the Eldorado Transaction. Holdings’ properties are diversified across a range of primary uses,
including gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail, and other resort amenities and activities. The
portfolio presented below includes Holdings’ golf course properties. The Operating Partnership does not receive
revenue from and does not have any investment in Holdings’ golf operations, and the entities that comprise
Holdings’ golf operations do not guarantee the notes. For more information, see “Material Differences between
the Consolidated Financial Statements of Holdings and the Financial Information of the Issuers.”

**HIGH QUALITY DIVERSIFIED REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO ANCHORED BY ICONIC ASSETS**

**Note: Transactions pending completion are subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The Eldorado Transaction and the pending disposition are also**
**subject to the consummation of the ERI/CEC Merger. We can provide no assurances that the pending transactions and/or the ERI/CEC Merger will be consummated on the**
**terms or time frames contemplated, or at all.**

1. On January 15, 2020, the Company announced that it and Caesars had entered into definitive documentation to jointly sell the Harrah’s Reno Hotel and Casino, which disposition
will be in compliance with the requirements of the Company’s existing debt documents. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive documentation relating to this disposition, the rent
pursuant to the Non-CPLV Master Lease will remain unchanged following closing of the transaction.

2. The put/call option on Harrah’s Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand Racing & Casino (13.0x call/12.5x put) can be exercised between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2024. The
put option on the Caesars Forum Convention Center can be exercised between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024 at 13.0x. The call option on the Caesars Forum Convention

right of first refusal on Horseshoe Baltimore upon the closing of the ERI/CEC Merger. The combined ERI/CEC entity
will not have a contractual obligation to sell the properties, nor will the Company have an obligation to buy such

**Our Recent Transactions**

_Eldorado Transaction_

On June 24, 2019, ERI entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CEC for a combination of ERI stock
and cash. On the same day, in connection with the ERI/CEC Merger, we entered into a master transaction
agreement (“Master Transaction Agreement”) with ERI relating to the following transactions:

    - _Acquisition of MTA Properties. We have agreed to acquire the land and real estate assets associated_
with Harrah’s New Orleans, Harrah’s Laughlin and Harrah’s Atlantic City (collectively, the “MTA
Properties”) for an aggregate purchase price of $1,823.5 million (which reflects a purchase price
adjustment of $14.0 million related to Harrah’s New Orleans, which adjustment is subject to final
definitive documentation) (the “MTA Properties Acquisitions”). On September 26, 2019, we entered
into purchase agreements with ERI (the “MTA Purchase Agreements”) relating to the acquisition of the
MTA Properties. Simultaneous with the closing of each MTA Properties Acquisition, we will enter into
a triple-net lease with a subsidiary of ERI as tenant, by amending the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement to
include such MTA Property with initial aggregate total annual rent payable to us and attributable to the
MTA Properties of $154.0 million and an initial term of 15 years (so long as the MTA Properties
Acquisitions are consummated concurrent with the closing of the ERI/CEC Merger), with the same
four five-year tenant renewal options available under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement at such time.
Each of our existing call options on the MTA Properties will terminate upon the earlier of the closing
of the corresponding MTA Properties Acquisition or our obtaining specific performance or liquidated
damages with respect to the relevant property. The purchase of each MTA Property will not be crossconditioned on the purchase of any other MTA Property (that is, we are not required to close on “all or
none” of the MTA Properties). In addition, the closing of the other transactions that comprise the
Eldorado Transaction is not conditioned on the completion of any or all of the MTA Properties
Acquisitions.

    - _CPLV Incremental Rent and Lease Agreement Amendment. In consideration of a payment by us to ERI of_
$1,189.9 million, we will be entitled to $83.5 million of incremental annual rent under the CPLV Lease
Agreement (the “CPLV Additional Rent Acquisition”) and the other lease modifications described below.

    - _HLV Lease Termination, HLV Incremental Rent and Creation of Las Vegas Master Lease. We and ERI_
will terminate the HLV Lease Agreement and the related guaranty and, in consideration of a payment
by us to ERI of $213.8 million, annual rent previously payable to us with respect to the Harrah’s Las
Vegas property will be increased by $15.0 million (the “HLV Additional Rent Acquisition”). The
CPLV Lease Agreement will be amended to provide, among other things, that the Harrah’s Las Vegas
Property, which is currently subject to the HLV Lease Agreement, will be leased pursuant thereto (with
the Harrah’s Las Vegas property subject to the higher rent escalator currently in place under the CPLV
Lease Agreement). Thereafter, the as-amended CPLV Lease Agreement will be a multi-property


7


-----

master lease whereby the Harrah’s Las Vegas property tenant and the Caesars Palace Las Vegas
property tenant will collectively be the tenant.

- _Other Lease Modifications. We will make certain modifications to our existing lease agreements with_
respect to all properties at which Caesars is currently tenant, including the following (such
modifications are referred to as the “Subsequent Lease Modifications”):

   - We will extend the initial term of all of our existing leases with Caesars such that upon the closing
of the ERI/CEC Merger, each lease will have a full 15-year period prior to expiration of the initial
term;

   - We will remove rent coverage floors, which coverage floors serve to reduce the rent escalators
under such leases in the event that the “EBITDAR to Rent Ratio” (as defined in each of the leases)
coverage is below the stated floor; and

   - We will amend the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement to, among other things:

      - permit the tenant to cause facilities subject to the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement that in the
aggregate represent up to five percent of the aggregate EBITDAR of (A) all of the facilities
under such Non-CPLV Lease Agreement and (B) the Harrah’s Joliet facility, for the 2018
fiscal year (defined as the “2018 EBITDAR Pool” in the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement,
without giving effect to any increase in the 2018 EBITDAR Pool as a result of a facility
being added to the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement) to be sold (whereby the tenant and landlord
under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement would sell the operations and real estate,
respectively, with respect to such facility); provided, among other things, that (1) we and ERI
mutually agree to the split of proceeds from such sales, (2) such sales do not result in any
impairment(s)/asset write down(s) by us, (3) rent under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement
remains unchanged following such sale and (4) the sale does not result in us recognizing
certain taxable gain;

      - restrict the ability of the tenant thereunder to transfer and sell the operating business of
Harrah’s New Orleans and Harrah’s Atlantic City to replacement tenants without our consent
and remove such restrictions with respect to Horseshoe Southern Indiana (in connection with
the restrictions applying to Harrah’s New Orleans) and Horseshoe Bossier City (in
connection with the restrictions applying to Harrah’s Atlantic City); provided that the tenant
under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement may only sell the operating business of such
properties if certain terms and conditions are met, including that replacement tenants meet
certain criteria provided in the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement; and

      - require that the tenant under the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement complete and pay for all
capital improvements and other payments, costs and expenses related to the extension of the
existing operating license with respect to Harrah’s New Orleans, including, without
limitation, any such payments, costs and expenses required to be made to the City of New
Orleans, the State of Louisiana or any other governmental body or agency.

- _Centaur Properties Put/Call Agreement. Affiliates of Caesars currently own two gaming facilities in_
Indiana—Harrah’s Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand (together, the “Centaur Properties”). At the closing
of the ERI/CEC Merger, a right of first refusal that we have with respect to the Centaur Properties will
terminate and we will enter into a put/call agreement with ERI, whereby (i) we will have the right to
acquire all of the land and real estate assets associated with the Centaur Properties at a price equal to
13.0x the initial annual rent of each property and to simultaneously lease back each such property to a
subsidiary of ERI for initial annual rent equal to the property’s trailing four quarters EBITDA at the
time of acquisition divided by 1.3 (i.e., the initial annual rent will be set at 1.3x rent coverage) and
(ii) ERI will have the right to require us to acquire the Centaur Properties at a price equal to 12.5x the
initial annual rent of each property, and to simultaneously lease back each such Centaur Property to a
subsidiary of ERI for initial annual rent equal to the property’s trailing four quarters EBITDA at the


8


-----

time of acquisition divided by 1.3 (i.e., the initial annual rent will be set at 1.3x rent coverage). Either
party will be able to trigger its respective put or call, as applicable, beginning on January 1, 2022 and
ending on December 31, 2024. The put/call agreement will provide that the leaseback of the Centaur
Properties will be implemented through addition of the Centaur Properties to the Non-CPLV Lease
Agreement.

    - _Las Vegas Strip Assets ROFR. We will enter into a right of first refusal agreement with ERI pursuant to_
which we will have the first right, with respect to the first two of certain specified Las Vegas Strip
assets that ERI proposes to sell to a third party, to acquire any such asset. Pursuant to the Master
Transaction Agreement, the specified Las Vegas Strip assets are (with respect to the first asset subject
to the right of first refusal) the land and real estate associated with the Flamingo Las Vegas, Paris Las
Vegas, Planet Hollywood and Bally’s Las Vegas gaming facilities and (with respect to the second asset
subject to the right of first refusal) the foregoing gaming facilities plus The LINQ Hotel & Casino. If
we enter into a sale leaseback transaction with ERI on any of these facilities, the leaseback will be
implemented through the addition of such properties to the CPLV Lease Agreement.

    - _Horseshoe Baltimore ROFR. We and ERI have agreed to enter into a right of first refusal agreement_
pursuant to which we will have a first right to enter into a sale leaseback transaction with respect to the
land and real estate assets associated with the Horseshoe Baltimore gaming facility (subject to any
consent required from Caesars’ joint venture partners with respect to this asset).

    - _ERI Guaranties. ERI will execute new guaranties of the CPLV Lease Agreement (which will be our_
single master Las Vegas lease incorporating both the Caesars Palace and Harrah’s Las Vegas
properties, as described above), the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement and the Joliet Lease Agreement, and
the existing guaranties of Caesars of such leases will be terminated with respect to Caesars.

    - _CPLV CMBS Refinancing. A portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the Existing Senior Notes_
were used to repay the CPLV CMBS Debt in full. See “—Other Recent Transactions” for more
information regarding the repayment of the CPLV CMBS Debt.

The transactions described above, other than the refinancing of the CPLV CMBS Debt (which was
completed in November 2019), are conditioned upon the closing of the ERI/CEC Merger, and such transactions
and the ERI/CEC Merger are both subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. ERI has
publicly disclosed that it expects the ERI/CEC Merger to be completed in the first half of 2020. However, we can
provide no assurances that the ERI/CEC Merger or such other transactions described herein will close in the
anticipated timeframe, on the contemplated terms or at all.

We intend to fund the remaining portions of the Eldorado Transaction that have not yet been consummated
with a combination of proceeds received upon settlement of the forward sale agreements constituting part of the
June 2019 equity offering and with the proceeds from this offering. VICI PropCo, our indirect wholly owned
subsidiary, entered into a commitment letter (as amended from time to time, the “Commitment Letter”) with
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch (together with Bank of America,
N.A., BofA Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., Citizens Bank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC,
Suntrust Bank, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., UBS AG, Stamford Branch, UBS Securities LLC, Credit Suisse
Loan Funding LLC, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch and Stifel Bank & Trust, which each subsequently
joined the Commitment Letter, collectively, the “Bridge Lenders”), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, the Bridge Lenders have agreed to provide (i) a 364-day first lien secured bridge facility
of up to $3.3 billion in the aggregate and (ii) a 364-day second lien secured bridge facility of up to $1.5 billion in the
aggregate (collectively, the “Bridge Facilities”), for the purpose of providing a portion of the financing necessary to
fund the consideration to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Eldorado Transaction documents and related fees and
expenses. Following the issuance of the Existing Senior Notes, the commitments under the Bridge Facilities were
reduced by $1.55 billion, to $3.21 billion. Following the issuance of the notes, we expect to further reduce the
commitments under the Bridge Facilities by $2.0 billion. No loans are outstanding under the Bridge Facilities.

We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a
change of control offer required by the indentures relating to the notes
or the terms of our other indebtedness.”

**Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The indenture will contain covenants that, among other things, will
limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

                        - incur additional indebtedness and use our or their assets to
secure our or their indebtedness;

                         - create certain liens;

                       - make certain restricted payments;

                        - enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments
from our restricted subsidiaries to us;

                       - issue guarantees;

                        - make certain sales and other dispositions of assets;

                        - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; or

                         - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our
assets.

The indenture will also provide that the Co-Issuer will not hold any
material assets, become liable for any material obligations or engage
in any significant business activities, subject to certain exceptions
(including for obligations under the Existing Senior Notes and certain
other notes, including the notes offered hereby). See “Description of
the Notes—Restrictions on activities of the Co-Issuer.”

These covenants contain important exceptions, limitations and
qualifications. For more details, see “Description of the Notes.”

**Covenant Suspension . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Many of the covenants contained in the indentures governing the
notes and the guarantees of the notes will not apply during any period
when the notes are rated investment grade by at least two of Moody’s,
S&P and Fitch and no default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing at that time under the applicable indenture governing the
notes.

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The issuance of the notes has not been registered under the Securities
Act or any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction, and the notes are subject to certain restrictions on
transfer. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering will be
approximately $ after deducting the initial purchasers’
discounts and offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use all or
a portion of the net proceeds from the 2025 Notes to redeem the
$498.5 million of outstanding PropCo Notes in full. We expect to
redeem the PropCo Notes on February 20, 2020 at the redemption
price determined pursuant to the terms of the PropCo Notes, plus
accrued interest to the redemption date. The redemption is
conditioned on the closing of this offering and certain other
customary conditions. We expect to use the net proceeds from the
2027 Notes and the 2030 Notes and the remaining net proceeds, if
any, from the 2025 Notes to consummate the Eldorado Transaction,
with such net proceeds placed in escrow pending the consummation
of the Eldorado Transaction. See “Use of Proceeds.”

If a special mandatory redemption is required, we intend to use the
net proceeds placed in escrow pending consummation of the Eldorado
Transaction for a redemption of the Special Mandatory Redemption
Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Special mandatory
redemption” for a more detailed description of the conditions under
which we are required to redeem the Special Mandatory Redemption
Notes.

To the extent the Specified MTA Transactions close, but any of the
MTA Properties Acquisitions does not, any net proceeds that we
placed in escrow pending the consummation of such MTA Properties
Acquisition would be available to finance future acquisitions, repay
debt under the PropCo Credit Facilities and for general corporate
purposes.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are
holders of the PropCo Notes redeemed and as a result will receive a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering upon redemption of the
PropCo Notes.

**Risk Factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** See “Risk Factors” and the other information included or incorporated
by reference in this offering memorandum for a discussion of the
factors you should carefully consider before deciding to invest in the
notes.

**No Listing of the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We do not intend to apply to list the notes on any securities exchange
or to have the notes quoted on any automated quotation system.

**Governing Law . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes and indentures will be governed by New York law.

consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 have been derived from, and
should be read together with, Holdings’ audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and the
section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” each
of which is included in Holdings’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which is
incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. See “Available Information and Incorporation by
Reference.”

The summary historical consolidated financial information for each of the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the balance sheet data as of September 30, 2019 have been derived from, and
should be read together with, Holdings’ unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes and the
section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” each
of which is included in Holdings’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019,
which is incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. In the view of Holdings and its subsidiaries,
the unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the interim periods. Interim results
for the nine months ended and as of September 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of, and are not projections
for, the results to be expected for any future period.

The following tables also set forth (i) certain summary pro forma consolidated and combined financial data
as of September 30, 2019 and (ii) certain summary pro forma consolidated and combined financial data of
Holdings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, which were calculated by subtracting the pro forma
consolidated and combined financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from the pro forma
consolidated and combined financial data for the year ended December 31, 2018, and adding the pro forma
consolidated and combined financial data for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, in each case reflecting
certain pro forma adjustments that are described below in summary and more fully in the section entitled
“Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated and Combined Financial Data of Holdings,” which is contained elsewhere
in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated and combined balance sheet information of Holdings gives effect to
(i) the recently completed Century Portfolio Acquisition, (ii) the Debt and Equity Transactions (as defined
below), (iii) the JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition and (iv) the Eldorado Transaction, including the
issuance of the notes in this offering and the issuance of the Existing Senior Notes, as if each such transaction
had been completed as of September 30, 2019, as these transactions were not reflected in Holdings’ balance sheet
as of September 30, 2019, and is not necessarily indicative of what Holdings’ financial position would have been
if such transactions had actually been completed on September 30, 2019 and is not intended to project such
information for any future date. The unaudited pro forma consolidated and combined statements of operations
information give effect to (i) the Recently Completed Transactions (as defined below), (ii) the Debt and Equity
Transactions, (iii) the JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition, and (iv) the Eldorado Transaction, including
the issuance of the notes in this offering and the issuance of the Existing Senior Notes, as if each such transaction
had been completed on January 1, 2018 and is not necessarily indicative of what Holdings’ operating results and
other data would have been if such transactions had actually been if such transactions had actually been
completed on January 1, 2018 and is not intended to project such information for any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Before you decide to invest in the notes, you should be aware that investment in the notes carries various_
_risks, including those described below, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_
_position, results of operations and cash flows. We urge you to carefully consider these risk factors, together with_
_all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, before you_
_decide to invest in the notes. In addition, we identify other factors that could affect our business in our Annual_
_Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (including any amendments thereto), in our_
_subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including any amendments thereto), and in our other filings with_
_the Commission, all of which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum as described under_
_“Available Information and Incorporation by Reference.” If any of these risks occur, our business, results of_
_operations, financial condition, cash flows and prospects and our ability to make distributions to our_
_stockholders and to satisfy our debt service obligations may be materially and adversely affected._

**Risks related to this offering and the notes**

**_We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and expect to incur significant additional indebtedness in_**
**_connection with the closing of the Eldorado Transaction and our other pending acquisitions. Our substantial_**
**_indebtedness exposes us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, limits our operating flexibility,_**
**_increases the risks associated with a downturn in our business or in the businesses of our tenants, requires us_**
**_to use a substantial portion of our cash to service our debt obligations, and could prevent us from fulfilling_**
**_our obligations under the notes and our other debt._**

As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis, assuming the completion of this offering and the
anticipated use of proceeds therefrom, the Eldorado Transaction and our other pending and recently completed
acquisitions, offerings and other transactions as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements of Holdings,” Holdings and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis would have
had approximately $6.85 billion principal amount of debt outstanding, consisting of:

    - $2.1 billion of total indebtedness outstanding under the PropCo Term Loan B Facility;

    - $2.25 billion of total indebtedness outstanding under the Existing Senior Notes; and

    - $2.5 billion of total indebtedness outstanding under the notes offered hereby.

In addition, as of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis, we would have $1.0 billion available for
borrowing under our PropCo Revolving Credit Facility.

Payments of principal and interest under our indebtedness, or any other indebtedness that we may incur in
the future, may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pursue our business and growth strategies or to pay
the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our
substantial outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness, and the limitations imposed on us by our debt
agreements, could have other significant adverse consequences, including the following:

    - our cash flow may be insufficient to make our required principal and interest payments on the notes or
on our other indebtedness;

    - our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments may be increased;

    - we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, which could, among
other things, adversely affect our ability to capitalize upon emerging acquisition opportunities,
including exercising our rights of first refusal and call rights described herein, or meet operational
needs;

    - we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less
favorable than the terms of the indebtedness being refinanced;

22


-----

    - we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties if permitted under the Lease Agreements,
possibly on disadvantageous terms at a loss;

    - we may fail to comply with the payment and restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would
entitle the lenders to accelerate payment of outstanding loans and foreclose on any properties securing
such loans; and

    - we may be unable to hedge our debt, counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under our hedge
agreements and these agreements may not effectively hedge interest rate fluctuation risk.

If any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, and our
ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the
foreclosure on our properties could create REIT taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, which
could result in entity-level taxes to us or could adversely affect Holdings’ ability to meet the distribution
requirements necessary to maintain Holdings’ qualification as a REIT.

In addition, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) generally requires that a REIT
distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (with certain adjustments),
determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax
at the regular corporate rate to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100% of its REIT taxable income,
including capital gains. In order to maintain Holdings’ status as a REIT and avoid or otherwise minimize current
entity-level U.S. federal income taxes, a substantial portion of Holdings’ cash flow after operating expenses and
debt service will be required to be distributed to its stockholders.

Because of the limitations on the amount of cash available to us after satisfying our debt service obligations
and our distribution requirements to maintain Holdings’ status as a REIT and avoid or otherwise minimize
current entity-level U.S. federal income taxes, our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies will be
limited.

**_Covenants in our debt agreements may limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach or default_**
**_could materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations._**

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain, and the indentures governing the notes and other future
agreements governing our indebtedness will contain, covenants, including restrictions on our ability to grant liens
on our assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or
consolidations, engage in transactions with affiliates and pay certain distributions and other restricted payments.
In addition, we are required to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants under certain of our debt
agreements. These restrictions and any other restrictions contained in future agreements governing our
indebtedness could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our operational flexibility.
These covenants as well as defaults under our current and future debt instruments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

**_To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which depends on many factors_**
**_beyond our control._**

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available to us under our existing PropCo Revolving Credit Facility or otherwise in amounts
sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, including with respect to the notes and our other indebtedness.
In addition, if we consummate significant acquisitions in the future, our cash requirements may increase
significantly. As we are required to, or expected to be required to, satisfy amortization requirements under our
indebtedness or as other debt matures, we may also need to raise funds to refinance all or a portion of our debt.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including the existing PropCo Credit
Agreement, Existing Senior Notes and the notes, on attractive terms, commercially reasonable terms or at all.

23


-----

Our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance the notes and to service, extend or
refinance our other debt, including our existing PropCo Credit Agreement, Existing Senior Notes and the notes,
will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are
beyond our control.

**_The notes are unsecured. Therefore, our secured creditors would have a prior claim, ahead of the notes, on_**
**_our assets, which could adversely affect your ability to recover the value of your investment in the notes in_**
**_restructuring or bankruptcy proceedings._**

The notes are unsecured. As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors in a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization or similar proceeding relating to us or our property, the holders of our or our subsidiaries’ secured
debt will be entitled to be paid in full from our assets securing that secured debt before any payment may be
made with respect to the notes. In addition, if we or our subsidiaries fail to meet payment or other obligations
under such secured debt, the holders of that secured debt would be entitled to foreclose on our assets securing
that secured debt and liquidate those assets. Accordingly, we may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due
on the notes. As a result, you may lose a portion of or the entire value of your investment in the notes.

As of September 30, 2019, on a pro forma basis, assuming the completion of this offering and the
anticipated use of proceeds therefrom, the Eldorado Transaction and our other pending acquisitions and
transactions as described under “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of
Holdings,” out of the approximately $6.85 billion principal amount of pro forma total indebtedness, $2.1 billion
would have been secured indebtedness that is effectively senior to the notes, and we also would have additional
availability for borrowing under our PropCo Revolving Credit Facility (subject to, among other things,
compliance with the financial covenants under our PropCo Revolving Credit Facility).

**_The notes will be structurally subordinated to liabilities of current and future subsidiaries that do not_**
**_guarantee the notes._**

The notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of any subsidiary that does
not guarantee the notes, and the claims of creditors of those subsidiaries will have priority as to the assets and
cash flows of those subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar
proceeding of any of these subsidiaries, holders of their liabilities (including trade creditors and preferred
stockholders, if any) will generally be entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before
any assets are made available for distribution to us.

Our non-guarantor Subsidiaries accounted for: (i) 6.6% of our revenue for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2019 (or 6.4% of the revenue of Holdings) and (ii) 5.8% of our total assets (or 5.5% of the total
assets of Holdings).

**_Holders of the notes will not have a claim against the assets of Holdings or its subsidiaries other than the_**
**_Operating Partnership and the subsidiary guarantors and should not rely upon Holdings to make payments_**
**_with respect to the notes._**

Neither Holdings nor its taxable REIT subsidiary that operates four golf courses, VICI Golf, will be a
guarantor of the notes. Holders of the notes will only have a claim against the assets of the Issuers and the
subsidiary guarantors. Holders of the notes will not have a claim against the assets of Holdings or its subsidiaries
other than the Issuers and the subsidiary guarantors and should not rely upon Holdings to make payments with
respect to the notes. For more information about the material differences between the financial statements of
Holdings and the financial information of the Operating Partnership and the Co-Issuer, see “Material Differences
between the Consolidated Financial Statements of Holdings and the Financial Information of the Issuers.”

-----

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer required by the_**
**_indentures relating to the notes or the terms of our other indebtedness._**

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, a default could occur in respect of the PropCo Credit
Agreement and we may be required to make an offer to purchase all outstanding notes, the Existing Senior Notes
and the PropCo Notes (if not yet redeemed). If such a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that
we would have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price for all the notes tendered by the holders or such other
indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase of notes upon a Change of Control.”

The PropCo Credit Agreement, the Existing Senior Notes and the PropCo Notes contain, and any future
agreements relating to indebtedness to which we become a party may contain, provisions restricting our ability to
purchase the notes or providing that an occurrence of a change of control constitutes an event of default, or
otherwise requiring payment of amounts borrowed under those agreements. If such a change of control occurs at
a time when we are prohibited from purchasing the notes under such agreements, we could seek the consent of
our then existing lenders and other creditors to the purchase of the notes or could attempt to refinance the
indebtedness that contains the prohibition. If we do not obtain such a consent or repay such indebtedness, we
would remain prohibited from purchasing the notes. In that case, our failure to purchase tendered notes would
constitute a default under the terms of the indentures governing the notes and any other indebtedness that we may
enter into from time to time with similar provisions.

**_You may be required to sell your notes if any gaming authority finds you unsuitable to hold them or otherwise_**
**_requires us to redeem or repurchase the notes from you._**

In the event that any of the applicable regulatory agencies or authorities requires you, as a holder of the
notes, to be licensed, qualified or found suitable under the applicable gaming or racing laws, and you fail to do
so, if required, we will have the right, at our option, to redeem or repurchase your notes. There can be no
assurance that we will have sufficient funds or otherwise will be able to repurchase any or all of your notes. See
“Description of the Notes—Gaming redemption.”

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not intend to register the notes under_**
**_applicable securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes._**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and are subject to restrictions on transferability
and resale. The notes are being offered in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, the notes may be transferred and resold only in a transaction
registered under or exempt from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The
holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to register the notes for resale or otherwise. We have not
agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the notes and do not have any intention to do so. See
“Description of the Notes—No registration rights.” You may be required to bear the risk of your investment for
an indefinite period of time. See “Notice to Investors.”

**_Illiquidity and an absence of a public market for the notes could cause purchasers of the notes to be unable to_**
**_resell the notes._**

The notes constitute a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. We do not
intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for quotation of the notes on any automated
dealer quotation system. An active trading market for the notes may not develop or, if such market develops, it
could be very illiquid. We have been informed by certain of the initial purchasers that they intend to make a
market in the notes after the offering is completed. The initial purchasers are not obligated to do so and may
cease their market-making at any time without notice.

Holders of the notes may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, the notes. The notes are
being offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers and to persons

25


-----

outside the United States and are subject to restrictions on transfer, which are described in the “Notice to
Investors” section. If no active trading market develops, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be
adversely affected, and you may not be able to resell your notes at their fair market value, at the initial offering
price or at all. If a trading market develops for the notes, future trading prices of the notes will depend on many
factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results, liquidity of the issue, the
market for similar securities and other factors, including our financial condition and prospects and the financial
condition and prospects for companies in our industry. Any such trading market for the notes may be
discontinued at any time.

**_Changes in our credit rating could adversely affect the market price or liquidity of the notes and may increase_**
**_our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital._**

Our debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and there can be no assurance that any rating assigned
by the rating agencies will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the
rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. The credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and
may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall view of our industry. A negative change in our
ratings could have an adverse effect on the price of the notes and may increase our future borrowing costs and
reduce access to capital, which could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of
operations.

**_United States federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the notes, the_**
**_guarantees and certain other transfers, to require holders of the notes to return payments or other value_**
**_received from us and to otherwise cancel transfers, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the_**
**_notes._**

Our creditors or the creditors of our subsidiary guarantors could challenge the issuance of the notes or the
subsidiary guarantors’ issuance of their guarantees as fraudulent conveyances or on other grounds. Under U.S.
federal bankruptcy law and similar provisions of state fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws, the issuance of
the notes or the delivery of the guarantees could be avoided if a court determined that we, at the time we issued
the notes:

    - issued the notes with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or

    - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes and (1) were
insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence, (2) were engaged in a business or
transaction for which our or such guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital,
or (3) intended to incur, or believed that we would incur, debts beyond our or such guarantor’s ability
to pay such debts as they matured.

A court would likely find that we or a subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or
fair consideration for the notes or the guarantee, as applicable, if we or such subsidiary guarantor, as applicable,
did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the notes or guarantee’s issuance. If the notes or
guarantees thereon were avoided or limited as a fraudulence conveyance, any claim you may make against us or
the subsidiary guarantors for amounts payable on the notes or guarantees would be unenforceable to the extent of
such voidance or limitation.

The test for determining solvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending on the
law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, a court would
consider an issuer or a guarantor insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the value of its
property, at a fair valuation;

26


-----

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

If a court voided our and the subsidiary guarantors’ obligations under the notes, holders of the notes would
cease to be our creditors and likely have no source from which to recover amounts due under the notes.

Under certain circumstances, a court might direct you to repay amounts received on account of the notes or
the guarantees or otherwise take actions detrimental to the holders of the notes on equitable or other grounds.

**_We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted and may in the future designate other_**
**_subsidiaries as unrestricted, in which case they are not or would not be subject to the restrictive covenants in_**
**_the indentures governing the notes._**

We have designated certain subsidiaries as unrestricted, see “Description of the Notes—Certain definitions,”
and we may designate in the future other subsidiaries as unrestricted. Any such subsidiaries are not subject to the
restrictive covenants in the indentures governing the notes offered hereby. This means that these entities are able
to engage in many of the activities that we and our restricted subsidiaries are prohibited or limited from doing
under the terms of the indentures governing the notes, such as incurring additional debt, securing assets, paying
dividends, making investments and entering into mergers or other business combinations. These actions could be
detrimental to our ability to make payments of principal and interest when due and to comply with our other
obligations under the notes, and could reduce the amount of our assets that would be available to satisfy your
claims should we default on the notes.

**_Many of the covenants contained in the indentures governing the notes will not be applicable during any_**
**_period when the notes are rated investment grade by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default or_**
**_event of default has occurred and is continuing at that time._**

Many of the covenants contained in the indentures governing the notes will not apply to us during any
period when the notes are rated investment grade by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default or
event of default has occurred and is continuing at that time under the applicable indenture governing the notes.
Any covenants that cease to apply to us as a result of achieving these ratings will be restored if the notes are no
longer rated investment grade by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. These covenants restrict, among other
things, our ability to pay dividends, incur debt and to enter into certain other transactions. We cannot predict
whether the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, whether the
notes will maintain such ratings. However, the lack of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain
actions that would not have been permitted while these covenants were in force. If the covenants are later
restored, the actions taken while the covenants were suspended will not result in an event of default under the
applicable indenture even if they would constitute an event of default at the time the covenants are restored. Any
lowering, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or
marketability of the notes. See “Description of the Notes—Covenant suspension.”

**_We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, and this could further exacerbate_**
**_the risks described in this offering memorandum._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the
instruments that govern our existing indebtedness, including the PropCo Credit Agreement and the indentures
governing the Existing Senior Notes, allow us, and the indentures governing the notes offered hereby will allow us,
to issue and incur additional debt upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Subject to the terms of the instruments
governing our indebtedness, including the indentures governing the notes offered hereby, we may recapitalize, incur

27


-----

additional indebtedness and take a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to
make payments on the notes when due. As of September 30, 2019, we had $1.0 billion available for borrowing
under our PropCo Revolving Credit Facility (subject to, among other things, compliance with the financial
covenants under our PropCo Revolving Credit Facility).

**_If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, holders of notes may receive a lesser amount for their_**
**_claim than they would have been entitled to receive under the indentures governing the notes._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the
notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount of the notes may be limited to an amount
equal to the original issue price for the notes.

**_We may redeem your notes at our option, which may adversely affect your return._**

We may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at our option at any time or from time to time at the
applicable redemption prices described in this offering memorandum. Prevailing interest rates at the time we
redeem the notes may be lower than the interest rate on the notes. As a result, you may not be able to reinvest the
redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an interest rate equal to or higher than the interest rate on the
notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional redemption” for a more detailed description of the conditions
under which we may redeem the notes.

**_In the event that the Specified MTA Transactions are not consummated on or before the MTA Transaction_**
**_Deadline, Holdings determines that the Specified MTA Transactions will not be consummated on or before_**
**_the MTA Transaction Deadline and gives the applicable trustees written notice to that effect or the Master_**
**_Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or by agreement of the parties thereto, the_**
**_Special Mandatory Redemption Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you_**
**_may not obtain the return you expect on the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes._**

Our ability to consummate the Specified MTA Transactions is subject to various closing conditions, many
of which are beyond our control. In the event that the Specified MTA Transactions are not consummated on or
before the MTA Transaction Deadline, Holdings determines that the Specified MTA Transactions will not be
consummated on or before the MTA Transaction Deadline and gives the applicable trustees written notice to that
effect or the Master Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or by agreement of the
parties thereto, then we will be obligated to redeem all of the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date. Upon such
redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields
comparable returns. You may suffer a loss on your investment if you purchase the Special Mandatory
Redemption Notes at a price greater than the issue price of the notes. In addition, as a result of the special
mandatory redemption provisions of the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes, the trading prices of the Special
Mandatory Redemption Notes may not reflect the financial results of our business or macroeconomic factors.
You will have no rights under the special mandatory redemption provisions as long as the Specified MTA
Transactions are consummated by the MTA Transaction Deadline, nor will you have any right to require us to
repurchase your Special Mandatory Redemption Notes if, between the closing of the notes offering and the
closing of the Specified MTA Transactions, we experience any changes (including material changes) in our
business or financial condition, or if the terms of the Master Transaction Agreement change, including in
material respects. See “Description of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption” for a more detailed description
of the conditions under which we are required to redeem the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes.

-----

**_To the extent we close the Specified MTA Transactions on or before the MTA Transaction Deadline, but we_**
**_do not close one or more of the MTA Properties Acquisitions, you will have no rights under the special_**
**_mandatory redemption provisions with respect to such MTA Properties Acquisition(s)._**

The closing of the Specified MTA Transactions is not conditioned on the completion of any or all of the MTA
Properties Acquisitions, nor is the closing of any one MTA Properties Acquisition conditioned upon the closing of
any other MTA Properties Acquisition. As a result, it is possible we may not be able to consummate one or all of the
MTA Properties Acquisitions, even if we consummate the closing Specified MTA Transactions pursuant to the
Master Transaction Agreement. To the extent the Specified MTA Transactions close, but any one of the MTA
Properties Acquisitions does not, the net proceeds that were placed in escrow pending the consummation of such
MTA Properties Acquisition will be available to finance future acquisitions, repay debt under the PropCo Credit
Facilities and for general corporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**_We may be unable to redeem the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes in the event of a special mandatory_**
**_redemption._**

Even though we are required under the Commitment Letter to place the net proceeds of the offering of any
Special Mandatory Redemption Notes in escrow pending the consummation of the Eldorado Transaction, there is
no such requirement under the terms of the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes and there are no other
restrictions on our use of such proceeds during this time. In the event we do not place any of the proceeds from
the offering of the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes in escrow, we would need to fund a special mandatory
redemption using proceeds that we have voluntarily retained and from other sources of liquidity, including
borrowings under the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will
have sufficient funds to redeem the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes in the event of a special mandatory
redemption, which would constitute an event of default under the applicable indentures and could result in
defaults under our other debt agreements and have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the
Special Mandatory Redemption Notes.

**_If we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the notes._**

If there is any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the PropCo Credit
Agreement or the indentures governing the Existing Senior Notes, that is not waived by the required lenders or
noteholders, the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could result in us being unable to pay
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes and substantially decrease the market value of the notes. If
we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet
required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to
comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our
indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event
of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be
due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, the lenders under our credit facilities could
elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings
against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines,
we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our credit facilities to avoid being in
default. If such waivers were not obtained, we would be in default under our credit facilities, the lenders could
exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_Under certain circumstances, subsidiary guarantees may be released._**

Those subsidiaries that provide, or will provide, guarantees of the notes will be released from such
guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events, including the following:

    - a sale or other disposition, including by way of consolidation or merger or the sale of its capital stock,
of such subsidiary guarantor;

    - the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the such subsidiary guarantor;

29


-----

    - the designation of such subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary (as defined in the applicable
indenture governing the notes of the applicable series);

    - if a subsidiary guarantor’s obligations as a borrower or guarantor under the PropCo Credit Agreement,
certain other credit facilities or other capital markets indebtedness terminate pursuant to the terms of
the PropCo Credit Agreement or such other indebtedness, or if the PropCo Credit Agreement or such
other indebtedness is amended to remove certain or all of the subsidiary guarantors as borrowers or
guarantors; or

    - the defeasance or discharge of the applicable series of notes, as provided under the provisions of the
applicable indenture.

If any such subsidiary guarantee is released, no holder of the notes of the applicable series will have a claim
as a creditor against any such subsidiary and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and
preferred stock, if any, of such subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes of
the applicable series. See “Description of the Notes—Brief description of the notes and the Note Guarantees—
The Note Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—Future guarantors.”

**_The unaudited pro forma consolidated and combined financial statements contained in this offering_**
**_memorandum are presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be reflective of Holdings’ results of_**
**_operations and financial condition following completion of the pro forma events._**

The unaudited pro forma consolidated and combined financial statements contained in this offering
memorandum are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what Holdings’
actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the pro forma events been completed on
the dates indicated, and do not reflect what Holdings’ financial condition and results of operations will be in the
future. Further, Holdings’ actual results of operations and financial condition after the pro forma events may
differ materially and adversely from the unaudited pro forma consolidated and combined financial statements
that are included in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma consolidated and combined financial
statements include numerous assumptions that may prove to be incorrect.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect the net proceeds from this offering to be approximately $, after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discounts and our estimated offering expenses. We intend to use all or a portion of the net proceeds
from the 2025 Notes to redeem the outstanding PropCo Notes in full. We expect to redeem the PropCo Notes on
February 20, 2020 at the redemption price determined pursuant to the terms of the PropCo Notes, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date. The redemption is conditioned on the closing of this offering and certain other
customary conditions. The PropCo Notes bear interest at 8.0% per annum and mature on October 15, 2023. The
total applicable premium in connection with the redemption of the PropCo Notes, which we expect to pay with
available cash from our balance sheet, is expected to be approximately $39 million. We expect to use the net
proceeds from the 2027 Notes and the 2030 Notes and the remaining net proceeds, if any, from the 2025 Notes
after the redemption of the PropCo Notes to consummate the Eldorado Transaction, with such net proceeds
placed in escrow pending the consummation of the Eldorado Transaction.

If (i) the Specified MTA Transactions are not consummated on or before the MTA Transaction Deadline,
(ii) Holdings determines that the Specified MTA Transactions will not be consummated on or before the MTA
Transaction Deadline and gives the applicable trustees written notice to that effect or (iii) the Master Transaction
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or by agreement of the parties thereto, then we will be
obligated to redeem all outstanding Special Mandatory Redemption Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the special mandatory redemption date. If a special mandatory redemption is required, we
intend to use the net proceeds placed in escrow pending consummation of the Eldorado Transaction for such
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Special mandatory redemption” for a more detailed description of
the conditions under which we are required to redeem the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes. To the extent
the Specified MTA Transactions close, but any of the MTA Properties Acquisitions does not, any net proceeds
that we placed in escrow pending the consummation of such MTA Properties Acquisition would be available to
finance future acquisitions, repay debt under the PropCo Credit Facilities and for general corporate purposes.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are holders of the PropCo Notes redeemed and
as a result will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering upon redemption of the PropCo Notes.

The assumptions used and pro forma adjustments derived from such assumptions are based on currently
available information, and in many cases are based on estimates and preliminary information. The assumptions
underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma
consolidated and combined financial statements of Holdings. We believe such assumptions are reasonable under
the circumstances and reflect our best currently available estimates and judgments. However, no assurance can
be given that the JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition or the Eldorado Transaction will occur on the terms
or timing contemplated herein, or at all. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma consolidated and combined
financial statements are not reflective of Holdings’ future financial condition or results of operations and do not
necessarily reflect what our financial condition or results of operations would have been had the transactions to
which the pro forma adjustments relate actually occurred on the dates indicated.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated and combined financial statements are derived from and should be
read in conjunction with Holdings’ consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Holdings’
Annual Report and Holdings’ consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Holdings’ Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

**Note 1—Balance Sheet Pro Forma Adjustments**

(a) Represents the balance sheet of Holdings as of September 30, 2019, as set forth in Holdings’ Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019.

(b) Represents:

       - The Century Portfolio Acquisition accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842

The JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition as follows:

       - The JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Lease Agreement was accounted for entirely as a financing
receivable in accordance with ASC 310—Receivables. The transaction met the definition of a
sales-type lease under ASC 842, and it further met the definition of a sale leaseback transaction
under ASC 842, under which the lease is accounted for as a financing in accordance with
ASC 310—Receivables.

       - The JACK Cleveland loan accounted for as a financing receivable under ASC 310—Receivables.

The Eldorado Transaction as follows:

       - Upon the CPLV Additional Rent Acquisition, HLV Additional Rent Acquisition and resulting
modification of the related leases, the CPLV Lease Agreement was reassessed and both the land
and building components of the modified CPLV Lease Agreement were determined to be salestype leases. As such, the land component, previously determined to be an operating lease, was
reclassified as a sales-type lease.

       - The MTA Properties Acquisition was accounted for entirely as a financing receivable in
accordance with ASC 310—Receivables. The transaction met the definition of a sales-type lease
under ASC 842, and it further met the definition of a sale leaseback transaction under ASC 842,
under which the lease is accounted for as a financing in accordance with ASC 310—Receivables.

       - The amendments to the Joliet Lease Agreement and Non-CPLV Lease Agreement were
determined to meet the definition of a modification under ASC 842. In accordance with
modification guidance, the lease classifications were reassessed and the land and building
components of the leases were determined to be sales-type leases. The operating land associated
with the Non-CPLV Lease Agreement, previously classified as an Investment in operating leases,
was reclassified as sales-type lease upon modification.

These investments are inclusive of an estimated $23.4 million of capitalized initial direct costs and loan
origination fees that Holdings and its subsidiaries anticipate incurring in connection with these
transactions, including the previously incurred costs noted in (d) below

(c) Represents:

       - the cash and short-term investments used to pay for the aggregate purchase price of the Century
Portfolio Acquisition and a portion of the aggregate purchase price of the JACK Cleveland/
Thistledown Acquisition and Eldorado Transaction;

       - the net cash payment of the fees and expenses related to the redemption and refinancing of the
PropCo Notes;

       - the estimated net proceeds from the physical settlement of the 65,000,000 shares of common stock
associated with the forward sale agreements at the forward settlement price of $20.22 per share
(the forward price as of September 30, 2019);

       - the release of restricted cash held in escrow upon the refinancing of the CMBS CPLV Debt; and

       - the payment of the bridge commitment and structuring fees upon termination of the Bridge
Facilities.

41


-----

(d) Represents:

       - $28.6 million payment of the bridge commitment and structuring fee.

       - $15.5 million in unamortized costs relating to the bridge commitment and structuring fee.

       - $8.1 million reclassification of previously incurred deferred costs associated with the Century
Portfolio Acquisition, JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition and Eldorado Transaction as
Investments in direct financing and sales-type leases;

(e) Represents:

       - $2,500.0 million of notes issued in this offering, the net proceeds of which will be used to redeem
the outstanding PropCo Notes in full and to pay a portion of the purchase prices for the Eldorado
Transaction.

       - $2,250.0 million of Existing Senior Notes issued in the November 2019 offering, the net proceeds
of which were used to repay in full the CPLV CMBS Debt and the remainder of which will be
used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the JACK Cleveland/Thistledown Acquisition.

These borrowings are net of $74.8 million of deferred financing costs, of which $35.9 was previously
incurred in relation to our Existing Senior Notes offering and $38.9 million that we anticipate incurring
in connection with the current notes offering. See paragraph (gg) and (kk) to Note 2—Statements of
Operations Pro Forma Adjustments below.

(f) Represents the net proceeds upon full physical settlement of the 65,000,000 shares of common stock
associated with the forward sale agreements at the forward settlement price of $20.22 per share (the
forward price as of September 30, 2019). The actual net proceeds that Holdings will receive from the
settlement of the forward sales agreements will be based on numerous factors, including the settlement
method and the forward sale price at the time of settlement. As a result, the actual net proceeds from
the sale will likely differ from the net proceeds estimated for purposes of these unaudited pro forma
consolidated and combined financial statements.

(g) Represents the adjustment to retained earnings from the non-recurring items as follows:

       - $39.2 million loss from extinguishment of debt as a result of the redemption and refinancing of
the PropCo Notes in connection with this offering.

       - $31.9 million, which represents Holdings’ share of the $42.6 million gain on lease modification as
a result of the Subsequent Lease Modifications with the Eldorado Transactions. Such amounts are
recognized as the difference between the carrying value of the net investment in direct financing
leases or operating leases and the fair value of the net investment in sales-type leases subsequent
to modification.

       - $58.0 million loss from extinguishment of debt as a result of the CPLV CMBS Debt refinancing.

       - $15.5 million representing the full amortization of the bridge structuring and commitment fees as
described in (d) above.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**PropCo Credit Facilities**

In December 2017, VICI PropCo entered into a credit agreement (the “PropCo Credit Agreement”) comprised
of a $2.2 billion PropCo Term Loan B Facility and a $400.0 million PropCo Revolving Credit Facility (the PropCo
Term Loan B Facility and the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility, as amended as discussed below, are referred to
together as the “PropCo Credit Facilities”). The PropCo Credit Facilities initially bore interest at the London
Interbank Overnight Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 2.25%. Upon Holdings’ initial public offering, on February 5, 2018, the
interest rate was reduced to LIBOR plus 2.00%, as contemplated by the PropCo Credit Agreement. As a result of
our repayment of $100.0 million principal amount of the PropCo Term Loan B Facility in February 2018,
$2.1 billion of total indebtedness is currently outstanding under the PropCo Term Loan B Facility.

On May 15, 2019, VICI PropCo entered into Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment No. 2”) to the PropCo Credit
Agreement, pursuant to which certain lenders agreed to provide VICI PropCo with incremental revolving credit
commitments and availability under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of
$600.0 million on the same terms as VICI PropCo’s current revolving credit facility under the Revolving Credit
Facility. After giving effect to Amendment No. 2, the PropCo Credit Agreement provided total borrowing
capacity pursuant to the revolving credit commitments in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion.

On May 15, 2019, immediately after giving effect to Amendment No. 2, VICI PropCo entered into
Amendment No. 3 (“Amendment No. 3”) to the PropCo Credit Agreement, which amended and restated the PropCo
Credit Agreement in its entirety as of May 15, 2019 (the “Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement”) to,
among other things, (i) refinance the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility in whole with a new class of revolving
commitments, (ii) extend the maturity date of the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility from December 22, 2022 to
May 15, 2024, (iii) provide that borrowings under the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility will accrue based on a
leverage-based pricing grid with a range of between 1.75% to 2.00% over LIBOR, or between 0.75% and 1.00%
over the base rate, in each case depending on the total net debt to adjusted total assets ratio of VICI PropCo and its
restricted subsidiaries (the “VICI PropCo Group”), (iv) provide that the commitment fee payable under the PropCo
Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate based on a leverage-based pricing grid with a range of between
0.375% to 0.50% depending on VICI PropCo Group’s total net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, (v) amend the
existing springing financial covenant, which previously required VICI PropCo to maintain a total net debt to
adjusted asset ratio of not more than 0.75 to 1.00 (or, during any fiscal quarter in which certain permitted
acquisitions were consummated and the three consecutive fiscal quarters thereafter, not more than 0.80 to 1.00) if
utilization of the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 30%, to require that, only with respect to the PropCo
Revolving Credit Facility commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ending after the effectiveness of Amendment
No. 3, VICI PropCo maintain a maximum total net debt to adjusted asset ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00 as of
the last day of any fiscal quarter (or, during any fiscal quarter in which certain permitted acquisitions were
consummated and the three consecutive fiscal quarters thereafter, not more than 0.70 to 1.00) regardless of the level
of utilization of the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility, and (vi) include a new financial covenant, only with respect
to the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility, requiring VICI PropCo to maintain, commencing with the first full fiscal
quarter after the effectiveness of Amendment No. 3, an interest coverage ratio (defined as EBITDA to interest
charges) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. The PropCo Revolving Credit Facility
is available to be used for working capital purposes, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions, permitted
investments, permitted restricted payments and for other lawful corporate purposes. The Amended and Restated
PropCo Credit Agreement provides for capacity to add incremental loans in an aggregate amount of: (x) $1.2 billion
to be used solely to finance certain acquisitions; plus (y) an unlimited amount, subject to VICI PropCo not
exceeding certain leverage ratios.

VICI PropCo intends to enter into an amendment to the Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement,
which, among other things, is expected to reduce the interest rate spread on the PropCo Term Loan B Facility,
which is currently LIBOR plus 2.00%, by up to 0.25%.

46


-----

The Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement provides that, in the event LIBOR is no longer in
effect, a comparable or successor rate approved by the Administrative Agent thereunder shall be utilized,
provided that such approved rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice.

The Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that are consistent
with those set forth in the PropCo Credit Agreement (except as to the financial covenants described above),
which, among other things, limit the ability of the VICI PropCo Group to: (i) incur additional indebtedness;
(ii) merge with a third party or engage in other fundamental changes; (iii) make restricted payments; (iv) enter
into, create, incur or assume any liens; (v) make certain sales and other dispositions of assets; (vi) enter into
certain transactions with affiliates; (vii) make certain payments on certain other indebtedness; (viii) make certain
investments; and (ix) incur restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make certain distributions, loans
or transfers of assets to VICI PropCo or any of its restricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a
number of exceptions and qualifications, including, with respect to the restricted payments covenant, the ability
to make unlimited restricted payments to maintain Holdings’ REIT status and to avoid the payment of federal or
state income or excise tax, the ability to make restricted payments in an amount not to exceed 95% of the VICI
PropCo Group’s Funds from Operations (as defined in the Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement)
subject to no event of default under the Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement and pro forma
compliance with the financial covenant pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit PropCo Agreement, and
the ability to make additional restricted payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of 0.6% of
Adjusted Total Assets or $30 million. The VICI PropCo Group is also subject to the financial covenants under
the PropCo Revolving Credit Facility, as previously described above. As of September 30, 2019, the restricted
net assets of VICI PropCo were approximately $6.7 billion.

The PropCo Credit Facilities are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of VICI PropCo’s and its
existing and subsequently acquired wholly owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries’ material assets,
including mortgages on their respective real estate, subject to customary exclusions. None of Holdings, VICI GP,
the Operating Partnership nor the Co-Issuer are subject to the covenants of the Amended and Restated PropCo
Credit Agreement or are guarantors of the PropCo Credit Facilities. The PropCo Term Loan B Facility may be
voluntarily prepaid at VICI PropCo’s option, in whole or in part, at any time, and is subject to mandatory
prepayment in the event of receipt by VICI PropCo or any of its restricted subsidiaries of the proceeds from the
occurrence of certain events, including asset sales, casualty events and issuance of certain indebtedness.

Under the Amended and Restated PropCo Credit Agreement, the PropCo Term Loan B Facility is subject to
amortization of 1.0% of principal per annum payable in equal quarterly installments on the last business day of
each calendar quarter. However, as a result of prepaying $100.0 million of the PropCo Term Loan B Facility in
February 2018, the next principal payment due on the PropCo Term Loan B Facility is September 2022.

**Existing Senior Notes**

On November 26, 2019, the Issuers issued the Existing Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of
$2.25 billion. The Existing 2026 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.25 billion will mature on
December 1, 2026, and the Existing 2029 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion will mature on
December 1, 2029. Interest on the Existing 2026 Notes accrues at a rate of 4.250% per annum, and interest on the
Existing 2029 Notes accrues at a rate of 4.625% per annum. Interest on the Existing Senior Notes will be payable
semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2020. The notes
offered hereby will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Existing Senior Notes.

The Existing Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior

Operating Partnership that incurs or guarantees certain bank indebtedness or any other material capital market
indebtedness, other than certain excluded subsidiaries and the Co-Issuer.

principal amount redeemed in the case of the Existing 2026 Notes and (ii) at a redemption price of 104.625% of
the principal amount redeemed in the case of the Existing 2029 Notes. However, the Issuers may only make such
redemptions if at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the series of Existing Senior Notes issued under
the applicable indenture remains outstanding after the occurrence of such redemption.

The Existing Senior Notes are subject to redemption requirements imposed by gaming laws and regulations.

The Existing Senior Indentures contain customary covenants that are consistent with those in the indentures
governing the notes offered hereby, and that will limit the Issuers’ ability and, in certain instances, the ability of
the Issuers’ subsidiaries, to borrow money, create liens on assets, make distributions and pay dividends on or
redeem or repurchase stock, make certain types of investments, sell stock in certain subsidiaries, enter into
agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries, enter into transactions with affiliates,
issue guarantees of debt, and sell assets or merge with other companies. These limitations are subject to a number
of important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the indentures.

Events of default under the Existing Senior Indentures are consistent with those in the indentures governing
the notes offered hereby, and include, among others, default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on
the applicable series of Existing Senior Notes; default in payment when due of the principal of, or premium, if
any, on the applicable series of Existing Senior Notes; failure to comply with certain covenants in the applicable

debt of the Issuers or a significant subsidiary thereof in excess of a specified amount that remains uncured for 30
days; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency; and certain significant master leases terminating or ceasing to

or insolvency with respect to the Issuers, all Existing Senior Notes then outstanding will become due and payable
immediately without further action or notice. If any other event of default occurs with respect to the applicable
series of Existing Senior Notes, the trustee or holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable
series of Existing Senior Notes may declare all such Existing Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately.

**PropCo Notes**

The PropCo Notes were issued on October 6, 2017, pursuant to an indenture (the “PropCo Note Indenture”)
by and among VICI PropCo and its wholly owned subsidiary, VICI FC Inc. (together, the “PropCo Note

Issuers”), the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, and UMB Bank National Association, as trustee. The PropCo
Notes are guaranteed by each of the PropCo Note Issuers’ existing and subsequently acquired wholly owned
material domestic restricted subsidiaries and secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of the PropCo
Note Issuers’ and such restricted subsidiaries’ material assets, including mortgages on their respective real estate,
subject to customary exclusions. None of Holdings, VICI GP, the Operating Partnership nor the Co-Issuer are
subject to the covenants of the PropCo Note Indenture or are guarantors of the PropCo Notes.

The PropCo Note Indenture contains covenants that limit the PropCo Note Issuers’ and their restricted
subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) pay dividends on or make other
distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments; (iii) make certain investments;
(iv) sell certain assets; (v) create or permit to exist dividend and/or payment restrictions affecting their restricted
subsidiaries; (vi) create liens on certain assets to secure debt; (vii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of their assets; (viii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates; and
(ix) designate their subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of
exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to declare or pay any cash dividend or make any cash
distribution to Holdings to the extent necessary for Holdings to distribute cash dividends of 100% of its “real
estate investment trust taxable income” within the meaning of Section 857(b)(2) of the Code, the ability to make
certain restricted payments not to exceed the amount of the cumulative earnings of VICI PropCo and its
subsidiaries (calculated pursuant to the PropCo Note Indenture as $30 million plus 95% of the cumulative
Adjusted Funds From Operations (as defined in the PropCo Note Indenture) less cumulative distributions, with
certain other adjustments), and the ability to make restricted payments in an amount equal to the greater of 0.6%
of Adjusted Total Assets (as defined in the PropCo Note Indenture) or $30 million.

Prior to October 15, 2020, the PropCo Notes are redeemable at the option of the PropCo Note Issuers, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the PropCo Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date, plus an applicable premium equal to the excess of (a) the
present value of (i) 104% of the principal amount of the PropCo Notes so redeemed plus (ii) all required interest
payments due on such PropCo Notes through October 15, 2020, computed using a discount rate equal to the thenapplicable U.S. Treasury rate plus 50 basis points, over (b) the then-outstanding principal amount of the PropCo
Notes so redeemed. The PropCo Note Issuers also had the option to redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the PropCo Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain issuances of common or preferred
equity by VICI PropCo or Holdings, at a price equal to 108% of such principal amount of the PropCo Notes
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. On or after October 15, 2020, the
PropCo Notes are redeemable at the option of the PropCo Note Issuers, at a redemption price of (a) 104% of the
principal amount of the PropCo Notes so redeemed for the period October 15, 2020 through October 14, 2021
and (b) 100% of the principal amount of the PropCo Notes so redeemed after October 15, 2021, in each case,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

$268.4 million of the PropCo Notes, which represented 35% of the original aggregate principal amount, at a
redemption price of 108% plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Due to the partial
redemption of the PropCo Notes, Holdings recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $23.0 million during
the three months ended March 31, 2018, the majority of which relates to the premium paid on the redemption
price.

We intend to redeem the remaining $498.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the PropCo
Notes with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. We expect to redeem the PropCo Notes on February 20,
2020 at the redemption price determined pursuant to the terms of the PropCo Notes, plus accrued interest to the
redemption date. The redemption is conditioned on the closing of this offering and certain other conditions. The
applicable premium to be paid in connection with the redemption of the PropCo Notes is expected to be
approximately $39 million. This offering memorandum is not a notice of redemption for the PropCo Notes.

Commitments and loans under the Bridge Facilities will be reduced or prepaid, as applicable, in part upon
any issuance by us of equity or notes in a public offering or private placement, including the issuance of the
Existing Senior Notes and this offering, and/or the incurrence of term loans and certain other debt and upon other
specified events prior to the consummation of the Eldorado Transaction, in each case subject to the terms and
certain exceptions set forth in the Commitment Letter, including that the commitments and loans will not be
reduced as a result of the proceeds from common equity offerings. Following the issuance of the Existing Senior
Notes, the commitments under the Bridge Facilities were reduced by $1.55 billion to $3.21 billion. Following the
issuance of the notes, we expect to further reduce the commitments under the Bridge Facilities by $2.0 billion.
No loans are outstanding under the Bridge Facilities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we were to use the Bridge Facilities, funding is contingent on the
satisfaction of certain customary conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, including, among others, (i) the
execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the Bridge Facilities in accordance with the
terms set forth in the Commitment Letter and (ii) the consummation of the applicable transactions in accordance
with the Eldorado Transaction documents. Although we do not currently expect VICI PropCo to make any
borrowings under the Bridge Facilities, there can be no assurance that such borrowings will not be made or that
we will be able to incur alternative long-term debt financing in lieu of borrowings under the Bridge Facilities.
Borrowings under the Bridge Facilities, if any, will bear interest at a floating rate that varies depending on the
duration of the loans thereunder. Under the Eldorado Senior Bridge Facility, interest will be calculated on a rate
between (i) LIBOR plus 200 basis points and LIBOR plus 275 basis or (ii) the base rate plus 100 basis points and
the base rate plus 175 basis points, in each case depending on duration. Under the Eldorado Junior Bridge
Facility, interest will be calculated on a rate between (x) LIBOR plus 300 basis points and LIBOR plus 375 basis
or (y) the base rate plus 200 basis points and the base rate plus 275 basis points, in each case depending on
duration. The Bridge Facilities, if funded, will contain restrictive covenants and events of default substantially
similar to those contained in, with respect to the Eldorado Senior Bridge Facility, the PropCo Credit Facilities
and, with respect to the Eldorado Junior Bridge Facility, the PropCo Credit Facilities, with modifications to
baskets and thresholds to be consistent with the PropCo Notes. If we draw upon the Bridge Facilities, there can
be no assurances that we would be able to refinance the Bridge Facilities on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.

**Financial Covenants**

As described above, our debt obligations are subject to certain customary financial and protective covenants
that restrict the Issuers, VICI PropCo and their subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, sell certain assets and
restrict certain payments, among other things. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and
qualifications, including the ability to make restricted payments to maintain Holdings’ REIT status. At
September 30, 2019, we are in compliance with all required covenants under our debt obligations.

under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”), or subject to the terms of the
Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of the notes include only those stated in the applicable indenture.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indentures. It does not restate the
indentures in their entirety. We urge you to read the indentures because they, and not this description, define your
rights as a holder of the notes. Copies of the indentures are available as set forth below under “—Additional
information.” Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain definitions”
have the meanings assigned to them in the applicable indenture.

The registered holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will
have rights under the indentures.

**Brief description of the notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_The notes. The notes will be:_**

 - senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the Co-Issuer;

 - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior Indebtedness of the Company
and the Co-Issuer, if any;

 - senior in right of payment to all future subordinated Indebtedness of the Company and the Co-Issuer, if any;

 - effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured Indebtedness of the Company
and the Co-Issuer, if any, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness;

 - structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade
payables, of the Company’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries (excluding the Co-Issuer), if any; and

 - fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors on a senior unsecured basis.

**_The Note Guarantees. The notes will initially be guaranteed on a joint and several basis by all of the Company’s_**
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries) and any future Restricted Subsidiaries (other than
Excluded Subsidiaries) that are or become required to issue Note Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described
below under the caption “—Covenants—Limitation on issuances of Guarantees by Subsidiary Guarantors.” The
notes will not be guaranteed by VICI GP or Holdings and neither VICI GP nor Holdings will be subject to the
covenants or conditions contained in the indentures.

51


-----

The Note Guarantees of each Subsidiary Guarantor will be:

 - senior unsecured obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

 - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
Guarantor, if any;

 - senior in right of payment to all future subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, if any; and

 - effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary Guarantor, including the secured Indebtedness under the PropCo Credit Agreement and the
PropCo Notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that Indebtedness.

Not all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or
reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of
their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. On the Issue
Date, the Subsidiary Guarantors will consist of the borrower and all of the guarantors under the PropCo Credit
Agreement, other than VICI FC, which includes all of the Subsidiaries of the Company except for the Co-Issuer
and the Specified Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Our non-guarantor Subsidiaries accounted for: (i) 6.6% of our
revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 (or 6.4% of the revenue of Holdings), and (ii) 5.8% of
our total assets as of September 30, 2019 (or 5.5% of the total assets of Holdings).

As of the date of the indentures, all of our Subsidiaries other than the Specified Unrestricted Subsidiaries will be
“Restricted Subsidiaries” and all of our “Restricted Subsidiaries” are 100% owned. Under the circumstances
described in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” we will be permitted to designate certain additional
Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the
restrictive covenants in the indentures. Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not guarantee the notes.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Subsidiary Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state law. By virtue of this limitation, a Subsidiary Guarantor’s
obligations under its Note Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the notes,
or a Subsidiary Guarantor may have effectively no obligations under its Note Guarantees. See “Risk Factors—
Risks related to this offering and the notes—United States federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific
circumstances, to avoid the notes, the guarantees and certain other transfers, to require holders of the notes to
return payments or other value received from us and to otherwise cancel transfers, and to take other actions
detrimental to the holders of the notes.”

Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment under its Note Guarantees will be entitled upon payment in full
of all guaranteed obligations under the indentures to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in an
amount equal to such other Subsidiary Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net
assets of all the Subsidiary Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

The Note Guarantees of a Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically terminate and be released upon:

(1) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Subsidiary Guarantor, or
the Capital Stock of the Subsidiary Guarantor such that the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary, in a transaction that does not violate the provisions of the indentures described below under the
caption “—Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”;

(2) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor;

(3) the designation in accordance with the indentures of the Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

52


-----

(4) such time as such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a guarantor or other obligor with respect to the
PropCo Credit Agreement, any other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (4)(A) of the covenant
described below under “—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Capital Markets Indebtedness;
or

(5) defeasance or discharge of the notes, as provided under the provisions of the indentures described below
under the captions “—Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge.”

$ aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes, $ aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes and

the applicable indenture from time to time after this offering. Any issuance of additional notes is subject to all of
the covenants in the applicable indenture, including the covenant described below under the caption “
—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Any additional notes subsequently issued will be treated as a single
class with the existing notes of the same series for all purposes under the applicable indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Any such additional notes will either (i) be
fungible with the notes of the same series offered hereby for U.S. Federal income tax purposes or (ii) have a

multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. The 2025 Notes will mature on, 2025, the 2027 Notes will

Interest on the notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the
date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months.

**The Co-Issuer**

The Co-Issuer is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company that was created for the purpose of acting as a
co-issuer in connection with the issuance by the Company of the Existing Senior Notes and certain other notes,
including the notes offered hereby. The Co-Issuer does not have and will not have any substantial operations or
assets and does not have and will not have any revenues. As a result, prospective purchasers of the notes should
not expect the Co-Issuer to participate in servicing the interest and principal obligations on the notes.

**Restrictions on activities of the Co-Issuer**

obligations or engage in any significant business activities, other than issuing the Existing Senior Notes, the notes
offered hereby and other similar notes and engaging in activities as it is required to do pursuant to the Existing
Senior Indentures, the indentures and other similar indentures; provided that the Co-Issuer may issue Equity
Interests to the Company and may be a co-obligor or guarantor with respect to Indebtedness if the Company is a
primary obligor of such Indebtedness and the net proceeds of such Indebtedness are received by the Company or
one or more of the Company’s Subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer), and may engage in activities related
thereto or necessary in connection therewith.

**Gaming redemption**

In addition to the foregoing, if any Gaming Authority requires that a holder or Beneficial Owner of notes must be
licensed, qualified or found suitable under any applicable Gaming Laws and such holder or Beneficial Owner:

(1) fails to apply for a license, qualification or a finding of suitability within 30 days (or such shorter period as
may be required by the applicable Gaming Authority) after being requested to do so by the Gaming
Authority, or

(2) is denied such license or qualification or not found suitable,

or if any Gaming Authority otherwise requires that notes from any holder or Beneficial Owner be redeemed (the
receipt of notice from a Gaming Authority of any of the foregoing events are collectively referred to herein as
“Gaming Redemption Events”), subject to applicable Gaming Laws, the Issuers will have the right, at their
option:

(i) to require any such holder or Beneficial Owner to dispose of its notes within 30 days (or such earlier date
as may be required by the applicable Gaming Authority) of a Gaming Redemption Event, or

(ii) to call for the redemption of the notes of such holder or Beneficial Owner at a redemption price equal to
the least of:

(A) the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the earlier of the date of
redemption or the date of a Gaming Redemption Event,

(B) the price at which such holder or Beneficial Owner acquired the notes, together with accrued and
unpaid interest to the earlier of the date of redemption or the date of a Gaming Redemption Event, or

(C) such other lesser amount as may be required by any Gaming Authority.

The Issuers will notify the applicable trustee in writing of any such redemption as soon as practicable. The holder
or Beneficial Owner applying for license, qualification or a finding of suitability must pay all costs of the
licensure or investigation for such qualification or finding of suitability.

**Special mandatory redemption**

If (i) the Specified MTA Transactions are not consummated on or before the MTA Transaction Deadline,
(ii) Holdings determines that the Specified MTA Transactions will not be consummated on or before the MTA
Transaction Deadline and gives the applicable trustees written notice to that effect or (iii) the Master Transaction
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or by agreement of the parties thereto, then the Issuers will
be required to redeem all outstanding Special Mandatory Redemption Notes on the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date at a special mandatory redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date.

The “Special Mandatory Redemption Date” means the date specified in the notice of special mandatory
redemption described below, which date shall be a business day that is no earlier than three days and no later than
30 days from the date of such notice.

We will cause notice of any special mandatory redemption to be transmitted, with copies to the applicable
trustees, within five business days after the occurrence of an event triggering a special mandatory redemption to
each applicable holder at its registered address (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes that are due
and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date will be

57


-----

payable on such interest payment dates to the registered holders as of the close of business on the relevant record
dates in accordance with the terms of the Special Mandatory Notes and related indentures. If funds sufficient to
pay the redemption price of the Special Mandatory Redemption Notes to be redeemed on any Special Mandatory
Redemption Date are deposited with the applicable trustees or a paying agent on or before such Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, and certain other conditions are satisfied, on and after such Special Mandatory
Redemption Date, such Special Mandatory Redemption Notes will cease to bear interest.

**Selection and notice of redemption**

If less than all of the notes of any series are to be redeemed at any time (including, with respect to the 2025
Notes, in the case of a special mandatory redemption), the applicable trustee will select notes of such series for
redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of notes issued in global form as discussed under “Book-Entry;
Delivery and Form,” based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the applicable
trustee deems fair and appropriate) unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary
requirements.

No notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Except as otherwise provided above, notices of redemption
will be delivered at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of notes to be
redeemed at its registered address; provided that (a) redemption notices may be sent more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the applicable series of notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the applicable indenture and (b) redemption notices may be sent or given less than
10 days or more than 60 days prior to a redemption if so required by any applicable Gaming Authority in
connection with a redemption described above under the caption “—Gaming redemption.”

If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the portion
of the principal amount of that note that is to be redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the holder of notes upon cancellation of the
original note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of notes called for redemption.

Any redemption or purchase of the notes, including in connection with an Equity Offering or a Change of
Control Offer to Purchase, with the Net Cash Proceeds of an Asset Sale or in connection with another transaction
(or series of related transactions) or event, including any financing, may, at the Issuers’ option, be subject to one
or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity
Offering, Change of Control, Asset Sale or other transaction or event, as the case may be, and notice of such
redemption or purchase may be given prior to the completion or the occurrence of the related Equity Offering,
Change of Control, Asset Sale or other transaction or event. In addition, if such redemption or purchase is subject
to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if
applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the date of redemption or purchase may be delayed until
such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or purchase was sent) as any or all
such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the date of redemption or
purchase, or by the date of redemption or purchase as so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in
the Issuers’ discretion if in the good faith judgment of the Issuers any or all of such conditions will not be
satisfied. In addition, the Issuers may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price
and performance of its obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another
Person.

**Mandatory redemption; sinking fund**

Except as set forth above under “—Special mandatory redemption,” the Issuers will not be required to make any
mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes.

**Covenant suspension**

If, on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the notes are rated Investment Grade by at least two of S&P,
Moody’s and Fitch (or, if any of S&P, Moody’s or Fitch have been replaced in accordance with the definition of
“Rating Agencies,” by at least two of the then-applicable Rating Agencies) and (ii) no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing under the indentures (such date, the “Suspension Date”), the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries will no longer be subject to the covenants in the indentures described below under
the following captions in this “Description of the Notes”:

(1) “—Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(4) “—Covenants—Limitation on dividends and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) “—Covenants—Limitation on transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”;

(7) “—Covenants—Limitation on issuances of Guarantees by Subsidiary Guarantors”;

(8) “—Covenants—Future guarantors”; and

(9) clause (3) of “—Consolidation, merger and sale of assets.”

There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain a rating of Investment Grade from any
Rating Agency.

If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the covenants listed above (such
period, a “Suspension Period”), the notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event of
any Suspension Period as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (such date, a “Reversion Date”)
the notes are no longer rated Investment Grade by two of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch (or, if any of S&P, Moody’s
or Fitch have been replaced in accordance with the definition of “Rating Agencies,” by at least two of the thenapplicable Rating Agencies), then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to
such covenants under the indentures with respect to future events.

The Company shall promptly upon its occurrence deliver to the applicable trustee, an officer’s certificate
notifying such trustee of the occurrence of any Suspension Date or Reversion Date, and the date thereof. The
applicable trustee shall not have any obligation to monitor the occurrence or dates of any Suspension Date or
Reversion Date and may rely conclusively on such officer’s certificate. The applicable trustee shall not have any
obligation to notify the holders of the occurrence or dates of any Suspension Date or Reversion Date.

On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified as having
been Incurred pursuant to the covenants described below under “—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (to
the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred or issued thereunder as of the Reversion Date and
after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion
Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to “—Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under paragraph (4)(D) of the covenant described below under “—Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness.” On each Reversion Date, all Liens incurred during the Suspension Period will be
classified as having been incurred pursuant to the covenants described below under “—Covenants—Limitation
on Liens” (to the extent such Liens would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and
after giving effect to Liens incurred prior to the Suspension Period and existing on the Reversion Date). To the
extent such Liens would not be so permitted to be incurred pursuant to “—Covenants—Limitation on Liens,”
such Liens will be deemed to have been existing on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under

59


-----

paragraph (36) of “Permitted Liens.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be
made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described below under “—Covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments” will be made as though such covenant had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior, but
not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not
reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described below under
“—Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” As described above, however, no Default or Event of
Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company
or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. Within 30 days of such Reversion Date, or as such
period may be extended as a result of delays relating to a Gaming Authority or Governmental Authority, the
Company shall comply with the terms of the covenant described below under “—Covenants—Future
guarantors.”

For purposes of the covenant described below under “—Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales,” on the
Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero.

During any Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be subject to the following
maintenance covenant (the “Maintenance Covenant”):

**_Maintenance of Total Unencumbered Assets_**

The Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall maintain Total Unencumbered Assets as of the end of each
fiscal quarter of not less than 150% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Company’s and its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ Unsecured Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter, all calculated on a consolidated
basis in accordance with GAAP.

On any Reversion Date, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will no longer be subject to the
Maintenance Covenant.

**Covenants**

The indentures will contain, among others, the following covenants.

prohibited by applicable Gaming Law); and provided further that any event which results in any
such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent transfer of such

(F) only if:

(i) such new Indebtedness, by its terms or by the terms of any agreement or instrument pursuant
to which such new Indebtedness is issued or remains outstanding, is expressly made
subordinate in right of payment to the notes at least to the extent that the Indebtedness to be
Refinanced is subordinated to the notes, if applicable; and

(ii) such new Indebtedness, determined as of the date of Incurrence of such new Indebtedness, does
not mature prior to the earlier of (1) the Stated Maturity of the Indebtedness to be Refinanced, or
(2) the date that is 91 days after the Stated Maturity of the notes, and the Average Life of such
new Indebtedness is at least equal to the earlier of (1) the remaining Average Life of the
Indebtedness to be Refinanced, or (2) 91 days more than the Average Life of the notes;

_provided further that in no event may Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor that_
ranks equally with or subordinate in right of payment to the notes or such Subsidiary Guarantor’s
Note Guarantee, as applicable, be Refinanced by means of any Indebtedness of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to this clause (F);

that the Company may divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in one or more of the types of
Indebtedness and may later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that
complies within this covenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Indebtedness under the PropCo Credit
Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will at all times be treated as Incurred on the Issue Date in
reliance on the exception provided by clause (4)(A) of this covenant.

(8) The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(A) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount;

(B) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or

upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, unless all payments due under the
indentures and the notes are secured on an equal and ratable or prior basis with the Obligations so secured until
such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that any Lien meets the criteria of more
than one of the types of Liens described under the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Company, in its sole
discretion, may classify such Lien in one such type of Permitted Liens; provided that the Company may divide
and classify a Lien in one or more of the types of Permitted Liens and may later reclassify all or a portion of such
Lien, in any manner that complies within this covenant.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or with respect to its Capital Stock held by
Persons other than the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than:

(A) dividends or distributions payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock); and

(B) pro rata dividends or distributions payable by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not wholly owned to
minority stockholders (or owners of equivalent interests if such Restricted Subsidiary is not a
corporation);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Equity Interests of the Company held by any
Person other than the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

Guarantor (other than (A) with respect to intercompany Subordinated Indebtedness or (B) the purchase,
repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness in
anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due
within one year of the date of such purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or
retirement); or

(4) make an Investment, other than a Permitted Investment, in any Person,

(all such payments and any other actions described in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to
as “Restricted Payments”) if, at the time of, and after giving effect to, the proposed Restricted Payment:

(A) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(B) the Company could not Incur at least $1.00 of Indebtedness in compliance with both paragraphs
(1) and (3) of the covenant described above under the caption “—Covenants—Limitation on

65


-----

(C) the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments (the amount, if other than in cash, to be the Fair
Market Value thereof as determined by the Company) made on or after October 1, 2019 (for the
avoidance of doubt, not including any Restricted Payments declared prior to October 1, 2019 but
paid on or after October 1, 2019) (other than those referred to in clauses (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8),
(9) and (11) through (24) of the third paragraph of this covenant) would exceed the sum of:

(i) 95% of the aggregate amount of Funds From Operations (or, if Funds From Operations is a
loss, minus 100% of the amount of such loss) accrued on a cumulative basis during the period
(taken as one accounting period) commencing October 1, 2019 and ending on the last day of
the most recent Fiscal Quarter preceding the Transaction Date for which internal financial
statements are available; plus

(ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value of other property received

Company (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preferred Stock, Excluded Contributions
and any Permitted Warrant Transaction), (b) a contribution to the common equity capital of
the Company (other than Excluded Contributions) or (c) the issue or sale of Convertible
Indebtedness upon the conversion of such Convertible Indebtedness into Equity Interests

(iii) an amount equal to the net reduction in Investments (other than reductions in Permitted
Investments) in any Person resulting from payments of interest on Indebtedness, dividends,
repayments of loans or advances, or other transfers of assets, in each case to the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or from the net cash proceeds from the sale of any such
Investment (except, in each case, to the extent any such payment or proceeds have already
been included in the calculation of Funds From Operations) or from redesignations of
Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (valued in each case as provided in the
definition of “Investment”) not to exceed, in each case, the amount of Investments previously
made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may declare or pay any
dividend or make any distribution to their equity holders to fund a dividend or distribution by Holdings (and
make any corresponding distributions to the Company’s partners other than Holdings) so long as Holdings
believes in good faith that (1) Holdings qualifies as a REIT under the Code and (2) the declaration or payment of
such dividend, in each case, by Holdings, or the making of such distribution is necessary either (A) to maintain
Holdings’ status as a REIT under the Code for any calendar year or (B) to enable Holdings to avoid payment of
any tax for any calendar year that could be avoided by reason of a distribution by Holdings to its shareholders,
with such distribution by Holdings to be made as and when determined by Holdings, whether during or after the
end of the relevant calendar year.

The foregoing provisions will not be violated by reason of:

(1) the redemption, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor including premium, if any, and accrued and
unpaid interest and related transaction expenses, with the proceeds of, or in exchange for, other
Subordinated Indebtedness Incurred under clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4)(F) of the covenant described above
under the caption “—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment or Investment in an aggregate amount outstanding pursuant to this
clause (2) not to exceed the amount of Excluded Contributions received by the Company after the Issue
Date (with each such Investment being measured as of the date made and without giving effect to any
subsequent changes in value);

(3) the payment of any dividend, distribution or redemption of any Equity Interests or Subordinated Indebtedness
within 60 days after the date of declaration or notice thereof or call for redemption if, at such date of declaration

66


-----

or notice or call for redemption, such payment or redemption was permitted by the provisions of the first
paragraph of this covenant (the declaration of such payment will be deemed a Restricted Payment under the first
paragraph of this covenant as of the date of declaration and the payment itself will be deemed to have been made
on the date of declaration and will not also be deemed a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph of this
covenant); provided, however, that any Restricted Payment made in reliance on this clause (3) shall reduce the
amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (C) of the first paragraph of this covenant only
once;

accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon, up to the principal amount of notes that would otherwise
be prepaid;

(4) fund all or a portion of an optional redemption of the notes as described under “—Optional
redemption” or repurchase the notes in open market transactions if such repurchase is not otherwise
prohibited by the indentures;

(5) make a capital expenditure; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing;

75


-----

_provided, that the Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions described in clauses (2) and_
(5) of this paragraph if and to the extent that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries enter into a
definitive agreement committing to make such acquisition or capital expenditure or so invest within such
365-day period, which acquisition, capital expenditure or investment shall be made within 180 days after the end
of such 365-day period.

Pending the application of any such Net Cash Proceeds as described above, the Company may invest such Net
Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indentures. The amount of such excess Net Cash
Proceeds required to be applied (or to be committed to be applied) during such 365-day period as set forth in the
preceding sentence and not applied (or committed to be applied) as so required by the end of such period will
constitute “Excess Proceeds.” If, as of the first day of any calendar month, the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds not previously subject to an Offer to Purchase pursuant to this covenant totals more than $100 million,
the Company must commence, not later than 20 Business Days thereafter, and consummate an Offer to Purchase
from the holders of the notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes containing
provisions similar to those set forth in the indentures with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the
proceeds of sales of assets, on a pro rata basis, an aggregate principal amount of notes and such other pari passu
Indebtedness equal to the Excess Proceeds on such date, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, to the
Payment Date.

If the aggregate principal amount of notes and other pari passu Indebtedness with the notes tendered into such
Offer to Purchase exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, then the notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness
will be purchased on a pro rata basis based on the principal amount of the notes and such other pari passu
Indebtedness tendered. Upon completion of each Offer to Purchase, any remaining Excess Proceeds subject to
such Offer to Purchase will no longer be deemed to be Excess Proceeds and may be applied to any other purpose
not prohibited by the indentures.

**_Repurchase of notes upon a Change of Control_**

Unless the Company has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all existing notes as
described above under the caption “—Optional redemption” and all conditions precedent applicable to such
redemption notice have been satisfied, within 30 days following any Change of Control or, at the option of the
Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after public announcement of the transaction or transactions that
constitute or may constitute the Change of Control, the Company will be required to commence an Offer to
Purchase for all notes then outstanding at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the Payment Date. The Offer to Purchase will, if sent prior to the date
on which the Change of Control occurs, describe the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute
the Change of Control, and state that the Offer to Purchase is conditioned on the Change of Control occurring on
or prior to the applicable Payment Date.

There can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient funds available at the time of any Change of
Control to make any debt payment (including repurchases of notes) required by the foregoing covenant (as well
as any covenant that may be contained in other securities of the Company or that might be outstanding at the
time).

Subject to the following paragraph, the provisions described above that require the Company to make an Offer to
Purchase following a Change of Control will be applicable regardless of whether any other provisions of the
indentures are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the indentures shall not
contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the
notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, holders of notes may not be
entitled to require the Company to purchase their notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in
the composition of the Company’s Board of Directors.

76


-----

The Company will not be required to make an Offer to Purchase upon a Change of Control if a third party makes
the Offer to Purchase in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in
the indentures applicable to an Offer to Purchase made by the Company and purchases all notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn under such Offer to Purchase.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer to Purchase and the Company, or any third party making an
Offer to Purchase in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Company will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer to Purchase
described above, to redeem all notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but not including,
such purchase date.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of notes as a result of Change of
Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
covenant described hereunder, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached our obligations under the covenant described hereunder by virtue of our compliance
with such securities laws or regulations.

If the terms of any Credit Facilities prohibit the Company from making an Offer to Purchase or from purchasing
the notes pursuant thereto, prior to the sending of the notice to holders, but in any event within 30 days following
any Change of Control, the Company covenants to:

(1) repay in full all Indebtedness outstanding under such Credit Facilities or offer to repay in full all such
Indebtedness and repay the Indebtedness of each lender who has accepted such offer; or

(2) obtain the requisite consent under such Credit Facilities to permit the purchase of the notes as described
above.

The Company must first comply with the covenants described in clauses (1) and (2) above before it will be
required to purchase notes in the event of a Change of Control; provided, however, that the Company’s failure to
comply with the covenant described in the preceding sentence or to make an Offer to Purchase because of any
such failure shall constitute a Default described in clause (4) under “ —Events of Default” below (and not under
clause (3) thereof); provided further, if the Company has instituted any liability management procedures or is
otherwise engaged in obtaining the requisite consents under such Credit Facilities to permit the purchase of the
notes (such engagement to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion), the Company shall have an
additional 30 days following the initial 30-day period after the occurrence of a Change of Control to secure such
consents and no Default shall have occurred if such consents are obtained within such 30-day period.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a holder of notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the notes as described above.

The provisions under the indentures governing the notes relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of
the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.

**_Commission reports and reports to holders_**

Whether or not the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
the Company will provide the trustees and the holders of notes within 15 Business Days after filing, or in the
event no such filing is required, within 15 Business Days after the end of the time periods specified in those
sections and any extension period granted under Section 12b-25 of the Exchange Act with:

(1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing with
the Commission on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the Company were required to file such forms,
including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and, with respect to the annual financial statements only, a report thereon by the
Company’s independent accountants; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the Commission on Form 8-K if the
Company were required to file such reports;

_provided that the foregoing delivery requirements will be deemed satisfied if the foregoing materials are_
available on the Commission’s EDGAR system or on the Company’s website within the applicable time period
specified above (provided that if posted to a secure internet portal, the Company will separately electronically
deliver such reports to the trustees).

If a Parent Entity has provided the information as required by the foregoing paragraphs as if such Parent Entity
were the Company, the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied such requirements; provided the Parent Entity
provides to the trustees and the holders unaudited supplemental financial information substantially similar to that
included in this offering memorandum that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information
relating to such Parent Entity and any of its Subsidiaries other than the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone
basis, on the other hand.

For so long as any of the notes remain outstanding and constitute “restricted securities” under Rule 144, the
Company will furnish to the holders of the notes and prospective investors, upon their request, the information
required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be deemed to have failed to comply with
any provision of this reporting covenant for purposes of clause (4) set forth below under the caption “Events of
Default” as a result of the late filing or provision of any required information or report until 90 days after the date
any such information or report was due.

Delivery of reports, information and documents referred to above to the trustees is for informational purposes
only and the trustees’ receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information
contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with
any of its covenants under the indentures (as to which the trustees are entitled to rely exclusively on officer’s
certificates).

**_Limited Condition Transactions_**

The indentures will provide that, in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction (including any financing
thereof), at the Issuers’ election, (a) compliance with any requirement relating to the absence of a Default or
Event of Default may be determined as of the date a definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction
is entered into (the “effective date”) and not as of any later date as would otherwise be required under the
indentures, and (b) any calculation contemplated by the subheading “—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
or any amount based on any other calculation or determination under any basket or ratio under the indentures,
may be made as of such effective date, giving Pro Forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and any

78


-----

related transactions (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had
occurred at the beginning of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the effective date. The indentures will
also provide that, if the Company makes such an election, any subsequent calculation of any such ratio, basket
and/or percentage (unless the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction expires or is
terminated without its consummation) shall be calculated on an equivalent Pro Forma Basis. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Issuers may at any time withdraw any election made hereunder.

**_Events of Default_**

“Events of Default” under the applicable indenture are defined as the following:

(1) default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on any note of the applicable series when the
same becomes due and payable at maturity, upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise;

(2) default in the payment of interest on any note of the applicable series when the same becomes due and
payable, and such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(3) default in the performance or breach of the covenant described below under the caption “ —Consolidation,
merger and sale of assets” or the failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to make or
consummate an Offer to Purchase in accordance with the covenants described above under the captions “
—Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” and “ —Covenants—Repurchase of notes upon a Change of
Control”;

(4) default in the performance of or breach of any other covenant or agreement in the applicable indenture or
under the applicable notes (other than a default specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) above) and such default or
breach continues for a period of 60 consecutive days after written notice by the applicable trustee or the
holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the applicable notes, provided that a notice of
default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders of the notes,
more than two years prior to such notice of default;

(5) there occurs with respect to any issue or issues of Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Significant Subsidiary
having an outstanding principal amount of (i) $200 million or more in the aggregate, in the case of
Recourse Indebtedness (other than the notes), or (ii) $300 million or more in the aggregate, in the case of
Non-Recourse Indebtedness, in each case, for all such issues of all such Persons, whether such
Indebtedness now exists or is created after the date of the applicable indenture:

(A) an event of default that has caused the holders thereof to declare such Indebtedness to be due and
payable prior to its Stated Maturity and such Indebtedness has not been discharged in full or such
acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled within 30 days of such acceleration; and/or

(B) the failure to make a principal payment at the final (but not any interim) fixed maturity and such
defaulted payment shall not have been made, waived or extended within 30 days of such payment
default;

(6) other than in connection with any transaction not prohibited by “—Master Leases,” any Significant Master
Lease shall have terminated (other than in accordance with the terms of such Significant Master Lease);
_provided that such termination shall not constitute an Event of Default (and neither the applicable trustee_
nor any holder of notes shall take any corresponding actions as if such termination constituted an Event of
Default) if within 90 days after such termination the Company has entered into one or more Permitted
Replacement Leases;

(7) any final judgment or order (not covered by insurance) for the payment of money in excess of $200 million
for all such final judgments or orders against the Company, the Co-Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary;

(A) is rendered against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary and is not paid or discharged; and

79


-----

(B) there shall be any period of 60 consecutive days following entry of the final judgment or order that
causes the aggregate amount for all such final judgments or orders outstanding and not paid or
discharged against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to exceed $200 million during which
a stay of enforcement of such final judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise,
shall not be in effect;

(8) a court having jurisdiction enters a decree or order for:

(A) relief in respect of Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case
under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect;

(B) appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of
Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property
and assets of Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; or

(C) the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary
and, in each case, such decree or order remains unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive
days;

(9) Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary:

(A) commences a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now
or hereafter in effect, or consents to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under such
law;

(B) consents to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian,
trustee, sequestrator or similar official of Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or
for all or substantially all of the property and assets of Holdings, the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary;

(C) effects any general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or

(D) any Note Guarantee ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of
such Note Guarantee and the applicable indenture) or any Subsidiary Guarantor notifies the trustee
in writing that it denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (8) or (9) above that occurs with respect
to Holdings, the Company or any Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing under the applicable indenture,
the applicable trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable notes then
outstanding, by written notice to the Issuers (and to the applicable trustee if such notice is given by the holders),
may, and the applicable trustee at the request of the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
applicable series of notes then outstanding will, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on
the notes to be immediately due and payable. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued interest will be immediately due and payable. In the event of a declaration of acceleration
because an Event of Default set forth in clause (5) above has occurred and is continuing, such declaration of
acceleration will be automatically rescinded and annulled if the event of default triggering such Event of Default
pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured by the Issuers or the relevant Significant Subsidiary or waived
by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 60 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (8) or (9) above occurs with respect to Holdings, the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the notes then outstanding will
automatically become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
applicable trustee or any holder.

80


-----

The holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding notes by written
notice to the Issuers and to the applicable trustee, may waive all past defaults and rescind and annul a declaration
of acceleration and its consequences if:

(X) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
the notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived, and

(Y) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

As to the waiver of defaults, see “—Modification and waiver.”

The holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding notes may
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the applicable trustee
or exercising any trust or power conferred on such trustee. However, such trustee may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the applicable indenture, that may involve such trustee in personal liability, or
that such trustee determines in good faith may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of notes not joining
in the giving of such direction and may take any other action it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any
such direction received from holders of notes. A holder may not pursue any remedy with respect to the applicable
indenture or the applicable series of notes unless:

(1) the holder gives the applicable trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;

(2) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of outstanding notes
make a written request to the applicable trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holder or holders offer the applicable trustee indemnity and security satisfactory to such trustee
against any costs, liability or expense;

(4) the applicable trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the
provision of indemnity and security; and

(5) during such 60-day period, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series
of outstanding notes do not give the applicable trustee a direction that is inconsistent with the request.

However, such limitations do not apply to the right of any holder of a note to receive payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on, such note or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the
due date expressed in the notes, which right shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the holder.

The indentures will require certain officers of the Issuers to certify, on or before a date not more than 120
Business Days after the end of each fiscal year, that a review has been conducted of the activities of the Issuers
and the Restricted Subsidiaries and of their performance under the applicable indenture and that the Issuers and
the Restricted Subsidiaries have fulfilled all obligations thereunder, or, if there has been a default in fulfillment
of any such obligation, specifying each such default and the nature and status thereof. In addition, so long as any
of the notes are outstanding, the indentures will require the Issuers to deliver to the applicable trustee, within 30
Business Days upon becoming aware of any Event of Default, a statement specifying such Event of Default.

**Master Leases**

Neither the Issuers nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall (i) amend or modify any of the Significant Master
Leases in any manner that would materially impair the ability of the Issuers to satisfy their obligations to make
payments on the notes (as determined in good faith by the Company) or (ii) grant any waiver or release under or
terminate any Significant Master Lease in any manner if such granting or termination would materially impair
the ability of the Issuers to satisfy their obligations to make payments on the notes (as determined in good faith
by the Company); provided that the amendments and modifications to the Significant Master Leases
contemplated by that certain Master Transaction Agreement, dated as of June 24, 2019, by and between the
Company and ERI, as in effect on the Issue Date, shall be deemed to not materially impair the ability of the
Issuers to satisfy their obligations to make payments on the notes.

81

**Consolidation, merger and sale of assets**

**_Company and Co-Issuer_**

Neither the Company nor the Co-Issuer will consolidate or merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or
otherwise dispose (collectively, a “transfer”) of all or substantially all of its property and assets (as an entirety or
substantially an entirety in one transaction or a series of related transactions) to, any Person or permit any Person
to merge with or into the Company unless:

(1) the Company or the Co-Issuer, as applicable, is the continuing Person, or the Person (if other than the
Company or the Co-Issuer, as applicable) formed by such consolidation or into which the Company or the
Co-Issuer, as applicable, is merged or that acquired such property and assets of the Company or the
Co-Issuer, as applicable, is an entity organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of
America or any state or jurisdiction thereof (such Person, a “Successor Company”) and expressly assumes,
by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the applicable trustee, all of the obligations of the
Company or the Co-Issuer, as applicable, on the notes and under the applicable indenture; provided, that
any Successor Company to the Co-Issuer must be a corporation;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing;

(3) in the case of a transaction involving the Company, immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a
Pro Forma Basis, the Company, or any Person becoming the successor obligor of the notes, as the case
may be, (A) could Incur at least $1.00 of Indebtedness in compliance with both paragraphs (1) and (3) of
the covenant described under the caption “—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (B) has a Total
Net Debt to Adjusted Total Assets Ratio that is no higher than the Total Net Debt to Adjusted Total Assets
Ratio of the Company immediately before giving effect to the transaction and any related Incurrence of
Indebtedness; provided that this clause (3) will not apply to (i) a consolidation or merger of one or more
Restricted Subsidiaries with or into the Company or (ii) any merger effected solely to change the state of
domicile of the Company; and

(4) if the Company or the Co-Issuer, as applicable, will not be the continuing Person, the Company delivers to
the applicable trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, in each case stating that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture complies with this provision and that all
conditions precedent provided for herein relating to such transaction have been complied with.

Upon any consolidation or merger or any transfer of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, in
accordance with the foregoing, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company or
the Co-Issuer, as applicable, is merged or to which such transfer is made, will succeed to, be substituted for, and
may exercise every one of the Company’s or the Co-Issuer’s, as applicable, rights and powers under the
applicable indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named therein as the Company or
the Co-Issuer, as applicable, and, except in the case of the lease or a sale or other transfer of less than all assets,
the Company or the Co-Issuer, as applicable, will be released from the obligations under the applicable notes.

**_Subsidiary guarantors_**

No Subsidiary Guarantor will consolidate or merge with or into, or transfer all or substantially all of its property
and assets (as an entirety or substantially an entirety in one transaction or a series of related transactions) to, any
Person (other than the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor), unless:

(1) such Subsidiary Guarantor is the continuing Person, or the Person (if other than such Subsidiary
Guarantor) formed by such consolidation or into which such Subsidiary Guarantor is merged or that
acquired such property and assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor is an entity organized and validly existing
under the laws of the United States of America or any state or jurisdiction thereof and expressly assumes,
by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the applicable trustee, all of the obligations of such
Subsidiary Guarantor on the Note Guarantees and under the applicable indenture; and

82


-----

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Note Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company will be automatically released as set forth under “—Brief description of the notes and the Note
Guarantees—The Note Guarantees.” Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing, this “Consolidation, merger
and sale of assets” section shall not apply to the lease of all or substantially all of the real estate assets of the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to an operator pursuant to a Master Lease.

**Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance**

The Issuers may at any time elect to have all of the Issuers’ obligations discharged with respect to the
outstanding notes of a series and all obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors discharged with respect to their
Note Guarantees of a series of notes (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of such outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium
on, if any, and interest on, such notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of
notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment
and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustees under the indentures, and the Issuers’ and
the Subsidiary Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the indentures.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuers and the
Subsidiary Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including their obligation to make an Offer to
Purchase upon a Change of Control or Asset Sale, as the case may be) that are described in the indentures
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a
Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of
Default described under “—Events of Default” (except those relating to payments on the notes or bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation or insolvency events with respect to the Issuers) will no longer constitute an Event of
Default with respect to the notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the applicable trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the
applicable notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in
amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or
firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium on, if any, and interest on, such
outstanding notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case
may be, and the Issuers must specify whether such notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment
or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers must deliver to the applicable trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to such trustee confirming that (a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been
published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of the applicable indenture, there
has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based
thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding notes will not recognize
income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

83


-----

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers must deliver to the applicable trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to such trustee confirming that the holders of the outstanding notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance
and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times
as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a
Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any
similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of Liens to secure such
borrowings);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the applicable indenture and the
agreements governing any other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which the Issuers
or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors is a party or by which the Issuers or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors
is bound; and

(6) the Issuers must deliver to the applicable trustee an officer’s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have
been complied with.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The applicable indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all notes issued thereunder,
when:

(1) either:

(A) all applicable notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed notes that have
been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter
repaid to the Issuers, have been delivered to the applicable trustee for cancellation; or

(B) all applicable notes that have not been delivered to the applicable trustee for cancellation have
become due and payable by reason of the delivery of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will
become due and payable within one year and the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor have

States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15 that has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior to the redemption
date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data))
most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to, 2022 (in the case of the 2025 Notes),,
2023 (in the case of the 2027 Notes) or, 2025 (in the case of the 2030 Notes) (or in the case of a
satisfaction and discharge of the indentures or a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the indentures,
the Treasury Rate as of two Business Days prior to the date on which funds to pay the notes are deposited with
the trustee); provided that if the period from the redemption date to, 2022 (in the case of the 2025
Notes),, 2023 (in the case of the 2027 Notes) or, 2025 (in the case of the 2030 Notes) is not
equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a yield is given, the Treasury yield
will be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the yields of the
nearest United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the
redemption date to such date is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States
securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be used.

“U.S. Dollar Equivalent” means with respect to any monetary amount in a currency other than U.S. dollars, at
any time for determination thereof, the amount of U.S. dollars obtained by converting such foreign currency
involved in such computation into U.S. dollars at the spot rate for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the applicable
foreign currency as published in The Wall Street Journal in the “Exchange Rates” column under the heading
“Currency Trading” (or if such publication is unavailable, a similar nationally recognized publication as
determined in the Company’s sole discretion) on the date two Business Days prior to such determination. Except
as described under “—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” whenever it is necessary to determine whether
the Company has complied with any covenant in the indentures or a Default has occurred and an amount is
expressed in a currency other than U.S. dollars, such amount will be treated as the U.S. Dollar Equivalent
determined as of the date such amount is initially determined in such currency.

“UCC” means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time in the State of New York or any
other state, the laws of which are required to be applied in connection with the creation or perfection of security
interests.

“Unrestricted Cash” means, as of any date of determination, all cash and Cash Equivalents included in the
balance sheets of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of such date that, in each case, are free and
clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens that do not secure Indebtedness for borrowed money.

“Unrestricted Subsidiary” means

(1) each Specified Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(2) any Subsidiary of the Company that at the time of determination shall be designated an Unrestricted
Subsidiary by the Company in the manner provided below; and

(3) any Subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

The Company may designate (or re-designate) any Restricted Subsidiary (including any newly acquired or newly
formed Subsidiary of the Company) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided that:

(A) any Guarantee by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness of the
Subsidiary being so designated will be deemed an “Incurrence” of such Indebtedness and an
“Investment” by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such designation;

120


-----

(B) either (i) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of $1,000 or less or (ii) if such Subsidiary
has assets greater than $1,000, such designation would be permitted under “—Covenants—
Limitation on Restricted Payments,” above; and

(C) if applicable, the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Investment referred to in clause (A) of this
proviso would be permitted under the provisions of the indentures described above under
“—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments.”

The Company may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that:

(X) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or after giving effect to
such designation; and

(Y) all Liens and Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary outstanding immediately after such designation
would, if Incurred at such time, have been permitted to be Incurred (and will be deemed to have been
Incurred) for all purposes of the indentures.

“Unsecured Debt” means, for any Person, any Indebtedness of such Person or its Restricted Subsidiaries which is
not Secured Indebtedness.

“VICI FC” means VICI FC Inc., a Delaware corporation.

“Voting Stock” means with respect to any Person, Capital Stock of any class or kind ordinarily having the power

-----

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The certificates representing the notes will be issued in fully registered form without interest coupons. Notes
sold in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act initially will be represented by permanent global notes in
fully registered form without interest coupons (each a “Restricted Global Note”) and will be deposited with the
trustee as a custodian for DTC, as depositary, and registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary.

Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be represented
by temporary global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each a “Regulation S Temporary
Global Note”) and will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC, as depositary, and registered in the
name of a nominee of such depositary. Through and including the later of the 40th day after the commencement
of this offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the
“distribution compliance period”), beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held
only through the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) (as indirect
participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Restricted Global Note in
accordance with the certification requirements described below. Within a reasonable time period after the
expiration of the distribution compliance period, the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for
one or more permanent notes in registered global form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S
Permanent Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global
Notes”; the Regulation S Global Notes and the Restricted Global Notes collectively being the “global notes”)
upon certification of compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes and pursuant to Regulation
S as provided in the applicable indenture. Prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period, a
beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in the Restricted Global Note only upon receipt by the trustee of a written certification
from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Transfers of beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note whether
before, on or after such time, to a person that takes delivery through a Regulation S Global Note may be made
only upon receipt by the trustee of a written certification to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S.

The notes (and any notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set
forth therein and in the applicable indenture and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth under
the heading “Notice to Investors” herein.

**Global notes**

We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the global notes, DTC
or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial
interests represented by such global notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such
depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and the
transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with
respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than
participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchaser and ownership of
beneficial interests in the global notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through
participants. Holders may hold their interests in the global notes directly through DTC if they are participants in
such system, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such system.

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the
case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such global notes for all
purposes under the indentures. No beneficial owner of an interest in the global notes will be able to transfer that
interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the applicable
indenture with respect to the notes.

122


-----

Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on, the
global notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. Neither we,
the trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to
or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest.

We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and
interest (including additional interest, if any) on the global notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments
in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global notes as
shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of
beneficial interests in the global notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions
and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers, registered in the
names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds
system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery
of a Certificated Security (as defined below) for any reason, including to sell notes to persons in states that
require physical delivery of the notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in a
global note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the applicable
indenture.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other
hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of
instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance
with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to
its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests
in the relevant global note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for
same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not
deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the
presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the DTC interests in the global notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However,
if there is an event of default under the applicable indenture, DTC will exchange the applicable global notes for
Certificated Securities (as defined below), which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended
as set forth under the heading “Notice to Investors.”

DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York
Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the
Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial
Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC
holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues
that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and
other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and
pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates.
Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing
corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants
such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations

123


-----

that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. The
information above concerning DTC has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no
responsibility for its accuracy.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers or interests in the global notes among participants of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither we nor
the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Certificated securities**

A global note is exchangeable for certificated notes in fully registered form without interest coupons
(“Certificated Securities”) only in the following limited circumstances:

    - DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global note and we fail to
appoint a successor depositary within 90 days of such notice, or

    - there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the notes.

Certificated Securities may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any global note unless the transferor
first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the applicable indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to
Investors.” In no event shall the Regulation S Temporary Global Note be exchanged for Certificated Securities
prior to (a) the expiration of the distribution compliance period and (b) the receipt of any certificates required
under the provisions of Regulation S.

The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities
that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer the notes will be limited to such extent.

**Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Restricted Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global
Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the applicable
indenture) to the effect that the notes are being transferred to a person:

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of
Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting
the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the distribution
compliance period, only if the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in
the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S
or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance
period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

124


-----

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Restricted
Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the trustee through the DTC
Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate
adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a
corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any
beneficial interest in one of the global notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an
interest in the other global note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such global note and will become an
interest in the other global note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other
procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other global note for so long as it remains such an interest.

**MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following summary is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes to persons who purchase notes from us in the offering. The
discussion is for general information only and does not consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that
may be relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes by a holder in light of such holder’s personal
circumstances. In particular, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
ownership of notes by investors that do not hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of
the Code, the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income or the U.S. federal income tax
consequences to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:

    - dealers in securities;

    - traders that elect to mark their securities to market;

    - tax-exempt investors;

    - partnerships, S corporations, or other entities taxed as a pass-through or investors therein;

    - U.S. expatriates or former long-term permanent residents;

    - regulated investment companies, REITs, banks, thrifts, insurance companies or other financial
institutions or financial service entities;

    - persons that hold the notes as a position in a straddle or as part of a synthetic security or hedge,
constructive sale or conversion transaction or other integrated investment;

    - persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income
being recognized on an “applicable financial statement”;

    - U.S. holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; or

    - retirement plans.

Holders subject to the special circumstances described above may be subject to tax rules that differ
significantly from those summarized below.

The term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized
or created in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

    - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

    - a trust (i) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision
over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial
decisions, or (ii) that has a valid election in place to be treated as a domestic trust.

The term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of notes that is an individual, corporation, estate or
trust and is not a U.S. holder.

If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally depends on the status and tax situs of
the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering the purchase of the notes and the
partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors.

126


-----

This summary is based upon the Code, existing and proposed Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder,
administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are
subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the continuing validity of this
discussion. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences
described herein, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS with respect to the
U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning or disposing of the notes.

This discussion does not address the effect of any other U.S. federal tax laws (e.g., federal estate or gift tax
laws) or applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

If you are considering the purchase of the notes, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the
application of U.S. federal income tax laws, as well as other U.S. federal tax laws and the laws of any state, local
or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction, to your particular situation.

**Certain contingent payments**

We may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the notes, including as
described under “Description of the Notes—Repurchase of notes upon a Change of Control” and “Description of
the Notes—Optional redemption.” We may also have the right to redeem the notes for a redemption price that is
less than their initial issue price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as described under “Description of the
Notes—Gaming redemption.” These potential payments may implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations
relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” According to the applicable Treasury regulations, certain
contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if such
contingencies, as of the date of issuance, are remote or incidental. We intend to take the position that the
foregoing contingencies are remote or incidental, and we do not intend to treat the notes as contingent payment
debt instruments. Our position that such contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder unless such
holder discloses to the IRS its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our
position is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, a holder
might be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate (as described below) on
the notes, and to treat as ordinary interest income any gain realized on the taxable disposition of a note. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.
Investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt
instrument rules to the notes.

**Consequences to U.S. holders**

_Stated interest on the notes. Stated interest payable on the notes generally will be includible in your gross_
income when accrued or received in accordance with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, and will be ordinary income.

_Sale or redemption of the notes. Upon the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the_
notes, you will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash or other
property received (other than any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable
as such to the extent not already included in income) and your adjusted tax basis in the notes (your adjusted tax
basis in your notes generally will be your purchase price for the notes). Any gain or loss you realize upon such a
sale or disposition of a note generally will be capital gain or loss. This gain or loss will be long-term capital gain
or loss if your holding period for the notes is greater than one year. Under current law, long-term capital gains of
certain non-corporate holders are generally taxed at lower rates than items of ordinary income. The deductibility
of capital losses is subject to limitations.

_Satisfaction and discharge. Were we to obtain a discharge of the indenture with respect to all of the notes_
then outstanding, as described above under “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and discharge,” such

127


-----

discharge would generally be deemed to constitute a taxable exchange of the outstanding notes for other
property—namely, the funds deposited with the trustee. In such case, a U.S. holder generally would be required
to recognize income and capital gain or loss in connection with such deemed exchange in a manner comparable
to that discussed above under “—Sale or redemption of the notes.” In addition, after such deemed exchange, a
U.S. holder also may be required to recognize income from the property deemed to have been received in such
exchange over the remaining life of the transaction in a manner or amount that is different than had the discharge
not occurred. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to the specific consequences arising from a
discharge in their particular situations.

**Consequences to non-U.S. holders**

_Stated interest on the notes. Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding and FATCA,_
the payment by us or our paying agent of interest to a non-U.S. holder that is not effectively connected with such
holder’s U.S. trade or business will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax, provided that:

    - you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of our capital or profits;

    - you are not a “controlled foreign corporation” that is related to us through stock ownership; and

    - you satisfy certain certification requirements (summarized below).

Under current Treasury regulations. you can meet the foregoing certification requirement if:

    - you (or your agent) deliver to the withholding agent an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or
successor form), signed by you or your agent on your behalf, certifying your non-U.S. status;

    - you hold your notes through a securities clearing organization or certain other financial institutions,
and the organization or institution that holds your notes provides a signed statement to the withholding
agent that is accompanied by an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) provided by
you to that same organization or institution; or

    - you hold your notes directly through a “qualified intermediary” (generally a non-U.S. financial
institution or clearing organization or a non-U.S. branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or
clearing organization that is a party to a withholding agreement with the IRS) and certain conditions
are satisfied.

You should consult your tax advisor regarding the application of the U.S. withholding tax rules to your
particular circumstances.

In the event that you do not meet the foregoing requirements, interest on the notes will be subject to U.S.
federal withholding tax at 30% unless reduced by an applicable income tax treaty.

Interest on your notes that is effectively connected with your U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, you maintain a permanent establishment in the United States to which such interest
is attributable) will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax if you have certified to the withholding agent
(generally, we, or a financial institution acting as our agent, will be the withholding agent) on IRS Form W-8ECI
(or successor form) that you are exempt from such withholding tax. Such interest will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net income basis generally in the same manner as if you were a U.S. holder, unless an applicable
income tax treaty provides otherwise. If a non-U.S. holder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty between the
United States and its country of residence, any interest that is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business
will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the manner specified by the treaty and generally will only be subject
to such tax if such income is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the
United States. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to
30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to
adjustments, that are effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

128


-----

The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the
payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide the applicable
withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income
tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund
with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any
applicable income tax treaty.

_Sale or redemption of the notes. Subject to the discussion below concerning backup withholding, if you sell_
or otherwise dispose of your notes in a transaction that is treated as a taxable sale or exchange for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (including a retirement or redemption), you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on any gain you recognize on this transaction, unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business in the United States
(and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, you maintain a permanent establishment in the
United States to which such gain is attributable); or

    - you are an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the year in which you disposed
of your notes and certain other conditions are met.

A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
net gain derived from the sale generally in the same manner as a non-U.S. holder with respect to the effectively
connected interest described above. The gain may qualify for a lower applicable treaty rate. In addition, if you
are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income
tax treaty rate) of your earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, that are effectively
connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. An individual non-U.S. holder described
in the second bullet point above will be subject to a flat 30% U.S. federal income tax on the gain derived from
the sale, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses, even though the holder is not considered a resident of
the United States (provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to
such losses).

A non-U.S. holder’s ability to claim a loss on the disposition of the notes will be subject to substantial
limitations. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of disposing of the
notes at a loss.

_Satisfaction and discharge. As described above under “—Consequences to U.S. Holders—Satisfaction and_
Discharge,” a non-U.S. holder also may be required to recognize income with respect to the property or rights to
the property deemed to have been received in such taxable exchange over the remaining life of the transaction in
a manner or amount that is different than had the discharge not occurred, and such income may be subject to U.S.
income and/or withholding taxes. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to the specific
consequences arising from a discharge in their particular situations.

**Information reporting and backup withholding**

When required, we or our paying agent will report to the holders of the notes and the IRS amounts paid on
or with respect to the notes, and proceeds from a sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption)
of the notes during each calendar year and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from such payments and proceeds.

You may be subject under certain circumstances to backup withholding at a current rate of 24% with respect
to payments on your notes. Generally, backup withholding will apply only if:

    - you fail to provide your social security number or other taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the
withholding agent;

    - you provide an incorrect TIN;

129


-----

    - in the case of interest payments, you are notified by the IRS that you have failed to properly report
payments of interest and dividends and the IRS has notified us that you are subject to backup
withholding; or

    - you fail, under certain circumstances, to provide the withholding agent with a certified statement,
signed under penalty of perjury, that the TIN you provided is your correct TIN and that you are not
subject to backup withholding.

A U.S. holder who does not provide its correct TIN may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Certain
taxpayers, including corporations and tax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from backup withholding. In
general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding provided that the applicable withholding
agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person, as defined under the
Code, and the holder has satisfied the certification requirements referred to above under “—Consequences to
Non-U.S. Holders.” A non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding with
respect to payments of interest on a note and the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of a note within the
United States or conducted through certain financial intermediaries, unless the payor of the proceeds receives the
statement described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United
States person, as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient or the holder otherwise establishes an
exemption.

Proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note effected outside the United States
through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker without specified U.S. connections generally will not be subject
to backup withholding or information reporting.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be refunded or credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required
information is timely provided to the IRS.

**FATCA**

Under the U.S. tax rules commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), a 30%
U.S. withholding tax may apply to payments made on a note if a non-U.S. holder (i) is, or holds its notes through,
a foreign financial institution that has not entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to report, on an
annual basis, certain information regarding accounts with or interests in the institution held by certain United
States and other persons, or that has been designated as a “nonparticipating foreign financial institution” pursuant
to an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign country, where applicable, or
(ii) fails to provide certain documentation (usually an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) containing information
about its identity, its FATCA status, and if required, its direct and indirect U.S. owners. The terms of an
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign country, if applicable, or of future
Treasury regulations, may further modify these requirements. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax
advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the notes.

terms are defined in Regulation S) pursuant to Regulation S.

(2) The purchaser acknowledges on its own behalf, and each subsequent holder of the notes will be

the meaning of Rules 902 and 903 of the Securities Act, except in compliance with the applicable

issuance by a temporary global certificate that will not be exchangeable for definitive securities until
the expiration of the distribution compliance period and, for persons other than distributors, until
certification of beneficial ownership of the Regulation S notes by a person who is not a U.S. person, or

Each purchaser of notes acknowledges that neither we nor the initial purchasers nor any person representing
us or the initial purchasers have made any representation to you with respect to us or the offering of the notes,
other than the information contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. Each purchaser
of notes agrees that it has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the notes as it has
deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase notes.

Each purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction by us or any of the subsidiary
guarantors or the initial purchasers that would permit a public offering of the notes or the possession, circulation

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement among us and the initial
purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the several initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have severally
agreed to purchase from us, the entire principal amount of the notes.

The obligations of the initial purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to
purchase notes from us, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers will
purchase all of the notes being sold pursuant to the purchase agreement if any of them are purchased.

The initial purchasers initially propose to offer the notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the
cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change the offering
price and any other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their
affiliates. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject, cancel or modify an order of notes in whole or in part.

In the purchase agreement, we have agreed that we will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may
be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction.
In the purchase agreement, each initial purchaser has agreed that:

    - The notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to
those registration requirements.

    - During the initial distribution of the notes, it will offer or sell notes only to persons reasonably believed
to be qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and outside the United States in
compliance with Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the
United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements
of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another
exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, by us or the initial purchasers that
would permit a public offering of the notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering
memorandum or any other material relating to us or the notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is
required. Accordingly, the notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering
memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the notes may be distributed
or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and
regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or
a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to
observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and
resale of the notes. See “Notice to Investors.” Sales of the notes made outside of the United States may be made
by affiliates of the initial purchasers.

The notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the notes. In
addition, the notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to
Investors.” We do not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for the
notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a
market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue any market
making in the notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading

134


-----

market will develop for the notes, that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or that the prices that
you receive when you sell will be favorable. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial
offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance
and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes
and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size,
which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the
notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate
covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed
in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect
of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes or cause the price of the notes to be higher
than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or
syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for its own account and for the accounts of its
customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers.
The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or
recommend to clients that it acquires, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. If the initial
purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates
routinely hedge, and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge or otherwise reduce their
credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers
and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase
of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered
hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes
offered hereby.

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
The initial purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in
the future investment banking, commercial lending and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates for
which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the initial purchasers or their
respective affiliates are holders of the PropCo Notes. As described under “Use of Proceeds”, we intend to use a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering to redeem the PropCo Notes. As a result, such initial purchasers or
their affiliates will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering upon redemption of the PropCo Notes.
Affiliates of the initial purchasers are lenders and/or agents under the PropCo Credit Agreement. Affiliates of the
initial purchasers are also commitment parties to the Bridge Facilities. Following the issuance of the notes, we
expect to reduce the commitments under the Bridge Facilities by $2.0 billion.

Delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about, 2020, which will be the tenth business day
following the date hereof (such settlement being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the
delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by the virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+10, to
specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their
advisors.
